    "body": "\nSingle sign-on (SSO) allows you to give your team members one account for all the systems your company uses. If you have an Azion Enterprise account and have SSO configured for your company, your users can log in to **Real-Time Manager (RTM)** using their SSO credentials.\n\nOnly users with _Account Owner_ status can configure team member login settings using one of two account authentication options: **Azion SSO** or an external **Identity Provider (IdP).**\n\n## Definitions\n\n* **Identity Provider (IdP)**: Identity Provider (IdP): is a trusted entity that allows you to enable single sign-on to access other sites or services, such as Azion. Your users can continue using their corporate user identities without having to remember a specific password or enter credentials each time they access RTM. Azure is an example of an Identity Provider.\n* **Service Provider**: Azion, in this context, is the service provider configured as an application in an identity provider to enable single sign-on.\n* **Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)**: is an open standard protocol for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties, in particular between an Identity Provider and a Service Provider. SAML is an XML-based markup language for security statements (statements that service providers use to make access control decisions). Azion supports the SAML protocol, version 2.0.\n* **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**: OpenID Connect is an open standard identity protocol that uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication and authorization, and then builds identities that uniquely identify users.\n\n## Configuring SSO integration in RTM\n\nAfter creating an SSO application in your identity provider, proceed as follows to configure this integration in RTM:\n\n1. Log into [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/) with your username and password.\n2. Go to the **Account menu** on the upper right corner and click **SSO Management**.\n3. Click the **Add Identity Provider** button and choose the protocol you want to register.\n\nYour Identity Provider will provide you with the information you need to complete the configuration form for each protocol. Azion helps you fill in the fields in each form to make it easier for you.\n\n* To learn how to configure a SAML Identity Provider, click [here](https://docs.github.com/pt/github-ae@latest/admin/identity-and-access-management/managing-iam-for-your-enterprise/configuring-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-enterprise).\n* To learn how to configure an OIDC Identity Provider, click [here](https://docs.github.com/pt/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-cloud-providers).\n\nWhen you have finished setting up an identity provider, click **Save**. You will be redirected to the list of identity providers, where you can view all the providers created in your account.\n\n> You can add as many Identity Providers as you like. However, you can only activate one provider at a time.\n\n## Editing an Identity Provider (IdP) Data\n\n1. Click **SSO Management** in the **Account menu**.\n2. Click the edit icon (...) to open the option to edit the provider.\n3. After making the changes you want, click **Save**.\n\n> You cannot delete an active IdP, but you can disable it. If you choose to disable it, simply choose another external IdP or Azion's SSO.\n\n## Changing your account's Identity Provider\n\n1. Click **SSO Management** in the **Account menu**.\n2. Select the Identity Provider you want to start using.\n3. Next, a confirmation window will open.\n4. Confirm the change.\n\n## SAML Identity Provider\n\n### Configuring a SAML Identity Provider\n\n1. Log on [RTM](https://manager.azion.com/), click **SSO Management** in the **Account menu**.\n2. Click **Add Identity Provider** and choose the **SAML** option.\n3. Choose a name that identifies the Identity Provider.\n4. Fill in the following fields with the data copied from your Identity Provider:\n   * Identity provider’s Entity ID URI\n   * Sign-in URL\n   * Certificate\n5. Finally, click **Save**. You will be redirected to the list of identity providers, where you can view all the providers created in your account.\n\n#### Completing the configuration with Azion as Service Provider in your Identity Provider\n\nTo complete the setup with Azion as a service provider on your Identity Provider, you will need the following information that can be found on the setup form itself:\n\n* Login URL.\n* Assertion Consumer Service URL.\n* Service Provider’s Entity ID URI.\n\nPaste this information into the SSO application configuration form in your Identity Provider. And that's it! The SSO integration is ready to be activated in RTM.\n\n#### Activating the Identity Provider in RTM\n\nBefore activating an identity provider, make sure the SSO application is properly configured in your identity provider.\n\nTo activate an identity provider present in the list of providers registered in your RTM account, simply select it. A confirmation will be requested. Upon confirmation, RTM trusts the authentication of its users to the chosen identity provider.\n\n## OIDC Identity Provider\n\n### Configuring an OIDC Identity Provider\n\n1. Log on **[RTM](https://manager.azion.com/)**, click **SSO Management** in the **Account menu**.\n2. Click **Add Identity Provider** and choose the **OIDC** option.\n3. Choose a name that identifies the Identity Provider.\n4. Fill in the following fields with the data copied from your identity provider:\n   * Authorization URL\n   * UserInfo URL\n   * Token URL\n   * Client IDClient Secret\n   * Scopes\n5. Finally, click **Save**. You will be redirected to the list of identity providers, where you can view all the providers created in your account.\n\n#### Completing the configuration with Azion as Service Provider in your Identity Provider\n\nTo complete the setup with Azion as a service provider on your Identity Provider, you will need the following information that can be found on the setup form itself:\n\n* Login URL\n* Redirect URL\n\nPaste this information into the SSO application configuration form in your Identity Provider. That's it! The SSO integration is ready to be activated in RTM.\n\n#### Activating the Identity Provider in RTM\n\nBefore activating an identity provider, make sure the SSO application is properly configured in your identity provider.\n\nTo activate an identity provider present in the list of providers registered in your RTM account, simply select it. A confirmation will be requested. Upon confirmation, RTM trusts the authentication of its users to the chosen identity provider.\n",

    "body": "\n**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** is an electronic verification method used to secure logins. With MFA, the user must provide at least two pieces of identity evidence to be able to login into their account. In this case, it is a combination of a password and a third-party authenticator application on a mobile device.\n\n> Before you enable this setting on **Real-Time Manager (RTM)**, make sure your mobile device supports an MFA application, such as Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator, by going into your app store (iOS' App Store or Android's Google Play, for example), searching, and downloading it.\n\n---\n\n## Enabling MFA on Real-Time Manager \n\nYou can enable MFA when creating a new user, to set it up to active users, or to secure access to your account.\n\nEnabling MFA to your account:\n\n1. Access **[Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/)**.\n2. Click the **Account Menu** on the top right corner and select **User Preferences**.\n3. Enable the MFA switch.\n4. Click **Save** to finish the process.\n\nEnabling MFA to existing users:\n\n1. Access **[Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/)**.\n2. Click the **Account Menu** on the top right corner and select **Users Management**.\n3. Select the desired user to access their profile.\n4. Enable the MFA switch.\n5. Click **Save** to finish the process.\n\n---\n\n## Setting up an MFA mobile application \n\nTo install an authenticator application on your mobile phone, consult your operational system's app store (such as iOS' App Store or Android's Google Play). You can use Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator applications, for instance.\n\nOnce you have downloaded the application and logged in, follow these steps to connect Azion's account to your chosen authenticator application:\n\n1. Look for the **+** button and click it.\n2. Select the account type you are going to add. The camera will start.\n3. Scan the QR code that appears when you log into **Real-Time Manager**.\n4. Type the six-digit code and click **Verify Code**.\n\nBecause of MFA, it is necessary to have access to your mobile phone to log into RTM, providing the 6-digit code.\n\n---\n\n## Logging to Real-Time Manager using MFA \n\nRead below to log into RTM with Multi-Factor Authentication activated:\n\n1. On RTM's login page, insert your login credentials (e-mail and password) and click **Sign In**.\n2. Start your authenticator application.\n3. Type the six-digit code in the specified space on RTM and click **Verify**.\n\n---\n\n## Resetting MFA \n\nIn case of loss or theft of your mobile phone, you will not be able to log into RTM unless an *Account owner* resets the MFA function.\n\n> Multi-Factor Authentication can be reset only if the MFA enforcement is not mandatory for the account's users.\n\nTo do so, you can ask for an Account owner user to deactivate your MFA function. In case you are an *Account Owner*, proceed as follows:\n\n1. Access [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/).\n2. Click the **Account Menu** on the top right corner and select **Users Management**.\n3. Select the desired user to access their profile.\n4. Disable the MFA switch.\n5. Click **Save** to finish the process.\n\nIf you are the only Account owner within the account, it is necessary to contact the [support](mailto:support@azion.com) team to have the MFA reset.\n\n## Enforcing MFA usage for all users belonging to an account\n\nMFA provides an extra level of security to protect your user credentials. Applying two-step authentication for all users requires user management access, that is, only users with *Account Owner* privileges can enable this setting.\n\nEnforcing MFA for all users linked to an account:\n\n1. Access **[Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/)**.\n2. Click the **Account Menu** on the top right corner and select **Account Settings**.\n3. Under **Authentication Settings**, enable the **Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication** switch.\n\n   > When you enable this item, MFA will be mandatory for all users of the account.\n4. Click **Save** to finish the process.\n\nTo disable this setting, follow the steps above, disable the **Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication** switch and click **Save**.\n\n## Unlink MFA usage from an account\n\nYou can restore your account's MFA usage. If you have lost or replaced the phone used to authenticate your login, or want to authenticate using another device such as a new phone or computer.\n\nTo do so, you can ask for an Account owner user to restore your MFA. In case you are an *Account Owner*, proceed as follows:\n\n1. Access **[Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/)**.\n2. Click the **Account Menu** on the top right corner and select **Users Management**.\n3. Select the user(s) you want to unlink from MFA use.\n4. Click the **Restore Authenticator** button located at the bottom of the page in the **Restore Multi-Factor Authenticator** section.\n5. On the verification pop-up, click **Restore**.\n\n> From that point on, the user will be required to enable the authenticator again the next time he logs in.\n",

Access [RTM](https://manager.azion.com/).\n2. In the **Account Menu** on the top right corner, select **Personal Tokens**.\n3. Hover over the Personal Token item you want to delete and click the **trash can** icon.\n4. On the verification pop-up, type **delete**.\n5. Click the **Delete** button.\n\nThat's it!

Log in to [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/).\n2. On the upper-right corner of the page, select the avatar menu. This is the **Account menu**.\n3. Click in **Teams Permissions**.\n\n---\n\n## Adding teams\n\nYou can create teams before or after adding users as they are independent actions.\n\nTake these steps to add a new team:\n\n1. Log in to [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/) and select **Teams Permissions**, as described in [Accessing Teams Permissions](#accessingteamspermissions).\n2. On the **Teams Permission** screen, click **Add team**.\n3. Type a name for the new team in the field **Name for Team**.\n4. In the **Permissions** section, you'll see the *Available Permission*s and *Chosen Permissions* selection boxes.\n5. Click in the permission you want to grant to the team in **Available Permissions** and then on the **arrow** to move it to Chosen Permissions.\n\nBy selecting permissions, you grant access to the functions set for that permission to users on that team only.\n\n> Permissions are independent from each other. For example, the Edit Users permission doesn't enable a team to view users. In that case, you must activate View Users as well.\n\n### Activating your Configurations\n\nAt the bottom of the screen, you'll find the following options:\n\n- **Active**: this button enables or disables a team on the system.\n- **Cancel**: with this option, you return to the **Teams Permissions** page and discard any edits.\n- **Save**: once you finish your settings, click the **Save** button.\n\nWhen you save your configurations, you'll return to the **Teams Permissions** screen, where you'll see the list of teams, their permissions, and whether they are Active or not.\n\n---\n\n## Modifying team permissions\n\nYou can modify the team permissions in **Real-Time Manager** whenever you like.\n\n1. Log in to [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/) and select **Teams Permissions**, as described in [Accessing Users and Teams](#Accessingusersandteams).\n2. On the **Teams Permissions** screen, select the desired team.\n3. Change permissions through the selection boxes. \n\n> The selection process is the same as for the selection boxes described in [Adding teams](#addingteams).\n\n### Activating your Configurations\n\nAt the bottom of the screen, you'll find the following options:\n\n- **Active**: this button enables or disables a team on the system.\n- **Cancel**: with this option, you return to the **Teams Permissions** page and you also discard any edits.\n- **Save**: once you finish your settings, click the **Save** button.\n\nWhen you save your configurations, you'll return to the **Teams Permissions** screen, where you'll see the list of teams, their permissions, and whether they are Active or not.\n\n---\n\n## Deleting teams\n\nBefore deleting teams, you must remove all users from the team.\n\nFollow these instructions:\n\n1. Log in to [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/) and select **Teams Permissions**, as described in [Accessing Users and Teams](#Accessingusersandteams).\n2. On the **Teams Permissions** screen, when hovering the mouse cursor over teams, you'll see the trash can icon being enabled. Click the trash can to delete a team.\n3. When you click the trash can, a message will appear asking you to confirm the deletion. To confirm, type the required word in the text box.\n4. After that, click the **Delete** button to confirm the deletion request. You'll then return to the **Teams Permissions** screen, where a confirmation message is displayed.\n",

    "body": "\nIn this documentation, you'll find guidance on how to manage users on **Real-Time Manager (RTM)**.\n\nLearn how to add, delete, or change account information.\n\nBefore starting your settings, make sure you have the necessary permissions according to the following instructions.\n\n---\n\n## Accessing Users Management\n\n> You must be the Account Owner or have the Edit Users permission to perform these settings.\n\nFollow these instructions to access Users Management:\n\n1. Log in to [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/).\n2. On the upper-right corner of the page, select the avatar menu. This is the **Account menu**.\n3. Click in **Users Management**.\n\n---\n\n## Adding users to an account\n\nYou can add users before or after creating teams, as they are independent actions. See how to add teams in the [Teams Permissions](/en/documentation/products/accounts/teams-permissions/) documentation.\n\nTake these steps to add a new user:\n\n1. Log in to [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/) and select **Users Management**, as described in [Accessing Users Management](#Accessingusersmanagement).\n2. On the Users Management screen, click **Add user**. You'll see three sections: *User profile*; *Contact information*; and *Security settings*. Fill in the fields as prompted.\n\n> Fields marked with an asterisk are required.\n\n### User profile\n\n**First name**: new user first name.\n**Last name**: new user last name.\n**Timezone**: select the timezone where the new user is located. Choosing the correct timezone guarantees precision when accessing data and metrics on RTM.\n**Language**: English is the only language currently available on RTM.\n\n### Contact information\n\n**Email**: new user email address. The user will apply the provided email address as a login credential.\n**Mobile**: new user mobile number.\n\n### Security settings\n\n**Account owner**: by enabling this function, the new user will be set as an Account owner. They will be allowed access to all configurations, including the management of solutions and all accounts as well.\n\nWhen this function is disabled, the user will be set as a Non-owner, with restricted access according to the permission settings defined in Teams.\n\n**Teams**: teams have different access permissions. Thus, you must select a team to allocate Non-owners, unlike Account owners, who have permission to access all teams.\n\nIf you haven't yet created a team when adding a user, you can choose the Default Team [from RTM](https://manager.azion.com/).\n\n> Non-owner access permissions depend on the permissions granted to the team they are allocated to.\n\nYou can also allocate Non-owners to more than one team, which expands the permission possibilities for the same user. See [Team Permissions](/en/documentation/products/accounts/teams-permissions/) for more details.\n\n**Multi-Factor Authentication**: this option enables/disables Multi-factor Authentication (MFA). MFA is a verification method that ensures better account security when it's activated.\n\n> To ensure data security, keep login access information confidential.\n\n### Select boxes: Available Teams and Chosen Teams\n\n1. To select the teams where the user will be allocated, click the desired **team** in **Available Teams** and then on the **arrow** to move your selection to the **Chosen Teams** box.\n\n   In order to speed up the process, you can select more than one team at the same time:\n\n   - You can select all teams at once using the *Choose all* option, located below the Available Teams box.\n   - You can also select in sequence by holding down the Shift key while clicking on the desired options.\n   - Or alternatively select by holding down the Ctrl or Cmd key while clicking on the desired teams.\n2. You can also undo your selection at any time. Click the desired **team** in Chosen Teams and then the **arrow** to move your selection back to the Available Teams box.\n\nYou can still deselect all teams at once by using the *Clear selection* option, located below the Chosen Teams box, and use the Shift, Ctrl or Cmd keys, as described above.\n\n### Activating your Configurations\n\nAt the bottom of the screen, you'll find the following options:\n\n- **Cancel**: with this option, you return to the Users page, and you also discard any edits.\n- **Save**: once you finish your settings, click the **Save** button.\n\nWhen you save your configurations, you return to the Users Management screen, where you'll see the list of users sorted by contact details, the team they belong to, MFA status, and whether they are *Active* or not.\n\n> New users will receive an automatic email to activate the account, which will be available for 14 days. If it's not activated within that period, they will be automatically removed from RTM.\n\n---\n\n## Changing users information\n\nYou can always change the users profile information and their settings as well.\n\nFollow these instructions:\n\n1. Access [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/) and select **Users Management**, as described in [Accessing Users Management](#Accessingusersmanagement).\n2. On the **Users Management** screen, select the desired user to access their profile and make the necessary changes.\n\n> Users can also modify their information on the [Your Settings](https://manager.azion.com/user) page. See more information on the [documentation page](/en/documentation/products/accounts/your-settings/).\n\n### Activating your Configurations\n\nAt the bottom of the screen, you'll find the following options:\n\n- **Active**: this button enables or disables a user on the system.\n- **Cancel**: with this option, you return to the **Users Management** page, and you also discard any edits.\n- **Save**: once you finish your settings, click the **Save** button.\n\nWhen you save your configurations, you return to the **Users Management** screen, where you'll see the list of users sorted by contact details, the team they belong to, MFA status, and whether they are Active or not.\n\n---\n\n## Deleting users\n\nTo delete users, follow these steps:\n\n1. Log in to [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/) and select **Users Management**, as described in [Accessing Users Management](#Accessingusersmanagement).\n2. On the **Users Management** screen, when hovering the mouse cursor over users, you'll see the trash can icon being enabled. Click the trash can to delete the desired user.\n3. When you click the trash can, a message will appear asking you to confirm the deletion. To confirm, type the required word in the text box.\n4. After that, click the **Delete** button to confirm the deletion request. You'll then return to the **Users Management** screen, where a confirmation message will be displayed. \n",

    "body": "\n*Last updated September 29, 2017.*\n\nThis Azion Customer Agreement (\"Agreement\") establishes the general conditions applicable to your access and use of Azion Products and Services, and is entered into between Azion Technologies LLC, a company registered in Delaware, USA (\"Azion\") and you or the entity that represents (\"Customer\"), jointly referred to as \"Parties\" and individually and indistinctly as \"Party\". From now on, you declare that you are legally able to enter into contracts and have legal authority with the entity you represent.\n\n## 1. Use of Products and Services\n\n1.1. Customer may access and use the Azion Products and Services according to this Agreement. A Service Level Agreement may apply to Products and Services. Customer is required to comply with all of the terms in this Agreement and all laws, rules and regulations applicable to the use of our Products and Services, including our Terms of Service, Acceptable Use Policy and other terms set in Section 14, as well as any documents attached hereto.\n\n1.2. To access our Products and Services, Customer must hold an account with Azion associated to a valid e-mail address. Information on initial provisional access will be emailed by Azion. Once expressly allowed, Customer may create a main account and multiple access accounts, but always one account per email address. Customer is responsible for setting their policy on the access password use and all activities taking place through their account, regardless of whether such activities are carried out by Customer, Customer’s employees or a third party (including their contractors and representatives) and, save for a breach of this Agreement, Azion and our affiliates will not be liable for unauthorized access to Customer’s account. Customer will immediately notify Azion in case Customer believes an unauthorized third party has been using Customer’s account or in the event Customer’s account information has been lost or stolen.\n\n## 2. Statement of Liability\n\n2.1. Customer is entirely responsible for developing, implementing, operating, keeping and using Customer’s Content and our Products and Services, such as (a) technical operations, including controlling and managing the use and overage use and ensuring the calls made to any Product or Service are compatible with Service APIs; (b) compliance with our Acceptable Use Policy, other policies and the law by Customer’s Content; (c) any Customer Content-related needs; (d) properly handling and processing notices (even those received by Customer’s affiliates) sent by any persons or entities claiming Customer’s Content violates their rights, including notices under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).\n\n2.2 Customer states to be entirely aware of the risks involved in using the internet, which may lead to significant losses, especially financial ones, and Customer agrees Customer is solely responsible for taking precautions regarding such risks which include, but are not limited to, Content theft, theft of signal, hotlinks, improper redistribution of Content, hacker attacks, copyright violations, and others.\n\n2.3 Azion will not be accountable for any direct or indirect damage or losses Customer may suffer or cause to third parties as a result of Customer’s use of the internet. In case any lawsuits or administrative proceedings are brought against Azion by third parties as a result of damage or losses caused by Customer, Azion will notify Customer and Customer will take over as defendant and request the immediate exclusion of Azion. Nevertheless, in case Azion is forced to make any expenditures as a result of the action, Customer will fully reimburse Azion within 10 (ten) business days counted from the date of our request.\n\n2.4 Customer is responsible for properly configuring and using our Products and Services and for taking steps to keep Customer’s Content safe, protected and duly backed up, which may include not only the use of encryption technology to protect Customer’s Content from unauthorized access but also making backups of said content on a regular basis.\n\n2.5 Azion login credentials are for Customer’s sole use. Customer is not allowed to sell, assign, or sublicense them to any other entities or persons other than by creating an Azion account for Customer’s representatives and contractors working on Customer’s behalf.\n\n2.6 Customer will be solely accountable for the use of our Products and Services, End Users, and Customer’s Content, and must make sure all End Users fulfill their duties hereunder and that the terms in each End User’s Agreement are in accordance with this Agreement. In case Customer becomes aware of any breach of duties hereunder by an End User, Customer must immediately terminate said user’s access to Customer’s Content and our Products and Services.\n\n## 3. Notices\n\n3.1. Azion will notify you by: (a) posting a notice to the Azion Real Time Manager; or (b) sending a message to the e-mail addresses then associated to Customer’s account. Notices posted to Azion’s website or the Azion Real Time Manager will take effect when they are posted online, and notices sent via e-mail will take effect when our e-mail is sent, regardless of whether Customer has actually received them or not. Customer is required to keep a working e-mail address to receive notices.\n\n3.2 Any notices Customer needs to provide Azion regarding any and all issues deriving from this Agreement will be sent in writing and deemed delivered upon acknowledgment of receipt in person, via an express delivery service, a letter sent against receipt or registered mail to Azion at the address first given above. Notices delivered in person will take effect immediately. Notices sent via an express delivery service will take effect on the business day immediately following their delivery. Notices sent via a letter sent against receipt or registered mail will take effect 3 (three) business days after their delivery.\n\n## 4. Changes\n\n4.1. Except as otherwise provided for, Azion may change the terms and conditions of this Agreement or any other documents attached hereto, such as the Service Level Agreement, Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policies, at any time by posting a revised version on the Azion website and notifying Customer according to Section 3 above. The revised documents will take effect 30 days from being posted and, by continuing to use Azion’s Products and Services after said timeframe, Customer agrees to the new terms and conditions.\n\n4.2 Azion may change or discontinue any Products or Services, in addition to changing or removing characteristics and features, including those related to APIs. Azion will use reasonable commercial efforts to keep on providing support to the previous version except when (a) a security or intellectual property issue is raised; (b) doing so becomes economically or technically cumbersome, or (c) we are required to stop in order to comply with the law or government orders. Azion will notify Customer about any discontinuance of Products and Services purchased and substantial changes that may negatively impact Customer.\n\n## 5. Temporary Suspension\n\n5.1. Azion may immediately suspend Customer’s or any End User’s right to access or use any portion or all of the Products and Services upon notice in case:\n\n(a) The use or purchase of our Products and Services by Customer or End User (i) poses a security risk to our Products and Services or any third parties; (ii) comes to damage any other Azion Customers’ Products and Services, systems or Content; (iii) creates a liability on the part of Azion, our affiliates or any third parties; (iv) fails to comply with documents and good practices suggested by Azion, or (v) may be fraudulent;\n\n(b) Customer or any End User has violated this Agreement, including in the event Customer has provided misleading information regarding Customer’s registration data or about the ownership of Customer Content copyright;\n\n(c) Customer is behind on payments owed by Customer, including occasional costs for excess use, for over 5 (five) days; or\n\n(d) Customer fails to operate in Customer’s regular course, makes an assignment to the benefit of creditors or a similar disposal of Customer’s assets, or has become subject to bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or a similar procedure.\n\n5.2. In the event Azion suspends Customer’s access rights, as well as Customer’s use or any portion or all of our Products and Services:\n\n(a) Suspension days will neither be discounted from nor made up for in future bills;\n\n(b) Customer will remain the sole party responsible for the amounts applicable hereto with respect to any Products and Services to which Customer continues to have access;\n\n(c) Azion will not delete any portion of Customer’s Content as a result of Customer’s suspension, save for any other reason described herein.\n\n5.3. Azion’s right to suspend Customer’s access or use, or the use by any End User, is additional to Azion’s right to terminate this Agreement under Section 6.\n\n## 6. Term and Termination\n\n6.1 This Agreement takes effect when Customer clicks on the “I agree” button or checkbox shown in this document or uses any of Azion’s Products and Services for the first time, and will remain in effect until it is terminated by either Party for any reason by (i) sending notice and (ii) closing Customer’s account for all services to which Azion provides an online account closing mechanism. This Agreement may also be terminated for cause at any time in the event of any non-performance or substantial breach hereof by the other Party, provided the breaching Party has failed to remedy the fault or material violation within the 30 (thirty) day timeframe the aggrieved Party will grant the breaching Party, via notice to be sent once the fault or material breach has been detected.\n\n6.2 Additionally, Azion may immediately terminate this Agreement without notice (a) for cause, in case anything Customer or any End User does or fails to do results in the suspension described in Section 6.1; (b) in case Azion’s relationship with a third-party supplier of software or other technologies used by Azion to provide our Products and Services ends or requires changes to the way we provide software or other technologies; (c) in case Azion believes the supply of our Products and Services may create a technical or economic encumbrance or substantial security risk for Azion; (d) to comply with the law or requirements from government agencies; or (e) in case the use of our Products and Services by Customer or any End User, or yet the supply of Products and Services by Azion to Customer or any End User, has become impracticable or unviable for any legal or regulatory reason.\n\n6.3 Upon the termination hereof: (i) all Customer’s rights agreed upon herein will be immediately extinguished, except as provided for in Section 6.4; (ii) Customer will remain liable for all amounts owed, including all those agreed upon in this Agreement or any documents attached hereto, in addition to overages and all fees and expenses incurred, including expenses incurred in the post-termination period; (iii) at Azion’s discretion, Customer will immediately return or destroy all Azion Contents held by Customer; and (iv) Sections 2.1, 6.3, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 will survive the termination hereof as applicable.\n\n6.4 Upon the termination hereof, except in case Azion discontinues Customer’s use of our Products and Services under either Section 6.1 or 6.2, (i) Azion will take no steps to block or remove Customer’s Content as a result of said termination; and (ii) Azion will allow Customer to retrieve Customer’s Content from our Products and Services only when Customer has paid all of the amounts owed hereunder.\n\n6.5 This Agreement’s terms will apply to any use of our Products and Services after the termination hereof, and Customer will pay the amounts owed as set forth in Section 7.\n\n## 7. Compensation and Adjustments\n\n7.1 Azion calculates and bills the amounts owed on a monthly basis but we may do billing more often in case we suspect Customer is fraudulent or a default risk. Customer will pay the owed amounts applicable to our Products and Services as described on the Azion website and using one of the payment options supported by Azion. All amounts owed by Customer hereunder will be paid to Azion without offsetting or counter charges, and with no deductions or withholding.\n\n7.2 The prices charged for any new Product, Service or new Product or Service feature will take effect when we post the updated prices on the Azion website, except when we expressly state otherwise in a notice. We may raise or add new fees and change the way we calculate and bill any existing Products and Services used by Customer. Azion may annually adjust prices upon sending you notice at least 30 days in advance, and may charge interest at the rate of 1.5% a month (or at the highest interest rate allowed by law, in case it is lower) on all amounts in arrears, until the date payment is made.\n\n## 8. Exclusive Rights\n\n8.1 To Azion, Customer holds all rights and ownership over Customer’s Content. Except as provided for in Section 8, Azion will have no rights to Customer’s Content or similar intellectual property rights. Customer authorizes the use, posting, transformation and alteration of Customer’s Content by Azion for the supply of Products and Services to Customer and any End User, or to comply with any requests by a regulatory or government agency (including subpoenas and court orders).\n\n8.2 Customer represents and warrants that (a) Customer holds all of the rights, ownership and control relative to Customer’s Content; (b) Customer holds all of the rights to Customer’s Content necessary to grant the rights mentioned herein; and (c) no Customer’s Content or End User’s use of Customer’s Content or our Products and Services will breach our Acceptable Use Policy.\n\n8.3 Neither Customer nor any End User may use our Products and Services in any way or for any purposes other than as expressly provided for in this Agreement. Neither Customer nor any End User may or attempt to (a) modify, alter, tamper with, fix or otherwise create services derived from any software included in our Products and Services (except when Customer is provided with a separate license expressly authorizing the creation of derivative services); (b) reverse engineer, take apart or decompile our Products and Services or use any other processes or procedures to obtain the source code of any software used in our Products and Services; (c) access or use our Products and Services in order to avoid incurring fees or exceed use rates, or (d) resell or sublicense our Products and Services. All licenses given to Customer hereunder are conditioned to Customer’s permanent performance of this Agreement, which will be immediately terminated in case Customer fails to comply with any terms or conditions hereof. While this Agreement remains in effect and after that, Customer will not, nor will Customer authorize, help or encourage any third party to, make any claims against us or any of our affiliates, customers, suppliers, business partners or licensors with respect to any patent violations or other violations of intellectual property rights over the Products and Services used. Customer is only allowed to use Azion brands according to the guidelines on the use of registered trademarks.\n\n8.4 In the event Customer makes any suggestions for Product and Service improvement, such as source code, features, handbooks, and others, all property rights on and control of said suggestions will be held by Azion, even when Customer has said such suggestions are confidential. Azion and our affiliates may use those suggestions unrestrictedly. Customer hereby irrevocably assigns all property rights on and control of Customer’s suggestions to Azion, and agrees to provide Azion with any assistance Azion may need in order to document, improve and uphold our rights over such suggestions.\n\n## 9. Confidentiality and Disclosure\n\n9.1. The parties agree that all information exchanged relative to this Agreement is to be deemed confidential. In the event any of the parties is court-ordered to disclose any confidential information, the party so ordered must promptly provide the other with written notice about that fact, as long as court records are not under seal, so that said other party may have time enough to file the applicable defense, seek provisional remedies, or pursue another proper course of action, as the case may be.\n\n9.2 Customer will take all reasonable steps to prevent the disclosure, dissemination or unauthorized use of Azion’s Confidential Information, including, at least, the same steps Customers would take to protect Customer’s similar confidential information.\n\n9.3 This non-disclosure commitment will remain in force for 5 (five) years following the termination hereof, and the confidentiality of any and all data or information obtained as a result of this Agreement must be protected. Azion will not be liable for any violations of data or information resulting from the acts of employees, agents or persons authorized by Customer, or for those deriving from third-party criminal or unlawful acts.\n\n9.4 Without Azion’s authorization, Customer will not release any notes to the press or make public announcements related to this Agreement or Customer’s use of our Products and Services. Customer will not misrepresent or embellish the relationship between Customer and Azion (including by stating or implying that Azion supports, sponsors, endorses or contributes to Customer or Customer’s commercial efforts). Additionally, Customer will not state or imply there is any relationship or affiliation between Azion and Customer or any other persons or entities, except when expressly authorized by Azion. Customer agrees Azion may show Customer’s brands in any and all types of media, even after the termination hereof, in materials including, albeit not limited to, customer portfolios and case studies.\n\n## 10. Indemnification\n\n10.1. Customer will defend, indemnify and exempt Azion, our affiliates and licensors and each one of our respective employees, directors, chief officers and representatives from any and all claims, damage, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) stemming from or related to any third-party claims regarding (a) Customer’s or any End User’s use of our Products and Services (including any activities through Customer’s Azion account and use by Customer’s employees and personnel); (b) Customer’s or any End User’s breach of this Agreement or violation of applicable laws; (c) Customer’s Content or combination of Customer’s Content and other applications, contents or processes, including any claims involving an alleged violation or misappropriation of third-party rights by Customer’s Content, or the use, development, design, production, ad or sale of Customer’s Content; or (d) a litigation between Customer and any End User. In case Azion or our affiliates are forced to respond to third-party summons or another court order or lawsuit, Customer will also reimburse Azion for the attorneys’ fees paid, as well as for the time and materials used by Azion’s employees and contractors to respond to a third-party summons or said court order or lawsuit, based on the rates then charged per hour.\n\n10.2 Azion will promptly notify Customer about any claim as mentioned in Section 10.1. Azion’s failure to immediately notify Customer will only impact Customer’s duties under Section 10.1, considering Azion’s omission impairs Customer’s ability to defend the claim. Customer may (a) retain the attorney of Customer’s choice (subject to Azion’s written consent) to defend any claims; and (b) settle the claim as Customer deems appropriate, as long as Customer has obtained prior written consent from Azion between entering into any such agreement. Azion may also take over control over the claim’s defense and settlement at any time.\n\n## 11. Disclaimer\n\n11.1. Azion and our affiliates make no representations or warranties whatsoever, whether expressed, implied, legal or otherwise as to our Products and Services or Customer’s Content, including to the effect that our Products and Services or Third-Party Contents will be uninterrupted, error-free or free from harmful components, or that any Contents, including Customer’s Content or Third-Party Content, is safe and will not be lost or damaged. Except as barred by law, Azion, our affiliates and licensors disclaim any and all responsibility for warranties, including implied ones, regarding marketability, satisfactory quality, suitability for a given purpose, non-violation or peaceable use and any warranties deriving from any business practices or previously established use.\n\n## 12. Limitation of Liability\n\n12.1. Azion and our affiliates and licensors will not be liable to Customer for any direct, indirect, emerging, special, or unforeseen damage or exemplary pecuniary penalty (including damages for loss of profit, goodwill, use or data), even when one of the Parties had been notified about the possibility of such losses. Furthermore, neither Azion nor any of our affiliates or licensors will be liable for compensation, reimbursements or damages stemming from (a) Customer’s inability to use our Products and Services, including as a result of any (i) termination or suspension of this agreement or Customer’s use of or access to our Products and Services; (ii) Azion’s discontinuance or any or all of our Products and Services; or, (iii) without limitation to any duties under the SLA, any unforeseen or unscheduled downtime of all or a portion of our Products and Services for any reason, including as a result of a power outage, system failures or other interruptions; (b) costs to purchase substitute assets or services; (c) Customer’s investments, expenditures or commitments regarding this Agreement or Customer’s use of or access to our Products and Services; or (d) any unauthorized access, alteration or elimination, destruction, damage, loss or failure regarding the storage of Customer’s Content or other data. In any event, the total liability on the part of Azion and our affiliates and licensors is limited to the amount actually paid by Customer hereunder and for the service which has led to the claim over the 12 (twelve) months prior to said claim.\n\n## 13. Miscellaneous Provisions\n\n13.1. Azion will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide our services according to the SLA and notify Customer up to 10 (ten) days in advance about interruptions needed for technical adjustments or maintenance to our Products and Services. This information duty does not apply to emergency cases, meaning those which may jeopardize the regular operation of our Products and Services or the safety of our entire customer base against detected vulnerabilities.\n\n13.2 To clarify possible doubts about technical terms used on the internet and which may be relevant for the interpretation of this Agreement or our Products and Services, the definitions contained in the glossary herein, Azion’s website or issued by NIST (***National Institute of Standards and Technology, U.S. Department of Commerce\\***).\n\n13.3. This Agreement sets forth the parties’ full understanding relative to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, whether written or verbal, between the parties relative to the subject of the provisions herein.\n\n13.4 Customer’s Agreement and any documents attached thereto are complementary. However, in the event of a conflict between them, the provisions in the attached document will prevail. Similarly, in case a supplementary document is added and the documents clash, the latest attached document will prevail.\n\n13.5 Azion and Customer are independent parties and none of the parties or any of their respective affiliates represents the other party in any way or has powers to bind said other party. For their products, both parties reserve the right to (a) develop or commission the development of services, concepts, systems or techniques which are similar to or complete the products, services, concepts or techniques developed or provided by the other party; and (b) help third-party developers or system integrators that may offer Products and Services competing against the other party’s Products and Services.\n\n13.6 Customer may not assign this Agreement, nor delegate or sublicense any of Customer’s rights hereunder without Azion’s prior written consent. Any assignment or transfer in violation of this Section will be null. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be for the benefit of and binding upon the parties and their respective successors and assigns.\n\n13.7 This Agreement does not create any third-party rights for any individuals or entities other than the parties hereto.\n\n13.8 Azion and our affiliates will not be liable for any delays or failures to fulfill any duties agreed upon herein when such delays or failures derive from force majeure beyond our reasonable control, including misfortunes, employment claims or other disruptions to facilities, electricity grid, telecommunications or other public service failures, earthquakes, storms or other natural disasters, blockages, embargos, mutinies, government acts or orders, terrorist attacks or war.\n\n13.9 Azion’s failure to enforce any provision hereof will in no way be construed to be a present or future waiver of such provision, nor in any way affect Azion’s right to enforce each and every such provision thereafter. All waivers on our part must be in writing to be valid.\n\n13.10 In case any portion of this Agreement is deemed not valid or unfeasible, the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. Any portions deemed not valid or unfeasible will be construed according to the effect and intention of the original portion. In case such construction is not possible, the portions deemed not valid or unfeasible will be excluded from this Agreement and the remainder hereof will remain in full force and effect.\n\n13.11 The parties hereby state they have freely entered into this Agreement, which has been drawn up in strict compliance with the boundaries of its economic or social purpose, good faith and proper practice. The parties further state they are not in a state of duress and have ample experience enabling them to fulfill all of the terms and conditions which make up their rights and duties hereunder.\n\n13.12 Customer agrees that upon accepting the services purchased and paying for them Customer will become legally bound by the terms set forth in this Agreement and under no circumstances whatsoever may Customer allege Customer’s representatives or charter documents lack the power or other formalities to do so.\n\n13.13 Any disputes or claims in any way related to Customer’s use of our Products and Services will be resolved in a binding manner via arbitration instead of being heard by the courts, except when Customer is allowed to submit Customer’s claims to the small claims courts in case said claims meet the applicable requirements. There are no judges or jury in arbitration procedures, and there is limited review of arbitration decisions by the courts. However, an arbitrator may individually issue decisions about the same damages and remedies subject to court decisions (including provisional remedies, declarations or statutory damages), and must keep to the terms of this Agreement the same way a court would. To initiate an arbitration procedure, Customer must send an e-mail requesting the arbitration and describing Customer's claim to our legal department at legal@azion.com. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") under its rules, which are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Filing, administrative and arbitrators’ fees will be governed by AAA’ rules and paid by the defeated party. The Parties agree that any dispute resolution procedures will be individually conducted instead of via class actions and consolidated or representative lawsuits. In case for any reason a claim is to be submitted to a judge or court instead of to arbitration, Azion and Customer agree to waive any rights to a judgment by the courts of law. According to the provisions in Section 8.4, the parties agree they may submit to the tribunal a case to establish whether there has been a violation or any undue use of intellectual property rights, as well as to enforce payment and collect any amounts owed under this Agreement.\n\n13.14 This Agreement shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws thereof, or principles of conflicts of laws of any other jurisdiction which could cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.\n\n## 14.

As credenciais de log-in na Azion são apenas para uso interno, sendo que o Cliente não poderá vendê-las, transferi-las ou sublicenciá-las a qualquer outra entidade ou pessoa, exceto cadastrar uma conta Azion aos seus representantes e subcontratados que trabalham em nome do Cliente. \n\n2.6. O Cliente será o único responsável pelo uso dos Produtos e Serviços, pelos Usuários Finais e pelo Seu Conteúdo, devendo assegurar que todos os Usuários Finais observem suas obrigações nos termos do presente Contrato e que os termos do Contrato com cada Usuário Final sejam condizentes com este Contrato. Caso o Cliente tome conhecimento de qualquer violação de suas obrigações, nos termos deste Contrato, por um Usuário Final, deverá encerrar imediatamente o acesso desse usuário ao Seu Conteúdo, Produtos e Serviços. \n\n## 3. Avisos\n\n3.1. A Azion deve fornecer-lhe aviso: (a) postando um aviso no Azion Real Time Manager; ou (b) enviando uma mensagem aos endereços de e-mail então associados a conta do Cliente. Os avisos postados no Site da Azion ou Azion Real Time Manager vigorarão quando da sua publicação online, sendo que os avisos enviados por e-mail vigorarão quando enviarmos o e-mail, independentemente do Cliente tê-lo realmente recebido ou não, sendo responsabilidade do Cliente manter um endereço de e-mail funcional para recepção dos comunicados. \n\n3.2. Qualquer notificação que o Cliente precisar fazer à Azion, para tudo o que seja decorrente do presente Contrato, se formalizará por escrito e será considerado entregue com a confirmação de recebimento em mãos, por serviço de entrega expressa, carta protocolada ou carta registrada para Azion, para o endereço que consta no início deste Contrato. Os avisos enviados em mãos entrarão em vigor imediatamente. Os avisos enviados por serviço de entrega expressa entrarão em vigor 1 (um) dia útil após a entrega. Os avisos por carta protocolada ou carta registrada entrarão em vigor 3 (três) dias úteis após a entrega. \n\n## 4. Alterações\n\n4.1. Salvo quando definido em contrário, a Azion poderá alterar os termos e condições deste Contrato ou de quaisquer documentos anexos a ele, como por exemplo Ordem de Serviço, Acordo de Nível de Serviço e Políticas de Uso Aceitável, a qualquer tempo, publicando uma versão revisada no site da Azion e notificando-o de acordo com a Cláusula 3 do presente Contrato. Os documentos modificados entrarão em vigor 30 dias após serem publicados e, ao continuar utilizando os Produtos e Serviços da Azion após esse período, o Cliente concorda com os novos termos e condições. \n\n4.2. A Azion poderá alterar ou encerrar quaisquer Produtos ou Serviços, além de alterar ou remover características ou funcionalidades, inclusive de APIs. A Azion empreenderá esforços comerciais razoáveis para continuar a dar suporte à versão anterior salvo se (a) uma questão de segurança ou propriedade intelectual venha a ser apresentada; (b) haja onerosidade econômica ou técnica, ou (c) seja necessário, para observar as leis ou solicitações de entidades governamentais. A Azion o notificará de qualquer encerramento de Produtos ou Serviços contratados e de mudanças substanciais que gerem impacto negativo ao Cliente. \n\n## 5. Suspensão Temporária\n\n5.1. A Azion poderá suspender o seu direito ou o direito de qualquer Usuário Final de acesso ou uso de quaisquer parcelas ou de todos os Produtos e Serviços imediatamente, mediante aviso, se: \n\n(a) O uso ou contratação dos Produtos e Serviços pelo Cliente ou Usuário Final (i) representa um risco de segurança aos Produtos e Serviços ou a qualquer terceiro; (ii) venha prejudicar os Produtos e Serviços, os sistemas ou o Conteúdo de qualquer outro cliente Azion; (iii) venha acarretar responsabilidade por parte da Azion, das suas afiliadas e de quaisquer terceiros; (iv) não esteja de acordo com as documentações e boas práticas sugeridas pela Azion, ou (v) possa ser fraudulento; \n\n(b) O Cliente ou qualquer Usuário Final violou o presente Contrato, inclusive se o Cliente faltou com a verdade em relação as informações cadastrais ou a respeito da titularidade de direito autoral sobre os Seus Conteúdos; \n\n(c) O Cliente estiver em atraso com suas obrigações de pagamento, incluindo os eventuais custos por utilização excedente, por mais de 5 (cinco) dias; ou       \n\n(d) O Cliente deixar de operar no curso regular, efetuar uma cessão em benefício de credores ou alienação similar dos seus ativos, ou ficou sujeito à falência, recuperação, liquidação, dissolução ou procedimento similar. \n\n5.2. Se a Azion suspender os direitos de acesso do Cliente, bem como o uso de qualquer parcela ou de todos os Produtos e Serviços: \n\n(a) Os dias de suspensão não serão descontados e nem compensados em cobranças futuras; \n\n(b) O Cliente permanecerá sendo o único responsável pelo(s) valores aplicáveis ao Contrato, com relação a quaisquer Produtos e Serviços aos quais continua a ter acesso; \n\n(c) A Azion não apagará qualquer parte do Seu Conteúdo, como resultado da sua suspensão, salvo se especificado em qualquer outra parte deste Contrato. \n\n5.3. O direito da Azion de suspender o acesso ou uso do Cliente ou uso de qualquer Usuário Final é adicional ao direito de rescindir este Contrato nos termos da Cláusula 6. \n\n## 6. Vigência e Rescisão\n\n6.1. O presente Contrato entrará em vigor quando o Cliente utilizar ou realizar acesso a quaisquer dos Produtos e Serviços Azion pela primeira vez e poderá ser rescindido por qualquer das Partes, por qualquer motivo: (i) enviando aviso prévio e (ii) encerrando a conta do Cliente para todos os serviços para os quais a Azion fornece um mecanismo de encerramento de conta online. Este Contrato também poderá ainda ser rescindido por justa causa, à qualquer momento, se houver qualquer inadimplemento ou violação substancial deste Contrato pela outra Parte, e desde que a Parte inadimplente não tenha sanado a falha ou a violação material dentro do prazo de 30 (trinta) dias que lhe será concedido pela Parte prejudicada, mediante aviso prévio a ser enviado quando da identificação da falha ou descumprimento material. \n\n6.2. A Azion também poderá rescindir este Contrato imediatamente, sem necessidade de aviso prévio (a) por justa causa, se qualquer ato ou omissão praticada pelo Cliente ou por qualquer Usuário Final resultar na suspensão descrita na Cláusula 6.1; (b) se o relacionamento da Azion com um terceiro parceiro, que fornece o software ou outra tecnologia que é utilizada pela Azion para fornecer os Produtos e Serviços findar, terminar ou exigir que seja alterada a forma que fornecemos o software ou outra tecnologia; (c) se a Azion acreditar que o fornecimento dos Produtos e Serviços poderá criar um ônus técnico ou econômico ou risco de segurança substancial para a Azion; (d) para observar a lei ou exigências de entidades governamentais; ou (e) se o uso dos Produtos e Serviços pelo Cliente ou qualquer Usuário Final ou ainda se a prestação de quaisquer dos Produtos e Serviços pela Azion ao Cliente ou a qualquer Usuário Final se tornou impraticável ou inviável por qualquer razão legal ou regulamentar. \n\n6.3. Mediante a rescisão deste Contrato: (i) todos os direitos do Cliente aqui pactuados serão extintos imediatamente; (ii) o Cliente permanece sendo o responsável por todos os haveres, incluindo todos os valores contratados como Preço *On Demand* e Preço por Capacidade Reservada, além de excedentes e todas as taxas e despesas incorridas; (iii) o Cliente devolverá imediatamente ou, destruirá todo o Conteúdo Azion em sua posse, à critério da Azion; e (iv) as Cláusulas 2.1, 6.3, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 continuarão aplicáveis de acordo com seus termos. \n\n6.4. Salvo se a Azion encerrar o uso dos Produtos e Serviços para o Cliente, nos termos da Cláusula 6.2, durante os 10 (dez) dias subsequentes à rescisão: (i) a Azion não apagará quaisquer dos Seus Conteúdos como resultado da rescisão; (ii) o Cliente poderá recuperar Seu Conteúdo somente se tiver quitado quaisquer haveres, taxas e despesas de uso pós-rescisão e de todos os outros valores devidos; e (iii) a Azion fornecerá a mesma assistência de migração pós-rescisão que coloca a disposição dos clientes. \n\n6.5. Deixando de vigorar o presente Contrato, todos os serviços serão automaticamente interrompidos de forma definitiva, de modo que o Cliente e seus usuários perderão o acesso. \n\n## 7. Remuneração e Reajuste\n\n7.1. O Cliente poderá escolher preços e condições de pagamento *On Demand* (“*Preço On Demand*”) ou por Capacidade Reservada (“Preço por Capacidade Reservada”), e pagará à Azion os valores definidos na Ordem de Serviço, sem compensação ou reconvenção, e sem qualquer dedução ou retenção. Para contratar os Produtos e Serviços utilizando o Preço por Capacidade Reservada, o Cliente deverá definir os produtos, serviços, prazo e a quantidade de capacidade reservada desejada na Ordem de Serviço. \n\n7.2. O Preço *On Demand* ou Preço por Capacidade Reservada poderão ser corrigidos anualmente pelo IGP-DI/FGV, e poderão ser revistos a qualquer tempo desde que o Cliente seja comunicado com 60 (sessenta) dias de antecedência. Caso isso ocorra, o Cliente poderá: (a) rescindir o Contrato, e receber um reembolso pro rata die pago pelo Preço *On Demand* ou Preço por Capacidade Reservada, notificando a Azion sobre o interesse em rescindir em até 30 (trinta) dias após o recebimento da comunicação mencionada acima, de acordo com a Cláusula 7 do Contrato; ou (b) solicitar a alteração à Azion dos Produtos e Serviços ou sua quantidade contratada na Ordem de Serviço. A menos que a Azion receba um aviso de rescisão por escrito, nos termos da Cláusula 3.2 deste Contrato, o ajuste de preços entrará em vigor conforme notificação e o Contrato ou Ordem de Serviço, posteriormente, só poderão ser cancelados em conformidade com os termos deste Contrato. \n\n7.3. Os serviços prestados, para efeito de cobrança, constituem-se em um todo indivisível, de modo que não se admitirão pagamentos parciais. Em razão disso, o pagamento do Preço *On Demand* ou do Preço por Capacidade Reservada deve ser integral. Caso o pagamento não seja integral, o Cliente estará sujeito às consequências do inadimplemento. A Azion poderá cobrar juros a taxa de 1% por mês (ou a maior taxa de juros permitida por lei, caso inferior) sobre todos os valores em atraso, e correção monetária de acordo com o índice IGP-M/FGV até a data do efetivo pagamento. \n\n7.4. Mediante o término do prazo da Capacidade Reservada, o Preço por Capacidade Reservada expirará e o Preço On Demand, baseados no uso sob demanda, será aplicável. Além de estarem sujeitos ao Preço por Capacidade Reservada, os Produtos e Serviços estão sujeitos a todas as taxas de uso excedente e outras taxas aplicáveis nos termos do Contrato.       \n\n## 8. Direitos Exclusivos\n\n8.1. Para a Azion, o Cliente detém todos os direitos e a propriedade do Seu Conteúdo. Salvo se previsto na Cláusula 8, a Azion não terá nenhum direito ao Seu Conteúdo, nem qualquer direito de propriedade intelectual correlato. O Cliente autoriza o uso, publicação, transformação e alteração do Seu Conteúdo pela Azion para fornecimento dos Produtos e Serviços ao Cliente e qualquer Usuário Final, ou para atender qualquer solicitação de um órgão regulador ou governamental (inclusive intimações ou ordens judiciais). \n\n8.2. O Cliente declara e garante que: (a) detém todos os direitos, a propriedade e participação no Seu Conteúdo; (b) detém todos os direitos ao Seu Conteúdo, necessários à concessão dos direitos aqui contemplados; e (c) nenhum dos Seus Conteúdos ou uso pelos Usuários Finais do Seu Conteúdo ou dos Produtos e Serviços violará a Política de Uso Aceitável. \n\n8.3. Nem o Cliente nem qualquer Usuário Final poderão utilizar os Produtos e Serviços de qualquer modo ou para qualquer fim, senão da forma expressamente permitida por este Contrato. Nem o Cliente nem qualquer Usuário Final poderão ou tentarão (a) modificar, alterar, adulterar, consertar ou de outro modo criar serviços derivados de qualquer software incluso nos Produtos e Serviços (salvo quando seja fornecido ao Cliente uma licença separada que expressamente permita a criação de serviços derivados); (b) reverter a engenharia, desmontar ou decompilar os Produtos e Serviços ou aplicar qualquer outro processo ou procedimento para obter o código-fonte de qualquer software utilizado nos Produtos e Serviços; (c) acessar ou utilizar os Produtos e Serviços com o intuito de evitar incorrer em taxas ou exceder as quotas limites de uso, ou (d) revender ou sublicenciar os Produtos e Serviços. Todas as licenças concedidas ao Cliente neste Contrato estão condicionadas à sua observância permanente, e será imediatamente rescindido se o Cliente não observar qualquer termo ou condição aqui estabelecida. Durante a Vigência e depois dela, o Cliente não fará, nem autorizará, auxiliará ou encorajará qualquer terceiro a fazer uma reivindicação contra nós ou quaisquer de nossas afiliadas, clientes, fornecedores, parceiros comerciais ou licenciantes, relativamente a qualquer violação de patente ou outra violação de propriedade intelectual dos Produtos e Serviços utilizadas. O Cliente somente poderá utilizar as marcas Azion de acordo com as diretrizes de uso de marcas registradas. \n\n8.4. Mesmo que o Cliente forneça quaisquer sugestões de melhoria sobre Produtos e Serviços, tais como código fonte, funcionalidade, manuais, dentre outros, todos os direitos de propriedade e da participação sobre as sugestões serão da Azion, mesmo se o Cliente tenha designado que as sugestões são confidenciais. A Azion e suas afiliadas poderão utilizar as sugestões sem restrições. O Cliente neste ato, de forma irrevogável, cede para Azion todos os direitos de propriedade e participação sobre as sugestões, concordando em fornecer à Azion qualquer assistência que esta possa exigir para documentar, aperfeiçoar e manter seus direitos sobre as sugestões. \n\n## 9. Confidencialidade e Publicidade\n\n9.1. As partes acordam que todas as informações trocadas no âmbito deste Contrato devem ser consideradas confidenciais. Caso qualquer das partes seja judicialmente obrigada a divulgar qualquer informação confidencial, a parte obrigada deverá prontamente enviar à outra parte notificação escrita a esse respeito, desde que não esteja sob sigilo judicial, de forma que essa tenha tempo hábil para, quando for o caso, propor a defesa cabível, a medida cautelar ou outro recurso apropriado. \n\n9.2. O Cliente tomará todas as medidas razoáveis para impedir a divulgação, disseminação ou uso não autorizado das Informações Confidenciais da Azion, incluindo, no mínimo, aquelas medidas que tomaria para proteger as suas próprias informações confidenciais de natura semelhante. \n\n9.3. O compromisso de confidencialidade perdurará por 5 (cinco) anos após o término deste Contrato, devendo ser mantido o sigilo sobre quaisquer dados ou informações obtidas em decorrência deste Contrato. A Azion não será responsável por qualquer violação de dados e informações resultante de atos de funcionários, prepostos ou de pessoas autorizados pelo Cliente, nem daquelas decorrentes de ação criminosa ou irregular de terceiros. \n\n9.4. O Cliente não emitirá qualquer nota à imprensa ou efetuará comunicado público relativamente ao presente Contrato ou seu uso dos Produtos e Serviços sem autorização da Azion. O Cliente não deturpará nem enlevará o relacionamento entre o Cliente e a Azion (inclusive expressando ou deixando implícito que a Azion apoia, patrocina, afiança ou contribuí com o Cliente ou com seus esforços comerciais), tampouco expressará ou deixará implícito qualquer relacionamento ou filiação entre o Cliente e a Azion ou qualquer outra pessoa ou entidade, salvo se expressamente autorizado pela Azion. O Cliente concorda que a Azion veicule sua(s) marca(s) em quaisquer tipos de mídia, mesmo ao término de vigência do Contrato, em materiais como, mas não restritos, a portfólio de clientes e estudos de caso. \n\n## 10. Indenização\n\n10.1. O Cliente defenderá, indenizará e isentará a Azion, suas afiliadas e licenciantes e cada um dos seus respectivos empregados, administradores, diretores e representantes de todas e quaisquer demandas, danos, perdas, responsabilidades, custas e despesas (inclusive honorários advocatícios razoáveis) oriundas ou relacionadas a qualquer demanda de terceiro no tocante: (a) ao uso pelo Cliente ou qualquer Usuário Final dos Produtos e Serviços (inclusive quaisquer atividades sob a conta Azion e uso pelos empregados e pessoal do Cliente); (b) à violação deste Contrato ou violação das leis aplicáveis pelo Cliente ou qualquer Usuário Final; (c) ao Seu Conteúdo ou combinação do Seu Conteúdo com outras aplicações, conteúdo e processos, inclusive qualquer demanda envolvendo suposta violação ou apropriação indébita de direitos de terceiros pelo Seu Conteúdo, ou pelo uso, desenvolvimento, desenho, produção, anúncio ou comercialização do Seu Conteúdo; ou (d) a um litígio entre o Cliente e qualquer Usuário Final. Se a Azion ou suas afiliadas forem obrigadas a responder à intimação de terceiros ou a outra ordem ou processo judicial, o Cliente também reembolsará a Azion pelos honorários advocatícios gastos, bem como pelo tempo e material gasto pelos empregados e contratados da Azion na resposta da intimação de terceiro ou da ordem ou processo judicial com base na remuneração então vigente por hora. \n\n10.2. A Azion notificará o Cliente prontamente sobre qualquer demanda consoante a Cláusula 10.1. A não notificação imediata por parte da Azion somente afetará as obrigações do Cliente nos termos da Cláusula 10.1, na medida em que a omissão da Azion prejudica a capacidade do Cliente em se defender da demanda. O Cliente poderá: (a) utilizar um advogado de sua escolha (sujeito ao consentimento por escrito da Azion) na defesa de qualquer demanda; e (b) dirimir a demanda conforme considere apropriado, contanto que obtenha o consentimento prévio e por escrito da Azion antes de celebrar qualquer acordo. A Azion também poderá assumir o controle da defesa e da composição da demanda a qualquer tempo. \n\n## 11. Isenção de Responsabilidade\n\n11.1. A Azion e suas afiliadas não prestam qualquer declaração ou garantia de qualquer natureza, expressa, implícita, legal ou de outro modo, relativa aos Produtos e Serviços ou ao Conteúdo de Cliente, inclusive que os Produtos e Serviços ou Conteúdo de Terceiros serão ininterruptos, livres de erro ou livres de componentes danosos, ou que qualquer Conteúdo, inclusive o Seu Conteúdo ou Conteúdo de Terceiro, estará seguro e não será de perdido ou danificado. Salvo se proibido por lei, a Azion, suas afiliadas e licenciantes se eximem de todas as responsabilidades com relação a garantias, inclusive implícitas de comercialidade, qualidade satisfatória, adequação a um fim específico, não violação ou uso pacífico e quaisquer garantias advindas de qualquer prática comercial ou uso previamente estabelecido. \n\n## 12. Limitação de Responsabilidade\n\n12.1. A Azion e suas afiliadas ou licenciantes não serão responsáveis perante o Cliente com relação a qualquer dano direto, indireto, emergente, especial, imprevisto ou multa exemplar (inclusive danos por lucros cessantes, fundo de comércio, uso ou dados), mesmo se uma Parte tiver sido informada sobre a possibilidade de tais danos. Ademais, nem a Azion nem quaisquer de suas afiliadas ou licenciantes serão responsáveis por indenizações, reembolsos ou danos oriundos com relação: (a) a incapacidade do Cliente em utilizar os Produtos e Serviços, inclusive como resultado de qualquer (i) rescisão ou suspensão do presente contrato ou do seu uso ou acesso aos Produtos e Serviços; (ii) o encerramento pela Azion de quaisquer ou de todos os Produtos e Serviços; ou, (iii) sem limitar qualquer obrigação nos termos do Acordo de Nível de Serviço, qualquer tempo inoperante não previsto ou programado de todos ou de uma parcela dos Produtos e Serviços por qualquer motivo, inclusive como resultado de falta de energia elétrica, falhas de sistema ou outras interrupções; (b) aos custos da contratação de bens ou serviços substitutos; (c) aos investimentos, gastos ou compromissos de sua parte no tocante ao presente Contrato ou a seu uso ou acesso aos Produtos e Serviços; ou (d) a qualquer acesso desautorizado, alteração ou eliminação, destruição, dano, perda ou falha no armazenamento do Seu Conteúdo ou outros dados. Em qualquer hipótese, a responsabilidade total da parte da Azion e de suas afiliadas e licenciantes estará limitada ao valor efetivamente pago pelo Cliente nos termos deste Contrato e pelo serviço que ensejou a demanda durante os 12 (doze) meses anteriores à demanda. \n\n## 13. Disposições Gerais\n\n13.1. A Azion empenhará esforços comercialmente razoáveis para disponibilizar seus serviços de acordo com o Acordo de Nível de Serviço, e informará, com até 10 (dez) dias de antecedência, sobre interrupções necessárias para ajustes técnicos ou manutenção dos Produtos e Serviços. O dever de informação não se aplica a casos de urgência, assim entendidos aqueles que coloquem em risco o regular funcionamento dos Produtos e Serviços ou a segurança da totalidade dos clientes contra vulnerabilidades detectadas. \n\n13.2. Para o esclarecimento de possíveis dúvidas em relação à terminologia técnica utilizada na internet e que possa ser relevante para a interpretação do presente Contrato ou Produtos e Serviços, prevalecerão as definições constantes no glossário do presente Contrato, no site da Azion ou no NIST (***National Institute of Standards and Technology, U.S. Department of Commerce***). \n\n13.3. O serviço de suporte, caso seja de interesse do Cliente, deverá ser contratado por meio de uma Ordem de Serviço.       \n\n13.4. Este Contrato representa a totalidade dos entendimentos das partes em relação aos assuntos aqui tratados, substituindo todos os acordos prévios, verbais ou escritos, feitos entre as partes em relação ao objeto das disposições do presente instrumento. \n\n13.5. A Ordem de Serviço e o Contrato de Cliente são complementares, no entanto, em caso de divergência entre o Contrato de Cliente e a Ordem de Serviço, prevelecerá o disposto na Ordem de Serviço, bem como no caso de uma Ordem de Serviço suplementar ser acrescentada e as mesmas conflitarem, a Ordem de Serviço mais recente prevalecerá. \n\n13.6. A Azion e o Cliente são partes independentes e nenhuma das partes, nem quaisquer respectivas afiliadas, são representantes da outra parte para quaisquer fins ou têm poderes para vincular a outra parte. Ambas as partes se reservam o direito (a) de desenvolver ou fazer com que sejam desenvolvidos para seus produtos, serviços, conceitos, sistemas ou técnicas que sejam similares ou completem os produtos, serviços, conceitos, sistemas ou técnicas desenvolvidas ou contempladas pela outra parte; e (b) de auxiliar desenvolvedores terceiros ou integradores de sistemas, que podem ofertar produtos ou serviços que concorram com os produtos ou serviços da outra parte. \n\n13.7. O Cliente não poderá ceder o presente Contrato, nem delegar ou sublicenciar quaisquer de seus direitos aqui estabelecidos, sem o consentimento prévio e por escrito da Azion. Qualquer cessão ou transferência em violação a esta Cláusula será nula. Sujeito ao acima exposto, este Contrato vinculará as partes, sendo revertido em benefício delas e de seus respectivos sucessores e cessionários. \n\n13.8. O presente Contrato não cria qualquer direito de beneficiários terceiros sobre qualquer pessoa física ou entidade que não seja parte do presente Contrato. \n\n13.9. A Azion e suas afiliadas não se responsabilizarão por qualquer atraso ou descumprimento de qualquer obrigação aqui pactuada, quando o atraso ou descumprimento advir de força maior, além do nosso controle razoável, inclusive casos fortuitos, ações trabalhistas ou outras perturbações industriais, em sistema elétrico, nas telecomunicações, ou outras falhas em serviços públicos, terremotos, tempestades ou outros elementos da natureza, bloqueios, embargos, motins, atos ou ordens governamentais, atos de terrorismos ou guerra. \n\n13.10. O não cumprimento por parte da Azion de qualquer disposição do presente Contrato não constituirá uma renúncia atual ou futura de tal disposição, nem limitará o direito da Azion de fazer valer tal disposição posteriormente. Todas as renúncias de nossa parte deverão ser por escrito para terem eficácia. \n\n13.11. Se qualquer parte deste Contrato for considerada inválida ou inexequível, as partes remanescentes permanecerão em pleno vigor e efeito. Quaisquer partes inválidas ou inexequíveis serão interpretadas de acordo com o efeito e a intenção da parte original. Se tal interpretação não for possível, a parte inválida ou inexequível será excluída do presente Contrato, mas o restante do Contrato permanecerá em pleno vigor e efeito. \n\n13.12. As partes declaram que tiveram ampla liberdade quanto à presente contratação, a qual foi feita em estrita observância aos limites do respectivo fim econômico ou social, pela boa-fé e pelos bons costumes, bem como declaram que não estão em situação de premente necessidade e têm ampla experiência para cumprir todas as cláusulas e condições que constituem seus direitos e obrigações constantes no presente Contrato. \n\n13.13. As Partes declaram, sob as penas da Lei, que os signatários do presente Instrumento são seu representantes legais, devidamente constituídos na forma dos respectivos Estatutos/Contratos Sociais, com poderes para assumir as obrigações ora pactuadas, não havendo qualquer limitação ou condicionante que possa comprometer a eficácia deste Contrato. \n\n13.14. Sem prejuízo do disposto acima, o Cliente atesta, ainda, que o aceite dos serviços contratados e o pagamento destes servirá, igualmente, como efetiva vinculação aos termos estabelecidos neste Contrato, não podendo esta alegar, em quaisquer hipóteses, a ausência de poderes de seus representantes ou de outras formalidades previstas em seus documentos societários. \n\n13.15. No caso de eventuais litígios relativos ao presente Contrato, as partes devem, primeiro, tentar solucionar o conflito por meio de boa-fé e mediação comercial, sem a necessidade de um processo formal. Entretanto, na hipótese de persistência do litígio, as partes elegem o foro de Porto Alegre/RS para a solução de qualquer conflito decorrente do presente Contrato, abdicando de qualquer outro, por mais privilegiado que seja. \n\n## 14.

Listings.** You may list Your Marketplace Content in the Azion Marketplace subject to the following terms:\n\n**3.1 Review of Listings.** You are responsible for evaluating and testing software in Your Marketplace Content before submitting it to Azion to confirm that it complies with this Agreement and our Policies and operates properly with the web services offered by Azion. In connection with the purposes contemplated under this Agreement, we may review and test Your Marketplace Content submitted for listing in Azion Marketplace at any time, including for security-related concerns and to check the accuracy of descriptions and other materials in Your Marketplace Content. We may accept or reject Your Marketplace Content (a) for legal, regulatory, fraud and abuse prevention, or security reasons; (b) to restrict products or activities that we deem unsafe, inappropriate, or offensive; or (c) if Your Marketplace Content otherwise violates the terms of this Agreement or our Policies. You will cooperate with our review and testing. For the avoidance of doubt, this section does not apply to services listed in Azion Experts.\n\n**3.2 Responsibility for Your Marketplace Content.** You are responsible for Your Marketplace Content. Subject to Section 3.6 of this Agreement, you will establish the pricing, license rights and other terms governing Azion Marketplace customers’ (**“Subscribers”**) use of Your Marketplace Content. If you do not specify license rights for Your Marketplace Content, then you agree to license Your Marketplace Content to Subscribers on the same terms that we license software offered by Azion to Subscribers. You will ensure that all information about Your Marketplace Content (including information about applicable fees) displayed on the Azion Site is, at all times, accurate, complete, not misleading, and in compliance with applicable law. Except as provided in this Agreement, Azion obtains no rights under this Agreement from you to Your Marketplace Content.\n\n**3.3 Representations and Warranties.** You represent and warrant that:\n\n(1) you have the lawful right to any of Your Marketplace Content that you promote, license, sell or grant access to Subscribers through Azion Marketplace, and the sale or license of Your Marketplace Content shall not be in violation of such rights or applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to, in the case of Data Products, (i) any requirements to provide notice to and/or obtain consent from the individual to whom the data relates and (ii) any restrictions or requirements that apply to cross-border transfers of such data; and\n\n(2) with respect to Data Products only, to the extent Your Marketplace Content contains any data that (i) identifies or can be used by a Subscriber or other third party to identify a natural person or (ii) otherwise may be deemed to be personal data or personal information under applicable laws or regulations, then such data:\n\n​\t(a) has already lawfully been made available to the general public, such as via governmental records, widely distributed media, or legally required public disclosures; and\n\n​\t(b) does not include sensitive data or sensitive information about an individual or shall not otherwise be deemed to be sensitive data or sensitive information under applicable laws and regulations, including information relating to biometric or genetic data, health, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex or sexual orientation, trade union membership, or personal payment or financial information (collectively, “**Sensitive Personal Data**”). For example, none of Your Marketplace Content may include (i) any consumer reports as defined in the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended (“**FCRA**”), (ii) nonpublic personal information as defined under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, as amended (“**GLBA**”), (iii) protected health information as defined under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended (“**HIPAA**”) that has not been de-identified in compliance with HIPAA, or (iv) special categories of personal data as defined in the General Data Protection Regulation, as amended (“**GDPR**”).\n\n**3.4 Maintenance and Removal of Your Marketplace Content.**\n\n(1) You will ensure that all software in Your Marketplace Content is up-to-date with current bug fixes and patches. You will ensure that all underlying content of your Data Products are up-to-date and free of viruses, worms, Trojan horses, disabling programming instructions or other such items that may threaten, infect, damage, disable or otherwise interfere with the permitted use of the respective product. If Azion determines that an update to the runtime environment used in Your Marketplace Content is necessary or desirable, we may, but do not need to, contact you to request that you update and resubmit Your Marketplace Content in accordance with Section 3.1. If we provide notice to you to update and resubmit Your Marketplace Content, and you fail to do so within the time specified in such notice, then Azion reserves the right to remove Your Marketplace Content from Azion Marketplace and (if applicable) cancel any underlying subscriptions to Your Marketplace Content that utilize any web services offered by Azion.\n\n(2) You may remove a listing of or offer for Your Marketplace Content from Azion Marketplace at any time in accordance with Azion Marketplace Listing Guidelines. We may also remove any listing or offer for Your Marketplace Content from Azion Marketplace at any time and in the case of Data Products, cancel any underlying subscriptions (i) for legal, regulatory, fraud and abuse prevention, or security reasons; (ii) to restrict products or activities that we deem unsafe, inappropriate, or offensive; or (iii) if Your Marketplace Content otherwise violates the terms of this Agreement or our Policies.\n\n(3) Any removal by you of any listing or offer of Your Marketplace Content from Azion Marketplace will apply to prospective Subscribers only and you will continue to enable current Subscribers to use Your Marketplace Content after removal of the listing or offer until that Subscriber terminates their use.\n\n**3.5 Our Role.** You will be the seller of record for Your Marketplace Content. We certify that we will not retain, use or disclose any underlying content of Your Marketplace Content for any purpose other than providing services to you in accordance with this Agreement. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, we are not involved in any underlying transaction between you and any Subscriber. We are not responsible for any dispute between you and any Subscriber, but we may elect to assist in resolving any dispute between you and any Subscriber. If we elect to assist in the resolution of a dispute, you agree to cooperate with us to resolve the dispute.\n\n**3.6 Fair Treatment of Our Subscribers.** If You offer Your Marketplace Content to Subscribers on terms and conditions (including but not limited to price) on less favorable to the same offering(s) on Similar Sales Channels and you fail to cure after being given 30 days notice, then we may terminate the Agreement for convenience. Examples of less favorable terms include (a) your total fees and charges for Your Marketplace Content exceed the lowest total fees and charges you offer through any Similar Sales Channels and (b) making available in Azion Marketplace some but not all of your software and data products (including all versions) that you make available through any Similar Sales Channel unless we choose to only sell some of your solutions.\n\n**3.7 Subscriber Ratings and Feedback.** We may implement mechanisms that rate, or allow Subscribers to rate and provide feedback about, Your Marketplace Content (including information about Your Marketplace Content that was removed from Azion Marketplace), you, and your performance in connection with Your Marketplace Content and Azion Marketplace or Azion Experts. We may make these ratings and feedback publicly available.\n\n**3.8 Technical Support and Subscriber Service.** You are solely responsible for technical support (if any) for Your Marketplace Content. You must make Subscriber support (i.e., non-technical) contact details available for each of your Data Products. To be clear, this section does not create an obligation that you provide technical support for Your Marketplace Content, but we need not provide Subscriber support or technical support to any Subscriber of Your Marketplace Content.\n\n**3.9 Subscriber Information.** Except as expressly set forth in this Section 3.9 or as otherwise expressly permitted by us, you may use Subscriber Information only (i) to communicate with Subscribers who acquire rights to Your Marketplace Content (x) to provide customer training and technical support and (y) for software or data subscription activation, configuration and customization of content delivered via a software-as-a-service model; (ii) for computation of your internal sales metrics; or (iii) for compliance verification purposes related to Subscribers seeking to acquire rights to the underlying content of your Data Products. You may not use Subscriber Information for any other purpose, unless otherwise agreed in writing between you and the respective Subscriber. For example, you may not, directly or indirectly: (a) disclose any Subscriber Information to any third party, except as necessary for you to perform your obligations under this Agreement and only if you ensure that every recipient uses the information only for that purpose and complies with any restrictions applicable to you; (b) use any Subscriber Information in any way inconsistent with applicable privacy policies or law; or (c) disparage us, our aﬃliates or any of their or our respective products; Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may use Subscriber Information for your marketing or promotional purposes in accordance with applicable privacy policies and law provided that such marketing or promotional communications complies with all applicable laws. Authorized Resellers may also share Subscriber information with ISVs for ISVs to use as described in (i) and (ii) of this section as long as Authorized Resellers have obtained the consent of the Subscribers to share the Subscriber Information. This section does not prevent you from using other information that you acquire without reference to Subscriber Information for any purpose, even if that information is identical to Subscriber Information, as long as you do not target communications based on the intended recipient being a Subscriber.\n\n**3.10 Marketing Restriction.** You may not include in Your Marketplace Content, any advertisements or promotions for, or opportunities for a Subscriber to purchase, products or services that you do not list in Azion Marketplace. If you choose to market or make other references to the availability of Your Marketplace Content, you must refer to Azion Marketplace or use an approved logo provided by us, in compliance with any trademark usage guidelines we specify.\n\n**3.11 Other Rights.** During the term of this Agreement and for so long as Subscribers may use Your Marketplace Content, you grant us a nonexclusive, worldwide license to: (a) reproduce, distribute, display, transmit, promote, and otherwise digitally make available (via all means of online and electronic distribution), Your Marketplace Content (Reseller Content instead for Authorized Resellers) to provide services to you in accordance with this Agreement, provided that no Subscriber shall be provided access to the underlying product of Your Marketplace Content without an active subscription; (b) use (i) your trademarks and logos in the form you provide them to us (with any modifications to optimize their viewing), and (ii) limited portions of Your Marketplace Content (Reseller Content instead for Authorized Resellers) (e.g., product description) for marketing Your Marketplace Content or Azion Marketplace and (c) access, display, promote and otherwise use Your Marketplace Content other than Paid Listings of Data Products (Reseller Content instead for Authorized Resellers) for demonstrating Your Marketplace Content for potential Subscribers. Use of or access to Your Marketplace Content (Reseller Content instead for Authorized Resellers) by Azion for the purposes specified in this section is under the foregoing license and the terms of this Agreement, and such license expressly supersedes any click-through, browse wrap and/or other terms related to Your Marketplace Content (Reseller Content instead for Authorized Resellers). For the sake of clarity, the foregoing license shall be limited in all respects to the purposes and transactions contemplated under this Agreement. We may permit our affiliates and independent contractors to exercise the rights that you grant to us in this Agreement. We assume all liability and responsibility for our affiliates’ and independent contractors’ compliance with, or breach of, the terms of this Agreement.\n\n**3.12 Data Privacy.** If the GDPR applies to our processing of your personal data in Your Marketplace Content:\n\n(1) We will process your personal data in accordance with the instructions provided to us via configuration tools such as the Azion Real-Time Manager and APIs made available by Azion for Azion Marketplace, which includes our technical and organizational measures. Due to the nature of the Azion Marketplace, certain technical measures (which were otherwise optional for you) will be automatically applied by us (e.g., encryption of all Data Products).\n\n(2) Unless otherwise instructed by you, you instruct us to continue to process your personal data in Your Marketplace Content for an active subscription until its expiration or termination.\n\n**4. Reselling on Azion Marketplace.** For the avoidance of doubt, this section does not apply to the third party services listed in Azion Experts.\n\n**4.1 Eligibility.** As agreed by you and another seller or provider on Azion Marketplace, you may (i) designate such other person or entity as a reseller of one or more products for which you have a Paid Listing on Azion Marketplace (in such case, you are an independent software vendor or **“ISV”**), or (ii) accept a designation as a reseller of such other person or entity’s product(s) on Azion Marketplace (in such case, you are an **“Authorized Reseller”**) in accordance with these terms and conditions. To be eligible to use this Azion Marketplace feature, Authorized Reseller and ISV each must be an Azion customer and each must accept the terms and conditions of this Agreement.\n\n**4.2 Authorized Resale Products.** ISV must have a Paid Listing for each product that it authorizes for resale using this Azion Marketplace feature (each an **“Authorized Resale Product”**). ISV’s Paid Listing fulfills the requirement under Section 1 of this Agreement for Authorized Reseller’s eligibility to offer Authorized Resale Products through Azion Marketplace. If ISV has submitted the Authorized Resale Product to us and we have approved it for listing as set forth in Section 3.1, Authorized Reseller need not submit the same Authorized Resale Product to us for review and approval.\n\n**4.3 Establishing Resellers.** To designate or accept a designation as an Authorized Reseller, ISV and Authorized Reseller must complete and agree to an Azion Marketplace Reseller Authorization Form that identifies the specific Authorized Resale Products and the price that Authorized Reseller will pay to ISV for the Authorized Resale Products consistent with the functionality available in Azion Marketplace. To be clear, while the Authorized Reseller must make payments to the ISV, the processing of payments will be as described in Section 5.1. By designating an Authorized Reseller, ISV agrees to sell to Authorized Reseller the specified Authorized Resale Products for resale only and authorizes Authorized Reseller to issue offers for, and resell via offers, the same Authorized Resale Products to Subscribers in Azion Marketplace. By accepting a designation as an Authorized Reseller, Authorized Reseller agrees to purchase the Authorized Resale Products from ISV at the designated price set forth in the Azion Marketplace Reseller Authorization Form solely for resale to Subscribers and to conduct such resales using offers in Azion Marketplace. In addition, ISV and Authorized Reseller may, as agreed by them, specify special pricing that Authorized Reseller will pay to ISV for a custom resale transaction under which Authorized Reseller will issue an offer for, and resell via such offer, the specified product(s) to a designated Subscriber by completing and agreeing to a Custom Resale Transaction Request.\n\n**4.4 Resale Transactions.** Each resale by Authorized Reseller of an Authorized Resale Product to a Subscriber includes a contemporaneous sale of the same Authorized Resale Product from ISV to Authorized Reseller. Each such sale and resale is a Transaction as defined in Section 10.\n\n**4.5 Price Modifications.** To the extent that ISV’s price to Authorized Reseller for an Authorized Resale Product is based on the publicly available price of the corresponding Paid Listing, ISV and Authorized Reseller acknowledge and agree that if ISV modifies the publicly available price for the corresponding Paid Listing, such modification will also modify the price Authorized Reseller pays to ISV for sale of such Authorized Resale Product under the applicable Azion Marketplace Reseller Authorization. Modification of the publicly available price by ISV will not modify the pricing payable by Authorized Reseller for Authorized Resale Products (i) already purchased by Authorized Reseller, or (ii) already offered for resale by Authorized Reseller prior to the ISV’s price modification.\n\n**4.6 Use of Data.** Unless otherwise agreed by the applicable Subscriber, as between Authorized Reseller and ISV, Subscribers are purchasing Authorized Resale Products only from Authorized Reseller and such resales by Authorized Reseller do not create a Subscriber relationship with ISV. Authorized Reseller will not, except as expressly permitted under Section 3.9, disclose to ISV any Subscriber Information arising from Authorized Reseller’s resales of Authorized Resale Products to Subscribers or allow ISV to use any such Subscriber Information. ISV and Authorized Reseller each represent, warrant and covenant that any data or information that it transmits or provides to us or to the other, including any such data or information that we convey to ISV or Authorized Reseller for the other in connection with this Azion Marketplace feature or any Transactions contemplated by this Section, whether proposed or actual, was collected, stored, processed, disclosed and used consistent, in all ways, with applicable privacy policies and law, and that the receipt, storage, use, processing, disclosure or transmission of such data by us or others in connection with this Azion Marketplace feature and the Transactions contemplated by the this Section does not require and does not depend on the need to obtain any additional consents, authorization, or other rights or permissions from any other person or entity.\n\n**4.7 Termination of Reseller Authorization.** Either ISV or Authorized Reseller (the **“Terminating Party”**) may notify us at any time that it wishes to terminate an applicable Azion Marketplace Reseller Authorization. The Terminating Party represents and warrants that its termination of any Azion Marketplace Reseller Authorization complies with the terms and conditions of its agreement with Authorized Reseller or ISV, as applicable.\n\n**4.8 Implementation of Termination.** Upon receipt of a termination notice under Section 4.7 or upon any termination of this Agreement by ISV or Authorized Reseller, we will implement such termination within a reasonable period by (i) removing (a) Authorized Reseller’s ability to purchase Authorized Resale Products from ISV under the applicable Azion Marketplace Reseller Authorization Form and any Azion Marketplace Custom Resale Transaction Request Form, and (b) Authorized Reseller’s ability to issue offers for the same for resale to Subscribers and (ii) removing any offers for Authorized Resale Products issued by Authorized Reseller that have not yet been consummated. Once termination is implemented, we will not facilitate any further Transactions as described in the applicable Azion Marketplace Reseller Authorization Form or any Azion Marketplace Custom Resale Transaction Request Form (ongoing subscriptions obtained through earlier Transactions will not be affected). However, ISV and Authorized Reseller acknowledge and agree we may continue to facilitate Transactions under applicable Azion Marketplace Reseller Authorization Form(s) and Azion Marketplace Custom Resale Transaction Request Form(s) until implementation of termination is complete, and this Agreement will continue to apply to such Transactions.\n\n**4.9 No Interference.** Neither ISV nor Authorized Reseller will interfere with or prejudice the other’s performance of its obligations under this Agreement before or after termination of any Azion Marketplace Reseller Authorization.\n\n**5. Additional Terms for Paid Listings.** If Your Marketplace Content is listed as a Paid Listing, the terms in this Section also apply. All non-Paid Listings of Your Marketplace Content (e.g., bring your own license or free trials of a Data Product) must have a corresponding Paid Listing in Azion Marketplace no later than 90 days after the initial listing of the non-Paid Listing version, unless we determine that we cannot accept Paid Listings from you for regulatory reasons. Any license governing software or data (as applicable) made available via a non-Paid Listing (regardless of the channel used to sell such license) must allow the licensee to use such software or data on Azion without additional fees (including additional support fees), costs, requirements, or restrictions.\n\n**5.1 Processing of Transactions; Collection of Transaction Proceeds.** You hereby appoint us as your payment processing agent for the limited purpose of receiving payments on your behalf from Subscribers or Authorized Resellers (“**Users**”). On your behalf, we will process all payments and refunds for Transactions and collect the applicable Transaction Proceeds. Receipt of funds from Users by us on your behalf for Your Marketplace Content will be deemed receipt of funds from Users by you and will satisfy the obligations owed to you by Users in the amount of the applicable payment by the User. We do not guarantee payment on behalf of any Subscribers, including payments owed to ISV from Authorized Resellers, but nonpayment by Subscribers will not excuse payments owed by Authorized Resellers to ISVs. Unless you have enabled Subscribers to use an existing license to use Your Marketplace Content (e.g., Bring Your Own Subscription for Data Products and Bring Your Own License for software listings), you will ensure that all fees and charges payable by Subscribers for Your Marketplace Content are billed and collected through us and you will not offer or establish any alternative means of payment. Other than with respect to Data Products, we may impose transaction limits on some or all Subscribers and sellers/providers relating to the value of any Transaction or disbursement, the cumulative value of all Transactions or disbursements during a time period or the number of Transactions per day or other time period. We may withhold for investigation, or refuse to process, any of your Transactions that we suspect is fraudulent, unlawful or otherwise violates the terms of this Agreement or our Policies. For the sake of clarity, we will not pay you any fees where we are using Your Marketplace Content for our testing, support, demonstration, or other sales support of Your Marketplace Content as necessary to exercise our rights under Sections 3.1 and 3.11 of this Agreement.\n\n**5.2 Remittance of Transaction Proceeds to You.** At the end of each month, we will pay to you all previously unpaid Transaction Proceeds that we have fully collected as of the date that is 2 business days before the date of payment, provided that Transaction Proceeds from the resale of Authorized Resale Products will be subject to Section 5.3. We will deduct from each payment any Fees due to us related to Your Marketplace Content and the associated Transaction(s). We may also withhold, deduct, or setoff any amounts payable by you to us or our affiliates against any Transaction Proceeds. No Transaction Proceeds will be payable to you for our use of Your Marketplace Content for the purposes described in Section 3.11. All payments to you will be sent to your designated bank account. If there is an error in the processing of any Transaction, you authorize us to debit or credit your designated bank account, to correct such error, provided that any such correction is made in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. If we cannot debit your designated bank account for any reason, you authorize us to resubmit the debit, plus any applicable fees, to any other bank account or payment instrument that you have on file with us or to deduct the debit and applicable fees from future Transaction Proceeds.\n\n**5.3 Resale Transaction Proceeds.** Amounts payable to ISVs from Authorized Resellers for the sale of Authorized Resale Products will be disbursed from Transaction Proceeds that we collect from the contemporaneous resale of such Authorized Resale Products by Authorized Resellers. We do not separately collect payment from Authorized Resellers of the price payable to ISVs for sales of Authorized Resale Products. We will disburse Transaction Proceeds from each resale of an Authorized Resale Product in the following order: (i) we will deduct the Reseller Processing Fee and the ISV Listing Fee for the contemporaneous sale from ISV to Authorized Reseller, (ii) we will disburse remaining Transaction Proceeds to ISV up to the price for the Authorized Resale Product payable by the Authorized Reseller as set forth in the applicable Azion Marketplace Reseller Authorization Form or, if applicable, the Azion Marketplace Custom Resale Transaction Request Form, and (iii) we will disburse any remaining Transaction Proceeds to Authorized Reseller. We do not guarantee payment to ISV on behalf of Authorized Reseller. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, ISV will bear the sole risk of payment in full from Authorized Reseller. If following payment from us to ISV of Transaction Proceeds as set forth above, there is any Shortfall, such Shortfall must be paid by the Authorized Reseller. We have no obligation or liability for any such Shortfall or Authorized Reseller debt.\n\n**5.4 Taxes.** You are responsible for the calculation, invoicing (if required), validation and payment of all sales, use, excise, import, export, value-added, withholding and other taxes and duties assessed, incurred or required to be collected (“**Taxes**”) or paid for any reason in connection with any Transaction and with Your Marketplace Content. We need not determine whether any Taxes apply to any Transaction, and we are not responsible for remitting Taxes to any taxing authority for any Transaction, or for reporting any information (including the payment of Taxes) for any Transaction. Despite the foregoing, when we are legally obligated by a valid taxing authority, we will collect Taxes, and we will provide Subscribers with a compliant tax invoice. All fees and payments payable by you to Azion under this Agreement are exclusive of any applicable taxes, deductions or withholding (including but not limited to cross-border withholding taxes). If any such taxes (for example, cross-border withholding taxes) are required to be withheld on any payment, you will pay such additional amounts as are necessary to the appropriate recipient so that the net amount received by Azion is equal to the amount then due and payable under this Agreement. The following applies only if you are incorporated or organized under the laws of Australia and subject to A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth) (the “**GST Act**”): All supplies made by you through Azion Marketplace (other than GST-free or input taxed supplies) will be treated as if they were inbound intangible consumer supplies made through Azion Marketplace for the purposes of Section 84-60(1) of the GST Act. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing in this Agreement shall, or shall be interpreted or construed to, induce or require either party hereto to act in any manner (including taking or failing to take any actions in connection with a transaction) which is inconsistent with or penalized under any U.S. laws, regulations, rules or requirements that apply to any party to the Agreement.\n\n**5.5 Risk of Loss.** We will bear the risk of fraud associated with our sale or license of the web services offered by Azion, which does not include your Marketplace Content. You will bear all other risk of fraud or loss, including the risk of chargebacks or credit card fraud associated with your sale or license of Your Marketplace Content. If we receive a chargeback or determine a payment related to a Transaction resulted from fraud, then you will promptly reimburse us for the total amount of any applicable Transaction Proceeds paid to you, as well as all credit card association, bank or other payment processing, re-presentment and/or penalty fees associated with the original Transaction.\n\n**5.6 Cancellations and Refunds.** Unless required by the Azion Marketplace Listing Guidelines, you will post your cancellation and refund policy in the listing or offer for Your Marketplace Content in Azion Marketplace or in any Custom Terms (as that term is defined in the Terms and Conditions for Azion Experts) that you specify in the Azion Experts console. At a minimum, this cancellation and refund policy must: (a) allow Subscribers who subscribe to Your Marketplace Content to exercise any rights to cancel subscriptions to Your Marketplace Content through the Azion Marketplace; and (b) comply with the other requirements of this Agreement, including the Azion Marketplace Listing Guidelines. You will accept and process cancellations of, and provide refunds and adjustments for, Your Marketplace Content in accordance with the cancellation and refund policy posted at the time of the applicable Transaction and as otherwise required by law. You will route all Transaction refund (and adjustment) payments through us. We will credit the applicable account, and you will reimburse us for all amounts so refunded.\n\n**5.7 Removal.** Upon removal of the listing or offer of Your Marketplace Content, you will continue to support Your Marketplace Content to current Subscribers for at least 90 days following removal of the listing, unless otherwise stated in the terms with the Subscriber governing use of Your Marketplace Content. If you are an ISV, you will continue to support the Authorized Resale Products to Authorized Reseller until Authorized Reseller’s obligations to its current Subscribers for such Authorized Resale Products are completed.\n\n**6. Term and Termination.** The term of this Agreement will begin on the Effective Date of registration and will continue until terminated. Either party may terminate this Agreement for any or no reason by providing 30 days’ written notice to the other party. Following termination of this Agreement, you will allow existing Subscribers to continue to use Your Marketplace Content on terms and conditions (including price) at least as favorable as those in effect at the time of termination (but in any event consistent with the requirements of Section 3.2) for the greater of (a) 90 days or (b) the term of the contract that the Subscriber signed up for, and on your behalf, we will continue to process all payments and refunds for Transactions and collect the applicable Transaction Proceeds in accordance with Section 5. Despite anything in this Agreement to the contrary, we may terminate an existing Subscriber’s use of Your Marketplace Content (y) at any time in accordance with our agreement with the Subscriber or (z) upon termination of this Agreement for any or no reason.\n\n**7. Indemnification.**\n\n**7.1 General.** You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us, our affiliates and licensors, and each of their and our respective employees, officers, directors, and representatives from and against any loss, claim, liability, damage, action or cause of action (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or relating to any third party claim, including any claim brought by an ISV or Reseller against us, concerning: (a) alleged infringement, misappropriation, or violation of any third-party rights by Your Marketplace Content (Reseller Content instead for Authorized Resellers), or by the copying, use, distribution, sale, development, design, production, advertising or marketing of Your Marketplace Content (Reseller Content instead for Authorized Resellers); (b) a dispute between you and any ISV, Reseller or Subscriber to Your Marketplace Content; (c) any royalties or payments due by you to any third parties as a result of this Agreement; (d) any actual or alleged violation of law, gross negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud by you in connection with Your Marketplace Content; (e) any actual or alleged breach of your representations, warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement, including but not limited to Section 3.3; and (f) any claim or demand for payment of any Taxes imposed in connection with any Transaction, and for any ﬁnes, penalties, or similar charges imposed as a result of your failure to collect, remit or report any Taxes in connection with any Transaction. We will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless you, your aﬃliates and licensors, and each of their and our respective employees, oﬃcers, directors, and representatives from and against any loss, claim, liability, damage, action or cause of action (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or relating to any third party claim concerning: (a) alleged infringement, misappropriation, or violation of any third-party rights in connection with the services we provide you (excluding Your Marketplace Content) or (b) any actual or alleged violation of law, gross negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud by us in connection with providing the services to You under this Agreement.\n\n**7.2 Process.** The indemnified party will promptly notify the other party of any claim subject to Section 7.1, but a failure to promptly notify the indemnifying party will only affect indemnified party’s obligations under Section 7.1 to the extent that our failure prejudices your ability to defend the claim. The indemnifying party may: (a) use counsel of its own choosing (subject to our written consent) to defend against any claim; and (b) settle the claim as it deems appropriate as long as the indemnifying party obtain indemnified party prior written consent before entering into any settlement if such settlement imposes a continuing obligation on the indemnified party.\n\n**8. Disclaimers; Limitations of Liability.**\n\n**8.1 Generally.** EXCEPT AS MAY BE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH OTHERWISE IN THIS AGREEMENT AND EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW, WE, OUR AFFILIATES AND OUR LICENSORS MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE REGARDING ALL SERVICES, SOFTWARE, OR PRODUCTS PROVIDED BY OR ON BEHALF OF US IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, OR THAT ANY CONTENT WILL BE SECURE OR NOT OTHERWISE LOST OR DAMAGED. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW, WE, OUR AFFILIATES AND OUR LICENSORS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF ANY COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.\n\n**8.2 Limitations of Liability.** EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IF ANY PARTY DEFAULTS ON ANY OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND SUBJECT TO THE LIABILITY CAP IN SECTION 8.3, THE NON BREACHING PARTY WILL BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER FROM THE BREACHING PARTY ONLY THE ACTUAL AND DIRECT DAMAGES THAT THE NON BREACHING PARTY MAY INCUR ON ACCOUNT OF SUCH BREACH.

    "body": "\n*Last updated May 25, 2016.*\n\nCustomer will be entitled to Service Credits as provided for in this Service Level Agreement (\"SLA\") and upon Customer’s request, following the procedures set forth below. Any and all cases in which Azion fails to fulfill the Service Level Guarantees below are hereinafter referred to as \"Service Failure.\" Nevertheless, the Service Level Guarantees provided for herein will only be available to customers whose accounts are in good standing and who are not in breach of agreements, terms or other documents, including our Acceptable Use Policy and Documentation. The parties hereto hereby agree that a Service Credit will be Customer’s exclusive financial remedy for a Service Failure, unavailability, performance degradation or any failure by Azion to meet a Service Level, provided Customer is entitled to such credit as set forth herein.\n\n## 1. Service Level Guarantees\n\nAzion will use reasonable commercial efforts to ensure the Services are 100% available according to the Availability Metrics below and the terms hereof. Customer may, at Customer’s expense, choose a third-party Availability Monitoring Service previously approved by Azion or mutually agreed upon by the parties. In the event said third-party Availability Monitoring Service detects a Service Failure as defined in this SLA, Customer will be entitled to receive a Service Credit upon providing sufficient monitoring data according to the defined Service Credit Application procedure.\n\n### Availability Metrics\n\nService Availability will be expressed percentage wise as the total sum of Successful Deliveries, according to the definitions below for each service, over the total requests made within the billing period. The Availability of all services is to be measured from 5 (five) locations in different geographical regions of important metropolitan areas across the world where Azion has a Point of Presence (PoP) and through broadband networks.\n\nAzion Content Delivery\n\nThe availability of Content Delivery, Cloud Storage, Load Balancer, Image Optimization, Application Acceleration, Adaptive Delivery, Edge Firewall, and Web Application Firewall (WAF) services is to be calculated according to the same rules and their respective features correctly set up on the Azion Real-Time Manager for the Test Object.\n\nThe Monitoring Service will execute a HTTP GET operation for the Test Object previously stored in the Azion Cloud Storage and through the corresponding Azion domain. Test Objects must be delivered with HTTP headers allowing cache and TTL (Time-to-Live, i.e. the time the object will remain cached in Azion servers) equal to or longer than 2 hours and size between 1KB and 10KB. The feature to be tested must be correctly set up on the Azion Real-Time Manager for the Test Object. The interval between requests will be 5 minutes at the least and 30 minutes at the most. In return, the Monitoring Service should expect a successful HTTP code (class 2xx status code) or \"Not Modified\" code (304 status code). A Service Failure will be deemed to have occurred when 2 consecutive test attempts have failed in all 5 regions at the same time, except for the situations provided for in the Service Guarantee Coverage Exceptions section. Otherwise, the event will be logged as a Successful Delivery.\n\nAzion Media Packager\n\nThe Monitoring Service must execute a HTTP GET operation for the playlist of audio-type Test Object encoded in AAC, sized under 10MB and previously stored in the Azion Cloud Storage, in a bucket with a configured Media Packager, and through the corresponding Azion domain. The interval between requests will be 5 minutes at the least and 30 minutes at the most. In return, the Monitoring Service should expect a successful HTTP code (class 2xx status code). A Service Failure will be deemed to have occurred when 2 consecutive test attempts have failed in all 5 regions at the same time, except for the situations provided for in the Service Guarantee Coverage Exceptions section. Otherwise, the event will be logged as a Successful Delivery.\n\nAzion Live Ingest\n\nThe Monitoring Service must execute a HTTP GET operation for a playlist of the previously configured Test Object to deliver a Live Signal obtained from the Azion Live Ingest product, through the corresponding Azion domain. The interval between requests will be 5 minutes at the least and 30 minutes at the most. In return, the Monitoring Service should expect a successful HTTP code (class 2xx status code). A Service Failure will be deemed to have occurred when 2 consecutive test attempts have failed in all 5 regions at the same time, save in case there is an interruption at the signal’s origin and for the situations provided for in the Service Guarantee Coverage Exceptions section. Otherwise, the event will be logged as a Successful Delivery.\n\n## 2. Service Guarantee Coverage Exceptions\n\nFailures resulting from the reasons below do not apply to this SLA, are not eligible for Service Credits, and are deemed Service Guarantee Coverage Exceptions: (i) factors beyond Azion’s control, such as natural disasters, wars or terrorist attacks, government actions preventing Azion from providing the Services, network or internet access failures or failures of devices not belonging to Azion POPs, including Customer equipment failures or failures between Customer’s equipment and ours; (ii) actions under Customer’s control, such as firewall blockage, disconnection from Azion Services, setup or content deactivation or exclusion by Customer or Azion at Customer’s request; (iii) suspension or termination of Customer’s Services or this Agreement; (iv) improper use or use in violation of our Service Acceptable Use Policy; (v) Peak Traffic, when defined in applicable Agreements or Work Orders; (vi) use of system Beta versions, when thus identified by Azion to Customer; (vii) unauthorized action by anyone having access to the Azion platform by means of Customer’s passwords or equipment. Additionally, except as otherwise agreed upon in writing by the parties, Service Level Guarantees do not apply during a maintenance window announced by Azion.\n\n## 3. Service Credits\n\nService Credits are calculated as a percentage of the monthly payment¹ owed by Customer for the Service impacted by a Service Failure, according to the percentages defined below and subject to the criteria, terms and conditions provided for herein.\n\n| Service Availability (monthly)                 | Service Credit Percentage |\n| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |\n| Higher than or equal to 99% and less than 100% | 10%                       |\n| Less than 99%                                  | 25%                       |\n\n*¹ For customers whose agreements are use-based (i.e. On Demand, without Reserved Capacity), Service Credits will be calculated as the percentage of the combined monthly amount paid by customer for the Service impacted by a Service Failure in the month to which said Service Failure applies.*\n\nService Credits may not be transferred or assigned to any other account other than Customer’s, and are the exclusive financial remedy for any failure or unavailability by Azion with respect to the services provided. Service Credits may be used at the end of the Agreement or upon the renewal hereof to purchase any Azion services or as a discount, and the parties hereby agree that such credits do not entitle Customer to any reimbursement or other forms of payment by Azion. Under no circumstances whatsoever will Service Credits exceed the amount paid or owed by Customer for a given Service.\n\n## 4. Service Credit Application Process\n\nCustomer must follow the procedures below to apply for Service Credits:\n\nI. Filing deadline: Service Credit Applications must be submitted to Azion within 7 (seven) business days after a Service Failure event. Customer’s failure to notify Azion about an SLA violation and provide the other information required will preclude Customer from receiving said Service Credits.\n\nII. Required Information: each Service Credit Application must include the following information: (a) name of Customer and name of impacted configuration; (b) name of Customer’s contact person and contact information; (c) date and time (including time zone) of Service Failure events, along with information on failures, regions used for the tests, test URL, and the feedback or timeout codes obtained; (d) the numbers of tickets opened with the Azion Support specifically about the issue, along with a brief description of the failure’s characteristics and metrics; and (e) the name of the Azion-approved third-party Monitoring Service used, as well as the logs and screens showing the failures.\n\nIII. Service Credit Application Process: Customer must submit the required information via ticket to the Azion Support. Azion will acknowledge all applications sent in by the deadline after the Service Failure and review all applications within 30 (thirty) business days after receiving them. Customer will be notified through the ticket whether a Service Credit has been granted or refused, as provided for in this SLA. In case it is refused, the notice will detail the grounds for such refusal.\n\nAzion will look into all of the reasonably provided information and in good faith determine whether a Service Credit is owed.\n",

Os produtos e serviços são tarifados de acordo com o uso, modalidade de contratação e preços conforme definidos na Ordem de Serviço ou Site da Azion.\n\n## Produtos e Serviços\n\nContent Delivery: serviço de entrega de conteúdos web de qualquer formato e tipo, inclusive HTTP Live Streaming (HLS), por meio dos protocolos HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1 e HTTP/2 e dos métodos HTTP GET, HEAD e OPTIONS. Inclui acesso a (1) rede da Azion para entrega de conteúdo; (2) funcionalidade de cache de conteúdos; (3) manipulação de cabeçalhos HTTP; (4) criação de regras para redirecionamento, bloqueio de acesso ou entrega do conteúdo; (5) Analytics com indicadores básicos do serviço; (6) ferramenta de Real-Time Purge com suporte a Wildcard; (7) entrega de conteúdo em cache enquanto a origem estiver inacessível (*stale while revalidate*); (8) entrega de conteúdo HTTPS (TLS) com suporte a OCSP Stapling; (9) upload de certificado TLS/SNI, caso suportado pelo browser do usuário, ou uso do certificado compartilhado da Azion, e (10) integração com todos os produtos e serviços da Azion. Para utilizar este serviço, é necessário que o Cliente armazene a versão original de Seu Conteúdo em um servidor web de origem, que pode ser o Cloud Storage da Azion ou qualquer servidor com acesso HTTP. Para garantir o bom funcionamento dos serviços, a Azion poderá habilitar, desabilitar ou modificar serviços, POPs, endereços IPs, servidores ou qualquer equipamento, sem aviso prévio, sempre visando a manutenção da performance e disponibilidade dos mesmos. NÃO EXISTE UMA GARANTIA DE QUE O CONTEÚDO (OBJETO) ESTARÁ DISPONÍVEL EM CACHE DURANTE TODA DURAÇÃO DO TIME-TO-LIVE (TTL) CONFIGURADO PELO CLIENTE. A AZION FAZ OS INVESTIMENTOS NECESSÁRIOS PARA MANTER OS DADOS EM CACHE PELO TEMPO MAIS PRÓXIMO DO QUE FOR CONFIGURADO PELOS CLIENTES, PORÉM OS OBJETOS MENOS ACESSADOS PODEM SER AUTOMATICAMENTE REMOVIDOS DO CACHE PARA CEDER ESPAÇO PARA OBJETOS DE MAIOR VOLUME DE ACESSOS ATRAVÉS DE UM ALGORITMO DE LRU (LEAST RECENTLY USED). O TAMANHO MÁXIMO DE OBJETO É DE 10GB E, PARA UTILIZAR O SERVIÇO COM OBJETOS MAIORES É NECESSÁRIO AUTORIZAÇÃO DA AZION POR ESCRITO.\n\nApplication Acceleration: serviço de aceleração de aplicações web e APIs. Inclui acesso a funcionalidades de otimização de protocolos, regras avançadas de cache (Advanced Cache Key) que permite o cache granular, segmentação e políticas de cache com base em critérios como name/value de Cookies e Query Strings, além de funcionalidades como Bypass Cache, KeepAlive e Forward Cookies. Disponibiliza os métodos HTTP GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE e OPTIONS.\n\nAdaptive Delivery: provê um serviço de detecção de dispositivos baseado na User Agent String enviada pelo Usuário, permitindo a entrega de conteúdos para diferentes dispositivos e formatos a partir da mesma URL. A eficiência do produto depende da correta configuração das expressões regulares que viabilizam o mapeamento dos tipos de dispositivos e correspondentes User Agent Strings. É responsabilidade do Cliente a manutenção e atualização da lista de grupos de dispositivos, que pode contar com as listas pré-definidas pela Azion. Cabe ao servidor de origem do Cliente a entrega do conteúdo mais adequado para cada tipo de dispositivo, de acordo com a detecção realizada pelo Adaptive Delivery e informada ao servidor de origem por meio de um campo de cabeçalho HTTP X-UA-Device. As variações de conteúdo poderão ser cacheadas nos Edge Servers da Azion, de acordo com as configurações definidas.\n\nLoad Balancer: serviço projetado para balancear o tráfego HTTP/HTTPS do cliente entre origens distribuídas em múltiplos datacenters, provedores de serviço (multi-cloud) ou em um mesmo datacenter, eliminando ou minimizando a necessidade de hardware ou software dedicadas e reduzindo o impacto de falhas locais na disponibilidade global do conteúdo. Inclui acesso as funcionalidades de (1) balanceamento Round-Robin, Least Connections e IP Hash; (2) atribuição de diferentes pesos às origens; (3) configuração de servidores Primary ou Backup (*standby*); (4) manipulação de erros e exceções em caso de *timeout* para conectar ou receber uma resposta da origem, ou em caso da resposta HTTP da origem ser um erro 404 (*Not Found*) ou 5xx.\n\nAnalytics: serviço de monitoramento de indicadores dos produtos e serviços Azion. Provê uma interface web para análise de gráficos e indicadores coletados de acordo com as configurações dos Clientes. Possui uma versão Standard, incluída no serviço Content Delivery, que disponibiliza os principais indicadores de monitoramento, como *Data Transferred, Bandwidth e Requests,* além de indicadores específicos para os diversos produtos e serviços Azion contratados como WAF, Live Ingest, Cloud Storage, Image Optimization e Media Packager, com filtragem por período e retenção dos dados por 12 meses. Possui também uma versão Premium, que disponibiliza filtros para segmentação dos dados por configuração do Cliente, retenção dos dados por 24 meses, exportação dos dados para CSV, além de indicadores mais avançados, como *Status Codes, HTTP Methods,* dentre outros.\n\nEdge Firewall: permite a criação de regras de controle de acesso ao conteúdo e aplicações diretamente nos Edge Servers da Azion. O controle de acesso pode ser realizado por endereço IP ou rede, geolocalização (país de acesso), HTTP Referer, Secure Token e Rate Limit. A Azion utiliza bases de dados de fornecedores externos para identificação de geolocalização baseada no endereço IP do Usuário, as quais podem ser imprecisas em algumas situações, cabendo ao Cliente a responsabilidade pelo uso dessa funcionalidade de restrição de acesso. O bloqueio por HTTP Referer se baseia em informações fornecidas pelo Browser ou aplicação que requisita o conteúdo, podendo ter sofrido manipulação maliciosa por parte do Usuário para obter acesso indevido, cabendo, portanto, ao Cliente a responsabilidade por esse tipo de controle de acesso. Rate Limit é calculado individualmente para cada Edge Server da Azion, não constituindo, portanto, um limite global de acesso ao conteúdo. Secure Token representa um mecanismo de validação de acesso baseado em Hash MD5, cabendo ao Cliente a segurança da Secret utilizada para geração do Hash e estando o Cliente ciente de que o algoritmo MD5 pode ser afetado por colisões para obtenção de acesso indevido ao conteúdo. A AZION PROVÊ MECANISMOS DE CONTROLE DE ACESSO BASEADOS NO MELHOR ESFORÇO, MAS QUE NÃO CONSTITUEM RESTRIÇÕES INTRANSPONÍVEIS CONTRA ACESSOS NÃO AUTORIZADOS. O CLIENTE DEVE REALIZAR A RESTRIÇÃO DE ACESSO POR ENDEREÇO IP PARA OBTER O MELHOR NÍVEL DE CONTROLE E A AZION RECOMENDA A COMBINAÇÃO DE MÚLTIPLAS TÉCNICAS.\n\nWeb Application Firewall (WAF): provê uma camada de proteção para aplicações web, com funcionalidades como: (1) controle para mitigar ameaças como SQL Injections, Cross-Site Scripting, RFI, entre outros; (2) criação de Rule Sets configuráveis para seleção dos mecanismos de proteção desejados e sensibilidade das regras; (3) criação de Whitelists customizadas de acordo com o comportamento da aplicação; (4) opção de Counting Mode para análise de ameaças sem o efetivo bloqueio das mesmas; (5) gráficos em tempo real contendo informações sobre ameaças detectadas e ataques bloqueados. Recomendamos habilitar a funcionalidade de Counting Mode assistido pelo Suporte da Azion para etapa de aprendizado dos comportamentos da aplicação, para melhorar a eficiência do serviço e reduzir o risco de identificação de falsos positivos e bloqueio de requisições legítimas. Ainda assim, advertimos de que pode haver o bloqueio de requisições legítimas à aplicação, caso coincidam com alguma das regras de segurança do WAF. A AZION ESTÁ CONSTANTEMENTE BUSCANDO ATUALIZAÇÃO DE SEUS MECANISMOS DE SEGURANÇA PARA AUMENTAR A EFETIVIDADE DOS SISTEMAS DE PROTEÇÃO E REDUZIR O RISCO DE ATAQUES ÀS APLICAÇÕES DO CLIENTE, NO ENTANTO, NÃO HÁ UMA GARANTIA DE QUE O SERVIÇO WAF SERÁ CAPAZ DE PREVENIR TODAS AS POSSIBILIDADES DE ATAQUES OU AMEAÇAS. RECOMENDAMOS QUE OS CLIENTES MANTENHAM OS CONTROLES DE SEGURANÇA TAMBÉM EM SUAS ORIGENS. O CLIENTE ASSUME TODO O RISCO DE CAUSAR INDISPONIBILIDADE DE SERVIÇO DEVIDO A REGRAS MAL CONFIGURADAS. O ACORDO DE NÍVEL DE SERVIÇO (SLA) NÃO SE APLICA QUANDO REGRAS PERSONALIZADAS SÃO CRIADAS PELO CLIENTE.\n\nImage Optimization: é o serviço de otimização e a manipulação dinâmica de imagens. As funcionalidades suportadas são: (1) otimização; (2) corte; (3) redimensionamento; (4) conversão de formato e (5) aplicações de filtros como blur, noise, marca d’água, dentre outros. Os formatos suportados são JPEG, GIF e PNG. A manipulação das imagens é realizada através de parâmetros de Query String enviados na requisição. A otimização da imagem consiste no processo de reduzir o tamanho do arquivo de imagem, quando possível, buscando minimizar as perdas de qualidade perceptíveis da imagem, decorrentes do processo de otimização. O serviço pode entregar a imagem em um formato de arquivo distinto do original, de acordo com o Browser de acesso do Usuário, buscando uma melhor otimização da entrega. Não há uma garantia de ganho no processo de otimização cabendo ao cliente monitorar o ganho médio decorrente do uso do serviço. O CLIENTE DEVE ESTAR CIENTE DE QUE O PROCESSO DE OTIMIZAÇÃO DE IMAGENS ALTERA O CONTEÚDO ENTREGUE PARA O USUÁRIO FINAL, PODENDO RESULTAR EM DIFERENÇAS NA QUALIDADE VISUAL DA IMAGEM. A AZION PODERÁ, A QUALQUER MOMENTO E SEM AVISO PRÉVIO, ATUALIZAR OS ALGORITMOS DE OTIMIZAÇÃO, RESULTANDO EM DIFERENÇAS NO CONTEÚDO ENTREGUE E NA EFICIÊNCIA DA OTIMIZAÇÃO.\n\nCloud Storage: oferece armazenamento baseado em nuvem com alta disponibilidade, replicação multi-datacenter, segurança e durabilidade dos dados. Pode ser utilizado como servidor de origem para o Content Delivery e é integrado a outros serviços, como Media Packager, Media Encoder e Log Streaming. A transferência dos arquivos para o Cloud Storage pode ser realizada utilizando-se os protocolos FTP ou RSYNC e, em caráter Beta, SFTP e SCP.\n\nLive Ingest: é o serviço oferecido para ingestão de Live Streaming para posterior distribuição através do Content Delivery. A ingestão da transmissão Live deve ser realizada utilizando-se o protocolo RTMP, autenticada através de usuário e senha e utilizando um *encoder* homologado pela Azion. Para melhorar a disponibilidade da transmissão, recomenda-se a configuração de dois RTMP Endpoints, um Primary e um Backup, em regiões geográficas distintas. O serviço provê a funcionalidade de Dynamic Packaging, para converter o formato de entrega para HLS, para que possa ser distribuído pelo Content Delivery em HTTP. O *encoder* do Cliente deve respeitar as recomendações de configuração, formatos e codecs suportados pelo serviço e homologados pela Azion.\n\nMedia Encoder: provê o serviço de *transcoding*, ou troca de codec, de mídias (áudio e vídeo) do Cliente. Os arquivos de mídia devem ser armazenados no Cloud Storage para posterior *transcoding*, de acordo com o perfil de codificação desejado pelo Cliente. Assim que processada a requisição, os novos arquivos com o perfil de codificação selecionado são armazenados em um bucket do Cloud Storage, para posterior uso pelo Cliente. As requisições devem ser encaminhadas por ticket pelo Cliente para a equipe de Customer Services.\n\nMedia Packager: serviço que provê troca dinâmica de formato de arquivos de mídias (áudio e vídeo) para distribuição de VoD através do Content Delivery, em HTTP. Os formatos de mídia suportados são FLV (Flash Video), MP4 (QuickTime – .mp4, .f4v, .mov, .m4v, .mp4a, .3gp, .3g2), .ismv, .isma e MP3 (.mp3). O formato de entrega é HTTP Live Streaming (HLS). Os arquivos de mídia devem ser armazenados em um bucket do Cloud Storage com Media Packager habilitado ou em um servidor web externo, desde que previamente homologado pela Azion. Outros formatos de entrega, como HDS, Smooth Streaming e MPEG-DASH, poderão ser disponibilizados para os Clientes, a critério da Azion, em caráter Beta.\n\nDigital Certificates: é o serviço de intermediação e manutenção da emissão de certificados SSL compartilhados, do tipo Domain Validated (DV), junto a uma Autoridade Certificadora (CA) de escolha da Azion, para uso único e exclusivo no serviço Content Delivery. O Cliente deve estar apto a comprovar a autoridade pelos domínios desejados, seguindo os procedimentos técnicos solicitados pela CA. O certificado SSL e chave privada são compartilhados entre múltiplos Clientes e serão de posse exclusiva da Azion. O certificado e ou chave privada não será, sob hipótese alguma, enviado ao Cliente.\n\nDDoS Protection: ataques DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) é um tipo de ataque no qual inúmeros sistemas comprometidos externos são utilizados para sobrecarregar um sistema alvo resultando em negação de serviço. A Azion provê uma moderna abordagem de filtragem de ataques do tipo DDoS através de seu Mitigation Center, reduzindo o impacto do ataque pela absorção e filtragem do pico de tráfego malicioso e reduzindo o risco de tarifação de excedente pelo tráfego indesejado. O serviço é gerenciado pela equipe de profissionais da Azion e não requer configurações por parte do Cliente. O CLIENTE DEVE ESTAR CIENTE DE QUE O SERVIÇO NÃO ELIMINA OU PREVINE TODOS OS TIPOS DE ATAQUE DDOS E DEVE ENTRAR EM CONTATO COM O SUPORTE DA AZION CASO ALGUM ATAQUE DDOS NÃO SEJA DETECTADO E PREVENIDO PARA QUE OUTRAS AÇÕES DE MITIGAÇÃO POSSAM SER EXECUTADAS. O CLIENTE CONCORDA COM A FILTRAGEM DO TRÁFEGO DURANTE ATAQUES DE DDOS, O QUE PODE EVENTUALMENTE OCASIONAR FILTRAGEM DE TRÁFEGO LEGÍTIMO OU NÃO MALICIOSO.\n\nSupport: o serviço de Suporte da Azion é recomendado para clientes que precisam de ajuda para operar os produtos Azion e está disponível nas modalidades Developer, Enterprise ou Mission Critical. As modalidades Enterprise e Mission Critical dispõem de canais para atendimento a incidentes 24x7x365 e, em horário comercial, para esclarecimento de dúvidas referentes aos produtos Azion. O Tempo de Resposta (SLA) é definido de acordo com a modalidade contratada e prioridade do ticket: (i) Mission Critical: 20 min ou menos para tickets com prioridade Production Down, 1h para High, 6h para Normal e 12h para Low; (ii) Enterprise: 1h ou menos para tickets com prioridade High, 6h para Normal e 12h para Low; (iii) Developer: 6h úteis ou menos para tickets com prioridade Normal e 12h úteis para Low.\n\n## Modalidade de Contratação e Cobrança\n\nContratação *On Demand*: modalidade de contratação na qual o Cliente paga conforme a utilização dos Produtos e Serviços Azion. O valor a ser pago pelo Cliente para cada Serviço utilizado corresponde à multiplicação do montante apurado pela Azion para a Métrica de Contabilização do Serviço no período de faturamento e o seu respectivo Valor Unitário, discriminado na Ordem de Serviço ou no Site da Azion. Quando especificadas Faixas de Consumo Mensal na Ordem de Serviço, Valores Unitários reduzidos serão aplicados para a parcela de consumo que exceder a faixa imediatamente superior, respeitando-se os Valores Unitários e as respectivas Faixas de Consumo definidas na Ordem de Serviço.\n\nContratação Reserva de Capacidade: modalidade de contratação na qual o Cliente se compromete com o consumo mensal reservado, especificado na Ordem de Serviço. O pagamento ocorre antecipadamente no valor correspondente a capacidade reservada para o Cliente. Em havendo excedente de uso da capacidade reservada no período de faturamento e de acordo com a apuração realizada pela Azion para a Métrica de Contabilização, será cobrado o consumo excedente do Cliente, multiplicando-se a parcela que exceder a capacidade reservada pelo respectivo Valor Unitário por Excedente, discriminado na Ordem de Serviço. O volume não utilizado em um mês, se houver, não poderá ser utilizado nos meses seguintes.\n\n## Métricas e Metodologias de Contabilização de Uso dos Produtos\n\nData Transferred (total): refere-se ao volume total de GB trafegados através dos Edge Servers da Azion, para todas as configurações do Cliente, independente os serviços habilitados em cada configuração. Corresponde a soma do tráfego entregue para os usuários que requisitam o conteúdo ou aplicação e o tráfego para buscar o conteúdo nos servidores de origem, mesmo quando se tratar de servidores de origem internos da rede Azion, como no caso dos serviços Cloud Storage, Image Optimization, Live Ingest e Media Packager. Essa métrica representa o total de tráfego que entra (*ingress*) e que sai (*egress*) da rede de Edge Servers da Azion e representa a métrica de tarifação básica para os serviços Content Delivery e DDoS Protection. A métrica Data Transferred (total) é compartilhada (*shared*) entre todos os produtos que utilizam os Edge Servers da Azion.\n\nData Transferred: refere-se ao volume total de GB trafegados através dos Edge Servers da Azion, para as configurações de Content Delivery do Cliente que estejam com algum serviço específico ativado, como no caso dos Serviços Application Acceleration, Adaptive Delivery ou Load Balancer, geralmente expresso entre parênteses ao lado do nome desta métrica ou, por omissão, quando do contexto da explicação do Serviço. Corresponde a soma do tráfego entregue para os usuários que requisitam o conteúdo ou aplicação e o tráfego para buscar o mesmo nos servidores de origem, para as configurações com o Serviço habilitado. A métrica Data Transferred é computada individualmente para cada Serviço e, caso uma configuração do Cliente possua mais de um serviço ativado simultaneamente, o tráfego através dessa configuração irá incrementar as métricas Data Transferred de todos os serviços que estiverem ativados, além de incrementar simultaneamente o Data Transferred (total).\n\nRequests: refere-se à soma total de requisições HTTP e de requisições HTTPS dos usuários para os Edge Servers da Azion, quando processadas, analisadas ou armazenadas por algum serviço Azion específico, como Analytics Premium, Log Streaming, Edge Firewall ou Web Application Firewall. A métrica Requests é computada individualmente para cada serviço e, caso uma mesma requisição HTTP ou HTTPS seja analisada, processada ou armazenada simultaneamente por mais de um serviço Azion, irá incrementar a métrica Requests de todos os serviços envolvidos no processamento da requisição. A contabilização de Requests ocorre em blocos de um milhão e os valores fracionários, quando houver, serão arredondados para cima.\n\nImages Processed: volume total de imagens processadas pelo serviço Image Optimization, quer para otimização, corte, redimensionamento, aplicação de filtro e demais funcionalidades do serviço. A contabilização de Imagens processadas ocorre a cada requisição dos Edge Servers Azion para o serviço de Image Optimization. A contabilização de Images Processed ocorre em blocos de um milhão e os valores fracionários, quando houver, serão arredondados para cima.\n\nUsed Space: pico de utilização de espaço em GB no produto Cloud Storage, durante o período de faturamento, para armazenamento de arquivos do Cliente, logs do serviço Log Streaming ou mídias resultantes do processo de encoding do serviço Media Encoder.\n\nData Ingested: refere-se ao volume total de GB transferidos pelo Cliente para o serviço Live Ingest, processo denominado de *ingesting*, para posterior distribuição aos Edges Servers da Azion.\n\nData Encoded: refere-se ao volume total de GB codificados pelo serviço Media Encoder, no período de faturamento. A codificação da mídia segue a especificação de um perfil definido pelo Cliente. Caso a codificação resulte em múltiplas mídias, o Volume de dados (Data Encoded) é representado pela soma total do tamanho das mídia codificadas, no processo denominado de *encoding*.\n\nData Packaged: refere-se ao volume total de GB trafegados através do produto Media Packager. Corresponde a soma do volume de dados enviados pelo Media Packager aos Edge Servers Azion, no processo denominado de *transmuxing* ou *dynamic packaging, com o volume de dados recebidos pelo Media Packager dos servidores de origem, caso as mídias estejam armazenadas em local diferente do Azion Cloud Storage. O troca de tráfego entre o produto Cloud Storage e o produto Media Packager não é tarifada.*\n\n*Wildcard domains: refere-se a quantidade de domínios \\*wildcard\\* para fins de emissão de certificados SSL compartilhados.Unidades UtilizadasA Azion respeita a convenção ISO/IEC 80000 e, portanto, a conversão dos fatores de unidades de tráfego é sempre realizada por 1.000.TB: terabyte(s), 1 TB = 1.000 GB.\nGB: gigabyte(s), 1 GB = 1.000 MB.\nMB: megabyte(s), 1 MB = 1.000 KB.\nKB ou kB: kilobyte(s), 1KB = 1.000 bytes.*\n",

    "body": "\n*Last updated: November 10, 2020.*\n\nThe following definitions related to Products and Services, billing methods, and other terms apply to the purchase and use of Azion Products and Services. We are constantly looking to improve our solutions. Consequently, this document may be updated and you should always look at its latest version.\n\nAll Azion products and services are offered as Edge Services and available through specific Internet communication protocols. Our servers are located at various points of presence (POPs) across the world. Azion Products and Services are orchestrated and configured via the Real-Time Manager interface or its APIs. Products and Services are billed according to their use, type of contract, and prices, as defined in the Customer Agreement.\n\n## 1. Products and Services\n\n**Adaptive Delivery:** an Edge Application module designed to detect devices based on the User Agent String sent by users and allowing the delivery of content to different devices and formats from the same URL. The product’s efficiency depends on the proper configuration of the regular expressions that make it possible to map the types of devices and corresponding User Agent Strings. Customer is responsible for keeping and updating the list of device groups, which may include the lists predefined by Azion. Customer’s origin server has the duty of delivering the most appropriate content for each type of device, according to the detection conducted by Adaptive Delivery reported to the origin server via a customizable HTTP header field. Content changes may be cached in Azion’s Edge, according to the defined configurations. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Adaptive Delivery will be billed considering the Data Transferred according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**Application Acceleration:** an Edge Application module designed to accelerate web applications and APIs. It includes access to protocol optimization features, advanced caching rules (Advanced Cache Key) which allows granular caching with minimum TTL of 0 seconds, segmentation and caching policies based on criteria such as name/value of Cookies and Query Strings, in addition to features such as Rules Engine, Bypass Cache, KeepAlive, Forward Cookies, POST Cache, among others. HTTP GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE and OPTIONS methods available. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Application Acceleration will be billed considering the Data Transferred according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**Data Streaming:** designed to collect data from the Edge Applications or any other Azion's Products and Services. The Customer will choose which data to be collected and, by doing so, automatically declare to be authorized to collect all the selected data. AZION DOES NOT HOLD RESPONSIBILITY BY: (A) THE USAGE OF THE DATA BY THE CUSTOMER, (B) THE CUSTOMER RIGHTS TO COLLECT THEIR USER'S DATA. The collected data is sent to the customer's infrastructure using the protocol chosen in the Real-Time Manager interface or API by the Customer, formatted in NDJSON (Newline Delimited JSON) in a configurable template. The data is dispatched in blocks of 2 thousand requests separated by \\n (Newline), or 60 seconds, whichever happens first. Azion will use all commercially reasonable efforts to send all the data to the Customer's infrastructure, or its suppliers, in real time or with a delay lower than 3 minutes. However, in the case of access peaks, attacks or external causes, the delay can be greater. THE CUSTOMER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE AVAILABILITY OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO RECEIVE THE DATA AND, IN CASE OF UNAVAILABILITY, AZION CAN DISCARD THE DATA. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Data Streaming will be billed considering the (a) Data Streaming Requests and (b) Data Streamed, according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**DDoS Protection:** DDoS Protection will be provided exclusively under the terms available at https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/ddos-protection/ (“Guidelines”). By using Azion, Customer (i) authorizes Azion to impose the technical measures available on the Azion platform to control or mitigate DDoS attacks, even though such measures may result in performance degradation, and (ii) acknowledges that the Service Level Agreement (\"SLA\") does not apply while a DDoS attack is underway. The following Azion DDoS Protection service options are available: (i) DDoS Protection - 5 Gbps: includes the following features: (a) network flow analysis (layers 3 and 4); (b) detection of the most common DDoS attacks, network and transport layers, and (c) mitigation of the most common DDoS attacks, network and transport layers, up to the limit of 5 Gbps; (ii) DDoS Protection - 20 Gbps, includes all of the DDoS Protection - 5 Gbps features plus: (a) detection of more sophisticated DDoS attacks; (b) cost protection via service credits, when applicable; (c) mitigation of larger DDoS attacks up to 20 Gbps; (iii) DDoS Protection - 50 Gbps extends the protection against DDoS attacks up to 50 Gbps; and (iv) DDoS Protection - Unlimited, for unlimited protection against DDoS attacks, the mitigation may use the entire Azion network, in addition to 24x7 access to our Security Response Team (SRT) upon the purchase our Support Mission Critical service. Attacks exceeding the volumes purchased may be immediately blocked until the attack ends. To be eligible for a Service Credit (a) the DDoS attack must result in a bill that exceed the double of the average monthly consumption in the previous six (6) months, excluding the months in which a DDoS attack took place; (b) in the event of an impossibility to calculate the average monthly consumption in the previous six months, the average consumption volume in the available months will be used as basis; (c) Customer must notify the Azion Technical Support about an attack underway by registering a Support Ticket; (d) the Azion Technical Support must have determined the reported DDoS attack is a legitimate attack; and (e) credit applications must be sent by Customer within 30 days after the disputed service bill is closed. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Managed DDoS Protection will be billed at (a) a monthly set fee according to the protection limit purchased (Protection Fee) and, additionally, (b) a fee per total GB traffic (Total Data Transferred). By purchasing our Managed DDoS Protection service, the Customer will be required to pay for a minimum of twelve (12) months of the service. In the event Customer’s average bill exceeds the volume purchased, or in case more than two credits are applied for in a given calendar year, Azion will be entitled to require Customer to pay an additional DDoS Protection Fee for each attack suffered. Only a single credit may be applied each month, even when several attacks take place in the same month. Credits are to be issued as a credit note instead of a revised bill. AZION IS CONSTANTLY SEEKING TO UPGRADE OUR SECURITY MECHANISMS TO MAKE OUR PROTECTION SYSTEMS MORE EFFECTIVE AND REDUCE THE RISK OF IMPACTS TO CUSTOMER APPLICATIONS. HOWEVER, THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES THE DDOS SERVICE WILL BE ABLE TO PREVENT ALL POSSIBLE ATTACKS OR THREATS. CUSTOMERS SHOULD KEEP SECURITY CONTROLS AT THEIR ORIGINS AS WELL. CUSTOMERS ASSUME ALL RISKS OF SERVICE UNAVAILABILITY OWING TO RULES POORLY CONFIGURED IN THE SERVICE.\n\n**Digital Certificates:** this service brokers and obtains the issuance of shared SSL certificates of the Domain Validated (DV) type from a Certification Authority (CA) chosen by Azion, to be used solely for the Edge Application service. Customers must be able to prove their authority over the desired domains by following the technical procedures set by the CA. SSL certificates and private keys are shared among multiple Customers and will be held exclusively by Azion. Under no circumstances whatsoever will certificates and/or private keys be sent to the Customers. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Digital Certificates will be billed considering the number of Digital Certificates according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**Edge Application:** designed to enable Customers to build and run their own serverless applications at the Edge of the network, closer to users and devices. It is the ideal solution for applications that require low latency response time or real-time data processing. Each Edge Application can be assigned to multiple domains which can be accessed by users and devices. To guarantee the proper working of the service, Azion may enable, disable or modify services, POPs, IPs address, servers, any equipment or Customer content, without previous notice, always aiming the maintenance or performance improvement and availability. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Edge Application will be billed considering the number of (a) Domains and (b) Edge Applications, according to the volumes consumed, and the volume consumed by its modules.\n\n**Edge Caching:** an Edge Application's module designed to deliver web contents of all formats and types, including HTTP Live Streaming (HLS), via the HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1, and HTTP/2 protocols, along with support for the HTTP GET, HEAD and OPTIONS methods. Includes access to (1) the Azion network for content delivery; (2) content caching feature with minimum TTL of 60 seconds; (3) HTTP header manipulation; (4) creation of redirecting or content delivery rules; (5) the Real-Time Purge tool; (6) delivery of cached content while the origin is inaccessible; (7) delivery of HTTPS (TLS) with OCSP Stapling support; (8) digital certificate uploads and support for the TLS x509 SNI format, in case it is supported by the user’s browser, or use of the shared certificate in Azion’s domain; (9) integration with Azion Products and Services. To use this service, Customers need to store the original version of their Content in an origin web server with HTTP access. THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES THAT CONTENTS (OBJECTS) WILL BE AVAILABLE IN CACHE THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE TIME-TO-LIVE (TTL) CONFIGURED BY THE CUSTOMER. AZION MAKES THE NECESSARY INVESTMENTS TO KEEP DATA CACHED FOR THE CLOSEST TIME TO THAT CONFIGURED BY CUSTOMERS, HOWEVER, LEAST ACCESSED OBJECTS MAY BE AUTOMATICALLY DELETED FROM THE CACHE TO MAKE ROOM FOR MORE OFTEN ACCESSED OBJECTS VIA AN LRU (LEAST RECENTLY USED) ALGORITHM. MAXIMUM OBJECT SIZE IS 10GB. TO USE THE SERVICE WITH LARGER OBJECTS, CUSTOMERS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE A WRITTEN AUTHORIZATION FROM AZION. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Edge Caching will be billed according to the (a) Total Data Transferred; (b) Requests; and (c) Real-Time Purge Operations, according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**Edge Firewall:** designed for Customers to build and run their firewall rules at the Edge of the network, closest to users and devices. Each Edge Firewall can be linked to multiple domains, which in turn are accessible by users and devices. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Edge Firewall will be billed according to the volumes consumed in its modules.\n\n**Edge Functions:** designed to run the function's code on Azion's Edge, triggered by a request from the user or device, without the need of Customer provisioning or managing the underlying infrastructure. The function's code must receive 3 parameters: (a) the request's handler, (b) the reponse's handler, and (c) a JSON containing the variables parameterization. The function's code can be used to manipulate or transform the request or response. The created function must be associated to an Edge Application or Edge Firewall, where it can be parametrized by and argument formatted in JSON containing the function's variables. The trigger carrying the conditions to execute the function must be configured on the Edge Application or Edge Firewall associated to the function. Each request that comply with the configured runtime conditions is considered an Invocation which triggers the function's executions. AZION MAY CEASE, WITHOUT PREVIOUS NOTICE, THE FUNCTION'S EXECUTION: (A) CONSUMING MORE THAN THE MAXIMUM MEMORY DEFINED, (B) EXECUTING FOR LONGER THAN THE MAXIMUM DEFINED. AZION MAY REMOVE FUNCTIONS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN EXECUTED FOR MORE THAN THREE (3) MONTHS. CUSTOMER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN CONTENT, INCLUDING: (A) THE CODE'S PERFORMANCE, (B) THE LICENSE FOR USE OF A THIRD PARTY CODE OR THE RESPECT TO THE TERMS OF USE, AND (C) THE SECURITY OF THE SOURCE CODE USED. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Edge Functions will be billed considering (a) Compute Time and (b) Invocations, according to the volume consumed.\n\n**Edge Pulse:** designed to monitor, in real time, the performance and quality of users' access to the customer's web applications. Information such as response time when accessing users can be collected, in addition to information from the servers used to respond to the user's request. To activate it, you need to copy the Edge Pulse tag and insert it into the desired HTML pages. In doing so, the Customer declares himself authorized by its users to collect and process the information described above. The data collected may be used by Azion to improve performance and reliability in accessing Edge Applications. AZION IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR: (A) USE THAT WILL BE GIVEN BY THE CUSTOMER TO THE COLLECTED DATA; (B) THE RIGHT THAT THE CUSTOMER HAS TO COLLECT DATA FROM ITS USERS, BECAUSE BY INSERTING THE PULSE TAG IN ITS PAGES WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY AUTHORIZING AZION TO COLLECT THIS INFORMATION. (C) TAG REMOVAL FROM YOUR PAGES IN CASE OF PRODUCT WITHDRAWAL. Azion is committed to not collect any confidential or personal information from its users and also to the correct application of the information collected to constantly improve its delivery algorithms with the clear objective of guaranteeing the best possible experience for those who access our Edge Network. The usage of Edge Pulse must follow the guidelines provided in the product documentation. This way it will guarantee that its execution will be exclusively asynchronous, in other words, it will not impact the loading time and will not interfere in the internal structures of the page where it is inserted. Information related to user navigation will be made available to Customers through Real-Time Events and Data Streaming. \n\n**Image Processor:** an Edge Application module designed to optimize and dynamically manipulate images, and includes the following features: (1) optimization; (2) cutting; (3) resizing; (4) format conversion, and (5) applying filters such as blurring, noise, watermark, and others. The formats supported are JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP and ICO. Images are manipulated through Query String parameters sent in the request. Image optimization is the process of reducing the image file size, whenever possible, minimizing the quality losses noticeable in the image derived from the optimization process. Images may be delivered in a different file format other than the original, according to users’ access browser, in an effort to improve the delivery (ex: webp). There are no guarantee gains from the optimization process, and customers are tasked with monitoring the average gain from using the service. CUSTOMERS ARE HEREBY ADVISED THAT THE IMAGE OPTIMIZATION PROCESS ALTERS THE CONTENT DELIVERED TO END USERS AND MAY RESULT IN CHANGES TO THE VISUAL QUALITY OF THE IMAGE. AT ANY TIME AND WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE, AZION MAY UPDATE THE OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS AND SUCH CHANGES MAY ALTER THE CONTENTS DELIVERED AND THE OPTIMIZATION EFFICIENCY. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Image Processor will be billed considering the Images Processed according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**Intelligent DNS:** designed to provide an authoritative DNS service with support to standard QTYPES such as: A, AAAA, ANAME, CAA, CNAME, MX, NS, PTR, SRV and TXT. To adopt our product, you will need to change your appointment at the domain registrars where you manage your domain so that it starts using Azion name servers. The customer is responsible for renewing their domain names as well as ensuring the correct configuration of their zones, records and responses that they wish to provide through the DNS service. Therefore, Azion is not responsible for any failure to update these records. Azion is authorized to remove zones that are not being used. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Intelligent DNS will be billed considering (a) the total number of Hosted Zones, and (b) the total number of queries answered in a given period (Standard Queries).\n\n**L2 Caching:** designed as an add-on to Edge Caching to provide an additional cache layer between the origin of the Customer and Azion’s Edge, minimizing the volume of requests and traffic to the origin, in cases where it applies. The service has the following features: (1) content cache functionality with TTL equal to or greater than 30 days (2592000 seconds); (2) Real-Time Purge tool; (3) improved edge access to cached content by using persistent hash algorithms. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, L2 Caching will be billed considering (a) Data Transferred and (b) Storage.\n\n**Live Ingest:** designed to receive Live Streaming signals and distribute them using Edge Applications. Live streams must be ingested through the RTMP protocol and authenticated via username and password using an Azion-approved encoder. To enhance streaming availability, we recommend setting up two RTMP endpoints, a primary and a backup one, in different geographical areas. The service includes a dynamic packaging feature to convert the delivery format into HLS so it may be distributed by the Edge Applications in HTTP. Customer’s encoder must follow the recommendations regarding configuration, formats and codecs supported by the service and approved by Azion. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Live Ingest will be billed considering the Data Ingested according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**Load Balancer:** an Edge Application module designed to balance customers’ HTTP/HTTPS traffic between origins distributed across multiple datacenter, service providers (multi-cloud) or in the same datacenter. It eliminates or reduces the need for dedicated hardware or software and lowers the impact of local failures on global content availability. Includes access to the following features: (1) Round-Robin balancing, Least Connections and IP Hash; (2) assignment of different weights to origins; (3) primary or backup (standby) server configuration; (4) manipulation of errors and exceptions in case of timeouts when connecting to or getting a response from the origin, or in case the origin’s response error is a supported by Azion. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Load Balancer will be billed considering the Data Transferred according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**Network Layer Protection:** Edge Firewall module designed to control and block access to content and applications directly on Azion's Edge. Access control and blocking can be done by IP address or network (CIDR), geolocation (country of access) and ASN. Azion uses databases from external suppliers to identify geolocation and ASN based on the User's IP address, which may be inaccurate in some situations, with the Customer being responsible for the use of this access restriction functionality. AZION PROVIDES ACCESS CONTROL MECHANISMS BASED ON THE BEST EFFORT, BUT THAT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE UNTRANSPONIBLE RESTRICTIONS AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS. THE CUSTOMER MUST RESTRICT ACCESS BY IP ADDRESS TO OBTAIN THE BEST LEVEL OF CONTROL AND AZION RECOMMENDS THE COMBINATION OF MULTIPLE TECHNIQUES. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Network Layer Protection will be billed considering Requests according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**Origin Shield:** designed as an add-on to the Network Layer Protection module to assist in protecting the Customer's origin, Origin Shield has the following features: (a) access via Real-Time Manager and its API to the complete list of IP/CIDR addresses used by Azion's Products to communicate with the Customer's origins; (b) ensuring that new IP/CIDR addresses added to the Azion network will remain on hold for a period of 7 calendar days, from their inclusion in the Origin Shield listing until they start communicating with the Customer's origins; (c) email notification to the Customer's registered addresses, whenever there is a change in the IP/CIDR addresses used by the Azion network; and (d) discrimination in the History of the Real-Time Manager of the IP/CIDR addresses included and removed in each update of the listing. It is the Customer's responsibility to obtain the list of Origin Shield addresses through the Real-Time Manager or its API and to grant access at their origin, as well as to keep updated the list of email addresses that must receive notification from Azion. Azion will send notification emails, but has no way of guaranteeing that the message will reach the Customer's Mailbox and any error returns from the Customer's email system may result in the message being discarded. It is up to the Customer to keep their Firewall and access policies updated to allow the connection from Azion's servers. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Origin Shield will be billed considering a recurring Origin Shield Fee.\n\n**Real-Time Events:** designed to enable Customers to analyze Azion's Product and Services' events via web interface, searching events in different Data Sources, with different time filters. AZION WILL USE ALL COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS TO RETAIN THE EVENTS FOR 7 DAYS AND MAKE THEM AVAILABLE TO OUR CUSTOMERS WITH A DELAY LOWER THAN 3 MINUTES. IN CASE OF PEAK ACCESS, ATTACKS OR EXTERNAL FACTORS, THE DELAY MAY BE SUPERIOR THAN THE FORESEEN. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Real-Time Events will be billed considering (a) Data Gathered; (b) Real-Time Events Queries, according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**Real-Time Metrics:** designed to enable Customers to monitor Azion's Product and Services key performance indicators via web interface or API.

    "body": "\n*Last updated: May 15, 2019.*\n\nThe following definitions related to Products and Services, billing methods, and other terms apply to the purchase and use of Azion Products and Services. We are constantly looking to improve our solutions. Consequently, this document may be updated and you should always look at its latest version.\n\nAll Azion products and services are offered as Cloud Services and available through specific Internet communication protocols. Our servers are located at various points of presence (POPs) across the world. Azion Products and Services are orchestrated and configured via the Real-Time Manager interface or its APIs. Products and Services are billed according to their use, type of contract, and prices, as defined in the Customer Agreement.\n\n## 1. Products and Services\n\n**Adaptive Delivery:** an Edge Applications' module designed to detect devices based on the User Agent String sent by users and allowing the delivery of content to different devices and formats from the same URL. The product’s efficiency depends on the proper configuration of the regular expressions that make it possible to map the types of devices and corresponding User Agent Strings. Customer is responsible for keeping and updating the list of device groups, which may include the lists predefined by Azion. Customer’s origin server has the duty of delivering the most appropriate content for each type of device, according to the detection conducted by Adaptive Delivery reported to the origin server via a customizable HTTP header field. Content changes may be cached in Azion’s Edge Servers, according to the defined configurations. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Adaptive Delivery will be billed considering the Data Transferred according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**Application Acceleration:** an Edge Applications' module designed to accelerate web applications and APIs. It includes access to protocol optimization features, advanced caching rules (Advanced Cache Key) which allows granular caching with minimum TTL of 0 seconds, segmentation and caching policies based on criteria such as name/value of Cookies and Query Strings, in addition to features such as Rules Engine, Bypass Cache, KeepAlive, Forward Cookies, POST Cache, among others. HTTP GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE and OPTIONS methods available. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Application Acceleration will be billed considering the Data Transferred according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**Caching (CDN):** an Edge Applications' module designed to deliver web contents of all formats and types, including HTTP Live Streaming (HLS), via the HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1, and HTTP/2 protocols, along with support for the HTTP GET, HEAD and OPTIONS methods.

The Customer will choose which data to be collected and, by doing so, automatically declare to be authorized to collect all the selected data. AZION DOES NOT HOLD RESPONSIBILITY BY: (A) THE USAGE OF THE DATA BY THE CUSTOMER, (B) THE CUSTOMER RIGHTS TO COLLECT THEIR USER'S DATA. The collected data is sent to the customer's infrastructure using the protocol chosen in the Real-Time Manager interface or API by the Customer, formatted in JSON in a configurable template. The data is dispatched in blocks of 2 thousand requests separated by \\n, or 60 seconds, whichever happens first. Azion will use all commercially reasonable efforts to send all the data to the Customer's infrastructure, or its suppliers, in real time or with a delay lower than 3 minutes. However, in the case of access peaks, attacks or external causes, the delay can be greater. THE CUSTOMER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE AVAILABILITY OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO RECEIVE THE DATA AND, IN CASE OF UNAVAILABILITY, AZION CAN DISCARD THE DATA. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Data Streaming will be billed considering the (a) Data Streaming Requests and (b) Data Streamed, according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**DDoS Protection:** DDoS Protection will be provided exclusively under the terms available at Azion [DDoS Documentation](https://www.azion.com/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-firewall/ddos-protection/) (“Guidelines”).

Attacks exceeding the volumes purchased may be immediately blocked until the attack ends. To be eligible for a Service Credit (a) the DDoS attack must result in a bill that exceed the double of the average monthly consumption in the previous six (6) months, excluding the months in which a DDoS attack took place; (b) in the event of an impossibility to calculate the average monthly consumption in the previous six months, the average consumption volume in the available months will be used as basis; (c) Customer must notify the Azion Technical Support about an attack underway by registering a Support Ticket; (d) the Azion Technical Support must have determined the reported DDoS attack is a legitimate attack; and (e) credit applications must be sent by Customer within 30 days after the disputed service bill is closed. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Managed DDoS Protection will be billed at (a) a monthly set fee according to the protection limit purchased (Protection Fee) and, additionally, (b) a fee per total GB traffic (Total Data Transferred). By purchasing our Managed DDoS Protection service, the Customer will be required to pay for a minimum of twelve (12) months of the service. In the event Customer’s average bill exceeds the volume purchased, or in case more than two credits are applied for in a given calendar year, Azion will be entitled to require Customer to pay an additional DDoS Protection Fee for each attack suffered. Only a single credit may be applied each month, even when several attacks take place in the same month. Credits are to be issued as a credit note instead of a revised bill. AZION IS CONSTANTLY SEEKING TO UPGRADE OUR SECURITY MECHANISMS TO MAKE OUR PROTECTION SYSTEMS MORE EFFECTIVE AND REDUCE THE RISK OF IMPACTS TO CUSTOMER APPLICATIONS. HOWEVER, THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES THE DDOS SERVICE WILL BE ABLE TO PREVENT ALL POSSIBLE ATTACKS OR THREATS. CUSTOMERS SHOULD KEEP SECURITY CONTROLS AT THEIR ORIGINS AS WELL. CUSTOMERS ASSUME ALL RISKS OF SERVICE UNAVAILABILITY OWING TO RULES POORLY CONFIGURED IN THE SERVICE.\n\n**Digital Certificates:** this service brokers and obtains the issuance of shared SSL certificates of the Domain Validated (DV) type from a Certification Authority (CA) chosen by Azion, to be used solely for the Edge Application service. Customers must be able to prove their authority over the desired domains by following the technical procedures set by the CA. SSL certificates and private keys are shared among multiple Customers and will be held exclusively by Azion. Under no circumstances whatsoever will certificates and/or private keys be sent to the Customers. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Digital Certificates will be billed considering the number of Digital Certificates according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**Edge Applications:** designed to enable Customers to build and execute their own serverless applications at the Edge of the network, closer to users and devices. It is the ideal solution for applications that require low latency response time or real-time data processing. Each Each Edge Application can be assigned to multiple domains which can be accessed by users and devices. To guarantee the proper working of the service, Azion may enable, disable or modify services, POPs, IPs address, servers, any equipment or Customer content, without previous notice, always aiming the maintenance or performance improvement and availability. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Edge Applications will be billed considering the number of Edge Applications, according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**Edge Firewall:** an Edge Applications' module designed to control and block access to content and applications directly in Azion’s Edge Servers. Access can be controlled and blocked via IP address or network, geolocation (country of access), ASN, HTTP Referer and Secure Token. Azion uses databases from external suppliers to detect the geolocation based on users’ IP address. Given such databases may be inaccurate at times, Customer is responsible for the use of this access restriction feature. Blocking via HTTP Referer is based on information provided by the browser or application requesting the content and may have been maliciously manipulated by a user to obtain undue access. Therefore, the Customer is responsible for this type of access control. Secure Token is an access validation mechanism based on the MD5 hash, and the Customer is responsible for the security of the secret used to generate the hash. AZION PROVIDES ACCESS CONTROL MECHANISMS BASED ON BEST EFFORTS. HOWEVER, SUCH MECHANISMS ARE NOT AN INSURMOUNTABLE RESTRICTION AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS. CUSTOMER SHOULD RESTRICT ACCESS VIA IP ADDRESS TO OBTAIN THE BEST LEVEL OF CONTROL AND AZION RECOMMENDS USING A COMBINATION OF MULTIPLE TECHNIQUES. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Edge Firewall will be billed considering the Requests according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**Edge Functions:** an Edge Applications' module designed to run the function's code on Azion's Edge Servers, triggered by a request from the user or device, without the need of Customer provisioning or managing the underlying infrastructure. The function's code must receive 3 parameters: (a) the request's handler, (b) the reponse's handler, and (c) a JSON containing the variables parameterization. The function's code can be used to manipulate or transform the request or response. The created function must be associated to an Edge Application, where it must be parametrized by and argument formatted in JSON containing the function's variables. The trigger carrying the conditions to execute the function must be configured on the Edge Application associated to the function. Each request that comply with the configured runtime conditions is considered an Invocation which triggers the function's executions. AZION MAY CEASE, WITHOUT PREVIOUS NOTICE, THE FUNCTION'S EXECUTION: (A) CONSUMING MORE THAN THE MAXIMUM MEMORY DEFINED, (B) EXECUTING FOR LONGER THAN THE MAXIMUM DEFINED. AZION MAY REMOVE FUNCTIONS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN EXECUTED FOR MORE THAN THREE (3) MONTHS. CUSTOMER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN CONTENT, INCLUDING: (A) THE CODE'S PERFORMANCE, (B) THE LICENSE FOR USE OF A THIRD PARTY CODE OR THE RESPECT TO THE TERMS OF USE, AND (C) THE SECURITY OF THE SOURCE CODE USED. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Edge Functions will be billed considering (a) Compute Time and (b) Invocations, according to the volume consumed.\n\n**Image Optimization:** an Edge Applications' module designed to optimize and dynamically manipulate images, and includes the following features: (1) optimization; (2) cutting; (3) resizing; (4) format conversion, and (5) applying filters such as blurring, noise, watermark, and others. The formats supported are JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP and ICO. Images are manipulated through Query String parameters sent in the request. Image optimization is the process of reducing the image file size, whenever possible, minimizing the quality losses noticeable in the image derived from the optimization process. Images may be delivered in a different file format other than the original, according to users’ access browser, in an effort to improve the delivery (ex: webp). There are no guarantee gains from the optimization process, and customers are tasked with monitoring the average gain from using the service. CUSTOMERS ARE HEREBY ADVISED THAT THE IMAGE OPTIMIZATION PROCESS ALTERS THE CONTENT DELIVERED TO END USERS AND MAY RESULT IN CHANGES TO THE VISUAL QUALITY OF THE IMAGE. AT ANY TIME AND WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE, AZION MAY UPDATE THE OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS AND SUCH CHANGES MAY ALTER THE CONTENTS DELIVERED AND THE OPTIMIZATION EFFICIENCY. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Image Optimization will be billed considering the Images Processed according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**Live Ingest:** designed to receive Live Streaming signals and distribute them using Edge Applications. Live streams must be ingested through the RTMP protocol and authenticated via username and password using an Azion-approved encoder. To enhance streaming availability, we recommend setting up two RTMP endpoints, a primary and a backup one, in different geographical areas. The service includes a dynamic packaging feature to convert the delivery format into HLS so it may be distributed by the Edge Applications in HTTP. Customer’s encoder must follow the recommendations regarding configuration, formats and codecs supported by the service and approved by Azion. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Live Ingest will be billed considering the Data Ingested according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**Load Balancer:** an Edge Applications' module designed to balance customers’ HTTP/HTTPS traffic between origins distributed across multiple datacenter, service providers (multi-cloud) or in the same datacenter.

THE CUSTOMER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS CONTENT, INCLUDING: (A) THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CODE YOU USE; (B) LICENSING TO USE THIRD PARTY CODE OR RESPECT TO THE TERMS OF USE OF IT; AND (C) THE SECURITY OF THE SOURCE CODE YOU USE. Unless specified otherwise in the Customer Agreement or any documents attached thereto, Edge Functions will be charged for (a) Compute Time and (b) Invocations, according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**Edge Pulse:** designed to monitor, in real time, the performance and quality of users' access to the customer's web applications. Information such as response time when accessing users can be collected, in addition to information from the servers used to respond to the user's request. To activate it, you need to copy the Edge Pulse tag and insert it into the desired HTML pages. In doing so, the customer declares himself authorized by its users to collect and process the information described above. The data collected may be used by Azion to improve performance and reliability in accessing Edge Applications. AZION IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR: (A) USE THAT WILL BE GIVEN BY THE CUSTOMER TO THE COLLECTED DATA; (B) THE RIGHT THAT THE CUSTOMER HAS TO COLLECT DATA FROM ITS USERS, BECAUSE BY INSERTING THE PULSE TAG IN ITS PAGES WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY AUTHORIZING AZION TO COLLECT THIS INFORMATION. (C) TAG REMOVAL FROM YOUR PAGES IN CASE OF PRODUCT WITHDRAWAL. Azion is committed to not collect any confidential or personal information from its users and also to the correct application of the information collected to constantly improve its delivery algorithms with the clear objective of guaranteeing the best possible experience for those who access our Edge Network. The usage of Edge Pulse must follow the guidelines provided in the product documentation. This way it will guarantee that its execution will be exclusively asynchronous, in other words, it will not impact the loading time and will not interfere in the internal structures of the page where it is inserted. Information related to user navigation will be made available to customers through reports in Real-Time Events and Data Streaming. \n\n**Image Processor:** Edge Application module designed to dynamically optimize and manipulate images, including the following features: (1) optimization; (2) cutting; (3) resizing; (4) format conversion and (5) application of filters such as blur, noise, watermark, amongst others. The supported formats are JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP and ICO. The manipulation of images is performed through Query String parameters sent in the request. Image optimization consists of the process of reducing the size of the image file, when possible, seeking to minimize the perceived loss of quality of the image, resulting from the optimization process. The image may be delivered in a file format different from the original, according to the User Access Browser, seeking better delivery optimization (e.g.: webp). There is no guarantee of gain in the optimization process and the customer is responsible for monitoring the average gain resulting from the use of the service. THE CUSTOMER MUST BE AWARE THAT THE IMAGE OPTIMIZATION PROCESS CHANGES THE CONTENT DELIVERED TO THE END USER, MAY RESULT IN DIFFERENCES IN THE VISUAL QUALITY OF THE IMAGE. AZION MAY, AT ANY TIME AND WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE, UPDATE THE OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS, RESULTING IN DIFFERENCES IN THE CONTENT DELIVERED AND IN THE OPTIMIZATION EFFICIENCY. Unless specified otherwise in the Customer Agreement or any documents attached thereto, the Image Processor will be charged for Images Processed according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**Intelligent DNS:** designed to be an authoritative DNS, with the ability to meet the main QTYPES required by the market, such as: A, AAAA, ANAME, CAA, CNAME, MX, NS, PTR, SRV and TXT. To adopt our product, you will need to change your appointment at the registration agency where you hired your domain so that it starts using Azion servers. The customer is responsible for renewing their domain names as well as ensuring the correct configuration of their zones, records and responses that they wish to provide through the DNS service. Therefore, Azion is not responsible for any failure to update these records. Azion undertakes not to sell, distribute, reveal or make public any customer information, except in the event of a written judicial request, or in the case of illegal acts by the customer, as well as, but not limited to: fraud, content defamatory etc. Azion is authorized to remove zones created in its database that are not being pointed out by any registration server. The cancellation of the DNS service contract will occur when the customer removes all zones from his account and disables the product in the subscriptions area in Real-Time Manager. Azion will also make a final charge, referring to the hosted zones and the consultations attended until the moment of disconnection. Azion does not make any kind of promise in relation to the service offered to its customers and will not be responsible for any dispute made by customers. In no event will Azion be liable for any direct, indirect, accidental, consequential or any other damage. We cannot take action against abusive material until it is brought to our attention. Unless specified otherwise in the Customer Agreement or any documents attached thereto, the Intelligent DNS will be charged for (a) the total number of Hosted Zones, and (b) the total number of queries answered in a given period (Standard Queries).\n\n**L2 Caching:** add-on of the Edge Caching module designed to be an additional cache layer between the origin of the Customer and Azion’s Edge, minimizing the volume of requests to the origin, in cases where it applies.

Unless specified otherwise in the Customer Agreement or any documents attached thereto, L2 Caching will be charged for the metrics (a) Data Transferred and (b) Storage.\n\n**Live Ingest:** designed to receive ingestion of Live Streaming signals and to distribute them through Edge Applications. The ingestion of the Live transmission must be performed using the RTMP protocol, authenticated using a user and password and using an encoder approved by Azion. To improve the availability of the transmission, it is recommended to configure two RTMP Endpoints, a Primary one and a Backup one, in different geographic regions, in addition to the player configurations suggested by Azion. The service provides the functionality of Dynamic Packaging, to convert the delivery format to HLS, so that it can be distributed by Edge Applications in HTTP. The Customer's encoder must respect the configuration recommendations, formats and codecs supported by the service and approved by Azion. Unless specified otherwise in the Customer Agreement or any documents attached thereto, Live Ingest will be charged for Data Ingested according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**Load Balancer:** Edge Application module designed to balance customer traffic between sources distributed across multiple datacenters, service providers (multi-cloud) or in the same datacenter, eliminating or minimizing the need for dedicated hardware or software and reducing the impact of local failures in global availability of content.

    "body": "\n*Last updated: March 30, 2023.*\n\nThe following definitions related to Products and Services, billing methods, and other terms apply to the purchase and use of Azion Products and Services. We are constantly looking to improve our solutions. Consequently, this document may be updated and you should always look at its latest version.\n\nAll Azion products and services are offered as Edge Services and available through specific Internet communication protocols. Our servers are located at various points of presence (POPs) across the world. Azion Products and Services are orchestrated and configured via the Real-Time Manager interface or its APIs. Products and Services are billed according to their use, type of contract, and prices, as defined in the Customer Agreement.\n\n## 1\\. Products and Services\n\n**Application Acceleration:** an Edge Application module designed to accelerate web applications and APIs. It includes access to protocol optimization features, advanced caching rules (Advanced Cache Key) which allows granular caching with minimum TTL of 0 seconds, segmentation and caching policies based on criteria such as name/value of Cookies and Query Strings, in addition to features such as Rules Engine, Bypass Cache, KeepAlive, Forward Cookies, POST Cache, among others. HTTP GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE and OPTIONS methods available. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Application Acceleration will be billed considering the Data Transferred according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**Data Streaming:** designed to collect data from the Edge Applications or any other Azion's Products and Services. The Customer will choose which data to be collected and, by doing so, automatically declare to be authorized to collect all the selected data. AZION DOES NOT HOLD RESPONSIBILITY BY: (A) THE USAGE OF THE DATA BY THE CUSTOMER, (B) THE CUSTOMER RIGHTS TO COLLECT THEIR USER'S DATA. The collected data is sent to the customer's infrastructure using the protocol chosen in the Real-Time Manager interface or API by the Customer, formatted in NDJSON (Newline Delimited JSON) in a configurable template. The data is dispatched in blocks of 2 thousand requests separated by \\\\n (Newline), or 60 seconds, whichever happens first. Azion will use all commercially reasonable efforts to send all the data to the Customer's infrastructure, or its suppliers, in real time or with a delay lower than 3 minutes. However, in the case of access peaks, attacks or external causes, the delay can be greater. THE CUSTOMER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE AVAILABILITY OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO RECEIVE THE DATA AND, IN CASE OF UNAVAILABILITY, AZION CAN DISCARD THE DATA. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Data Streaming will be billed considering the (a) Data Streaming Requests and (b) Data Streamed, according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**DDoS Protection:** DDoS Protection will be provided exclusively under the terms available at https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/ddos-protection/ (“Guidelines”). By using Azion, Customer (i) authorizes Azion to impose the technical measures available on the Azion platform to control or mitigate DDoS attacks, even though such measures may result in performance degradation, and (ii) acknowledges that the Service Level Agreement (\"SLA\") does not apply while a DDoS attack is underway. The following Azion DDoS Protection service options are available: (i) DDoS Protection - 5 Gbps: includes the following features: (a) network flow analysis (layers 3 and 4); (b) detection of the most common DDoS attacks, network and transport layers, and (c) mitigation of the most common DDoS attacks, network and transport layers, up to the limit of 5 Gbps; (ii) DDoS Protection - 20 Gbps, includes all of the DDoS Protection - 5 Gbps features plus: (a) detection of more sophisticated DDoS attacks; (b) cost protection via service credits, when applicable; (c) mitigation of larger DDoS attacks up to 20 Gbps; (iii) DDoS Protection - 50 Gbps extends the protection against DDoS attacks up to 50 Gbps; and (iv) DDoS Protection - Unlimited, for unlimited protection against DDoS attacks, the mitigation may use the entire Azion network, in addition to 24x7 access to our Security Response Team (SRT) upon the purchase our Support Mission Critical service. Attacks exceeding the volumes purchased may be immediately blocked until the attack ends. To be eligible for a Service Credit (a) the DDoS attack must result in a bill that exceed the double of the average monthly consumption in the previous six (6) months, excluding the months in which a DDoS attack took place; (b) in the event of an impossibility to calculate the average monthly consumption in the previous six months, the average consumption volume in the available months will be used as basis; (c) Customer must notify the Azion Technical Support about an attack underway by registering a Support Ticket; (d) the Azion Technical Support must have determined the reported DDoS attack is a legitimate attack; and (e) credit applications must be sent by Customer within 30 days after the disputed service bill is closed. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Managed DDoS Protection will be billed at (a) a monthly set fee according to the protection limit purchased (Protection Fee) and, additionally, (b) a fee per total GB traffic (Total Data Transferred). By purchasing our Managed DDoS Protection service, the Customer will be required to pay for a minimum of twelve (12) months of the service. In the event Customer’s average bill exceeds the volume purchased, or in case more than two credits are applied for in a given calendar year, Azion will be entitled to require Customer to pay an additional DDoS Protection Fee for each attack suffered. Only a single credit may be applied each month, even when several attacks take place in the same month. Credits are to be issued as a credit note instead of a revised bill. AZION IS CONSTANTLY SEEKING TO UPGRADE OUR SECURITY MECHANISMS TO MAKE OUR PROTECTION SYSTEMS MORE EFFECTIVE AND REDUCE THE RISK OF IMPACTS TO CUSTOMER APPLICATIONS. HOWEVER, THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES THE DDOS SERVICE WILL BE ABLE TO PREVENT ALL POSSIBLE ATTACKS OR THREATS. CUSTOMERS SHOULD KEEP SECURITY CONTROLS AT THEIR ORIGINS AS WELL. CUSTOMERS ASSUME ALL RISKS OF SERVICE UNAVAILABILITY OWING TO RULES POORLY CONFIGURED IN THE SERVICE.\n\n**Digital Certificates:** this service brokers and obtains the issuance of shared SSL certificates of the Domain Validated (DV) type from a Certification Authority (CA) chosen by Azion, to be used solely for the Edge Application service.

To use this service, Customers need to store the original version of their Content in an origin web server with HTTP access. THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES THAT CONTENTS (OBJECTS) WILL BE AVAILABLE IN CACHE THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE TIME-TO-LIVE (TTL) CONFIGURED BY THE CUSTOMER. AZION MAKES THE NECESSARY INVESTMENTS TO KEEP DATA CACHED FOR THE CLOSEST TIME TO THAT CONFIGURED BY CUSTOMERS, HOWEVER, LEAST ACCESSED OBJECTS MAY BE AUTOMATICALLY DELETED FROM THE CACHE TO MAKE ROOM FOR MORE OFTEN ACCESSED OBJECTS VIA AN LRU (LEAST RECENTLY USED) ALGORITHM. MAXIMUM OBJECT SIZE IS 10GB. TO USE THE SERVICE WITH LARGER OBJECTS, CUSTOMERS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE A WRITTEN AUTHORIZATION FROM AZION. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Edge Caching will be billed according to the (a) Total Data Transferred; (b) Requests; and (c) Real-Time Purge Operations, according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**Edge Firewall:** designed for Customers to build and run their firewall rules at the Edge of the network, closest to users and devices.

The function's code must receive 3 parameters: (a) the request's handler, (b) the reponse's handler, and (c) a JSON containing the variables parameterization. The function's code can be used to manipulate or transform the request or response. The created function must be associated to an Edge Application or Edge Firewall, where it can be parametrized by and argument formatted in JSON containing the function's variables. The trigger carrying the conditions to execute the function must be configured on the Edge Application or Edge Firewall associated to the function. Each request that comply with the configured runtime conditions is considered an Invocation which triggers the function's executions. AZION MAY CEASE, WITHOUT PREVIOUS NOTICE, THE FUNCTION'S EXECUTION: (A) CONSUMING MORE THAN THE MAXIMUM MEMORY DEFINED, (B) EXECUTING FOR LONGER THAN THE MAXIMUM DEFINED. AZION MAY REMOVE FUNCTIONS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN EXECUTED FOR MORE THAN THREE (3) MONTHS. CUSTOMER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN CONTENT, INCLUDING: (A) THE CODE'S PERFORMANCE, (B) THE LICENSE FOR USE OF A THIRD PARTY CODE OR THE RESPECT TO THE TERMS OF USE, AND (C) THE SECURITY OF THE SOURCE CODE USED. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Edge Functions will be billed considering (a) Compute Time and (b) Invocations, according to the volume consumed.\n\n**Edge Orchestrator**\\: designed to enable the Customer to orchestrate Edge Services on their own Edge Nodes, accessible through an agent installed on the Customer’s nodes (servers or compatible IoT devices) and managed through a web interface (the Real-Time Manager) and API. These interfaces allow the registration and configuration of the Customer’s Edge Nodes as well as the creation and customization of Edge Services that can be orchestrated in real time on the pre-registered Edge Nodes. The services to be orchestrated are based on configuration files and scripts to be provided by the Customer, and will run on the devices where the agent is installed. Except as otherwise provided in the Customer Agreement or any documents attached to it, Edge Orchestrator will be billed considering &nbsp;(a) Orchestrated Edge Nodes and (b) Total Orchestrated Data.\n\n**Edge Pulse:** designed to monitor, in real time, the performance and quality of users' access to the customer's web applications. Information such as response time when accessing users can be collected, in addition to information from the servers used to respond to the user's request. To activate it, you need to copy the Edge Pulse tag and insert it into the desired HTML pages. In doing so, the Customer declares himself authorized by its users to collect and process the information described above. The data collected may be used by Azion to improve performance and reliability in accessing Edge Applications. AZION IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR: (A) USE THAT WILL BE GIVEN BY THE CUSTOMER TO THE COLLECTED DATA; (B) THE RIGHT THAT THE CUSTOMER HAS TO COLLECT DATA FROM ITS USERS, BECAUSE BY INSERTING THE PULSE TAG IN ITS PAGES WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY AUTHORIZING AZION TO COLLECT THIS INFORMATION.

Azion is committed to not collect any confidential or personal information from its users and also to the correct application of the information collected to constantly improve its delivery algorithms with the clear objective of guaranteeing the best possible experience for those who access our Edge Network. The usage of Edge Pulse must follow the guidelines provided in the product documentation. This way it will guarantee that its execution will be exclusively asynchronous, in other words, it will not impact the loading time and will not interfere in the internal structures of the page where it is inserted. Information related to user navigation will be made available to Customers through Real-Time Events and Data Streaming.\n\n**Image Processor:** an Edge Application module designed to optimize and dynamically manipulate images, and includes the following features: (1) optimization; (2) cutting; (3) resizing; (4) format conversion, and (5) applying filters such as blurring, noise, watermark, and others. The formats supported are JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP and ICO. Images are manipulated through Query String parameters sent in the request. Image optimization is the process of reducing the image file size, whenever possible, minimizing the quality losses noticeable in the image derived from the optimization process. Images may be delivered in a different file format other than the original, according to users’ access browser, in an effort to improve the delivery (ex: webp). There are no guarantee gains from the optimization process, and customers are tasked with monitoring the average gain from using the service. CUSTOMERS ARE HEREBY ADVISED THAT THE IMAGE OPTIMIZATION PROCESS ALTERS THE CONTENT DELIVERED TO END USERS AND MAY RESULT IN CHANGES TO THE VISUAL QUALITY OF THE IMAGE. AT ANY TIME AND WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE, AZION MAY UPDATE THE OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS AND SUCH CHANGES MAY ALTER THE CONTENTS DELIVERED AND THE OPTIMIZATION EFFICIENCY. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Image Processor will be billed considering the Images Processed according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**Intelligent DNS:** designed to provide an authoritative DNS service with support to standard QTYPES such as: A, AAAA, ANAME, CAA, CNAME, MX, NS, PTR, SRV and TXT.

The customer is responsible for renewing their domain names as well as ensuring the correct configuration of their zones, records and responses that they wish to provide through the DNS service. Therefore, Azion is not responsible for any failure to update these records. Azion is authorized to remove zones that are not being used. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Intelligent DNS will be billed considering (a) the total number of Hosted Zones, and (b) the total number of queries answered in a given period (Standard Queries).\n\n**L2 Caching:** designed as an add-on to Edge Caching to provide an additional cache layer between the origin of the Customer and Azion’s Edge, minimizing the volume of requests and traffic to the origin, in cases where it applies. The service has the following features: (1) content cache functionality with TTL equal to or greater than 30 days (2592000 seconds); (2) Real-Time Purge tool; (3) improved edge access to cached content by using persistent hash algorithms. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, L2 Caching will be billed considering (a) Data Transferred and (b) Storage.\n\n**Load Balancer:** an Edge Application module designed to balance customers’ HTTP/HTTPS traffic between origins distributed across multiple datacenter, service providers (multi-cloud) or in the same datacenter. It eliminates or reduces the need for dedicated hardware or software and lowers the impact of local failures on global content availability. Includes access to the following features: (1) Round-Robin balancing, Least Connections and IP Hash; (2) assignment of different weights to origins; (3) primary or backup (standby) server configuration; (4) manipulation of errors and exceptions in case of timeouts when connecting to or getting a response from the origin, or in case the origin’s response error is a supported by Azion. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Load Balancer will be billed considering the Data Transferred according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**Network Layer Protection:** Edge Firewall module designed to control and block access to content and applications directly on Azion's Edge. Access control and blocking can be done by IP address or network (CIDR), geolocation (country of access) and ASN. Azion uses databases from external suppliers to identify geolocation and ASN based on the User's IP address, which may be inaccurate in some situations, with the Customer being responsible for the use of this access restriction functionality. AZION PROVIDES ACCESS CONTROL MECHANISMS BASED ON THE BEST EFFORT, BUT THAT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE UNTRANSPONIBLE RESTRICTIONS AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS. THE CUSTOMER MUST RESTRICT ACCESS BY IP ADDRESS TO OBTAIN THE BEST LEVEL OF CONTROL AND AZION RECOMMENDS THE COMBINATION OF MULTIPLE TECHNIQUES. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Network Layer Protection will be billed considering Requests according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**Origin Shield:** designed as an add-on to the Network Layer Protection module to assist in protecting the Customer's origin, Origin Shield has the following features: (a) access via Real-Time Manager and its API to the complete list of IP/CIDR addresses used by Azion's Products to communicate with the Customer's origins; (b) ensuring that new IP/CIDR addresses added to the Azion network will remain on hold for a period of 7 calendar days, from their inclusion in the Origin Shield listing until they start communicating with the Customer's origins; (c) email notification to the Customer's registered addresses, whenever there is a change in the IP/CIDR addresses used by the Azion network; and (d) discrimination in the History of the Real-Time Manager of the IP/CIDR addresses included and removed in each update of the listing. It is the Customer's responsibility to obtain the list of Origin Shield addresses through the Real-Time Manager or its API and to grant access at their origin, as well as to keep updated the list of email addresses that must receive notification from Azion. Azion will send notification emails, but has no way of guaranteeing that the message will reach the Customer's Mailbox and any error returns from the Customer's email system may result in the message being discarded. It is up to the Customer to keep their Firewall and access policies updated to allow the connection from Azion's servers. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Origin Shield will be billed considering a recurring Origin Shield Fee.\n\n**Real-Time Events:** designed to enable Customers to analyze Azion's Product and Services' events via web interface, searching events in different Data Sources, with different time filters.

    "body": "\n*Last updated: September 23, 2022.*\n\nThe following definitions related to Products and Services, billing methods, and other terms apply to the purchase and use of Azion Products and Services. We are constantly looking to improve our solutions. Consequently, this document may be updated and you should always look at its latest version.\n\nAll Azion products and services are offered as Edge Services and available through specific Internet communication protocols. Our servers are located at various points of presence (POPs) across the world. Azion Products and Services are orchestrated and configured via the Real-Time Manager interface or its APIs. Products and Services are billed according to their use, type of contract, and prices, as defined in the Customer Agreement.\n\n## 1. Products and Services\n\n**Adaptive Delivery:** an Edge Application module designed to detect devices based on the User Agent String sent by users and allowing the delivery of content to different devices and formats from the same URL. The product’s efficiency depends on the proper configuration of the regular expressions that make it possible to map the types of devices and corresponding User Agent Strings. Customer is responsible for keeping and updating the list of device groups, which may include the lists predefined by Azion. Customer’s origin server has the duty of delivering the most appropriate content for each type of device, according to the detection conducted by Adaptive Delivery reported to the origin server via a customizable HTTP header field. Content changes may be cached in Azion’s Edge, according to the defined configurations. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Adaptive Delivery will be billed considering the Data Transferred according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**Application Acceleration:** an Edge Application module designed to accelerate web applications and APIs. It includes access to protocol optimization features, advanced caching rules (Advanced Cache Key) which allows granular caching with minimum TTL of 0 seconds, segmentation and caching policies based on criteria such as name/value of Cookies and Query Strings, in addition to features such as Rules Engine, Bypass Cache, KeepAlive, Forward Cookies, POST Cache, among others. HTTP GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE and OPTIONS methods available. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Application Acceleration will be billed considering the Data Transferred according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**Data Streaming:** designed to collect data from the Edge Applications or any other Azion's Products and Services.

AZION DOES NOT HOLD RESPONSIBILITY BY: (A) THE USAGE OF THE DATA BY THE CUSTOMER, (B) THE CUSTOMER RIGHTS TO COLLECT THEIR USER'S DATA. The collected data is sent to the customer's infrastructure using the protocol chosen in the Real-Time Manager interface or API by the Customer, formatted in NDJSON (Newline Delimited JSON) in a configurable template. The data is dispatched in blocks of 2 thousand requests separated by \\n (Newline), or 60 seconds, whichever happens first. Azion will use all commercially reasonable efforts to send all the data to the Customer's infrastructure, or its suppliers, in real time or with a delay lower than 3 minutes. However, in the case of access peaks, attacks or external causes, the delay can be greater. THE CUSTOMER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE AVAILABILITY OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO RECEIVE THE DATA AND, IN CASE OF UNAVAILABILITY, AZION CAN DISCARD THE DATA. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Data Streaming will be billed considering the (a) Data Streaming Requests and (b) Data Streamed, according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**DDoS Protection:** DDoS Protection will be provided exclusively under the terms available at https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/ddos-protection/ (“Guidelines”).

By purchasing our Managed DDoS Protection service, the Customer will be required to pay for a minimum of twelve (12) months of the service. In the event Customer’s average bill exceeds the volume purchased, or in case more than two credits are applied for in a given calendar year, Azion will be entitled to require Customer to pay an additional DDoS Protection Fee for each attack suffered. Only a single credit may be applied each month, even when several attacks take place in the same month. Credits are to be issued as a credit note instead of a revised bill. AZION IS CONSTANTLY SEEKING TO UPGRADE OUR SECURITY MECHANISMS TO MAKE OUR PROTECTION SYSTEMS MORE EFFECTIVE AND REDUCE THE RISK OF IMPACTS TO CUSTOMER APPLICATIONS. HOWEVER, THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES THE DDOS SERVICE WILL BE ABLE TO PREVENT ALL POSSIBLE ATTACKS OR THREATS. CUSTOMERS SHOULD KEEP SECURITY CONTROLS AT THEIR ORIGINS AS WELL.

To use this service, Customers need to store the original version of their Content in an origin web server with HTTP access. THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES THAT CONTENTS (OBJECTS) WILL BE AVAILABLE IN CACHE THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE TIME-TO-LIVE (TTL) CONFIGURED BY THE CUSTOMER. AZION MAKES THE NECESSARY INVESTMENTS TO KEEP DATA CACHED FOR THE CLOSEST TIME TO THAT CONFIGURED BY CUSTOMERS, HOWEVER, LEAST ACCESSED OBJECTS MAY BE AUTOMATICALLY DELETED FROM THE CACHE TO MAKE ROOM FOR MORE OFTEN ACCESSED OBJECTS VIA AN LRU (LEAST RECENTLY USED) ALGORITHM. MAXIMUM OBJECT SIZE IS 10GB. TO USE THE SERVICE WITH LARGER OBJECTS, CUSTOMERS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE A WRITTEN AUTHORIZATION FROM AZION. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Edge Caching will be billed according to the (a) Total Data Transferred; (b) Requests; and (c) Real-Time Purge Operations, according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**Edge Firewall:** designed for Customers to build and run their firewall rules at the Edge of the network, closest to users and devices. Each Edge Firewall can be linked to multiple domains, which in turn are accessible by users and devices. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Edge Firewall will be billed according to the volumes consumed in its modules.\n\n**Edge Functions:** designed to run the function's code on Azion's Edge, triggered by a request from the user or device, without the need of Customer provisioning or managing the underlying infrastructure. The function's code must receive 3 parameters: (a) the request's handler, (b) the reponse's handler, and (c) a JSON containing the variables parameterization. The function's code can be used to manipulate or transform the request or response. The created function must be associated to an Edge Application or Edge Firewall, where it can be parametrized by and argument formatted in JSON containing the function's variables. The trigger carrying the conditions to execute the function must be configured on the Edge Application or Edge Firewall associated to the function. Each request that comply with the configured runtime conditions is considered an Invocation which triggers the function's executions. AZION MAY CEASE, WITHOUT PREVIOUS NOTICE, THE FUNCTION'S EXECUTION: (A) CONSUMING MORE THAN THE MAXIMUM MEMORY DEFINED, (B) EXECUTING FOR LONGER THAN THE MAXIMUM DEFINED. AZION MAY REMOVE FUNCTIONS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN EXECUTED FOR MORE THAN THREE (3) MONTHS. CUSTOMER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN CONTENT, INCLUDING: (A) THE CODE'S PERFORMANCE, (B) THE LICENSE FOR USE OF A THIRD PARTY CODE OR THE RESPECT TO THE TERMS OF USE, AND (C) THE SECURITY OF THE SOURCE CODE USED. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Edge Functions will be billed considering (a) Compute Time and (b) Invocations, according to the volume consumed.\n\n**Edge Pulse:** designed to monitor, in real time, the performance and quality of users' access to the customer's web applications. Information such as response time when accessing users can be collected, in addition to information from the servers used to respond to the user's request. To activate it, you need to copy the Edge Pulse tag and insert it into the desired HTML pages. In doing so, the Customer declares himself authorized by its users to collect and process the information described above. The data collected may be used by Azion to improve performance and reliability in accessing Edge Applications. AZION IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR: (A) USE THAT WILL BE GIVEN BY THE CUSTOMER TO THE COLLECTED DATA; (B) THE RIGHT THAT THE CUSTOMER HAS TO COLLECT DATA FROM ITS USERS, BECAUSE BY INSERTING THE PULSE TAG IN ITS PAGES WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY AUTHORIZING AZION TO COLLECT THIS INFORMATION. (C) TAG REMOVAL FROM YOUR PAGES IN CASE OF PRODUCT WITHDRAWAL. Azion is committed to not collect any confidential or personal information from its users and also to the correct application of the information collected to constantly improve its delivery algorithms with the clear objective of guaranteeing the best possible experience for those who access our Edge Network. The usage of Edge Pulse must follow the guidelines provided in the product documentation. This way it will guarantee that its execution will be exclusively asynchronous, in other words, it will not impact the loading time and will not interfere in the internal structures of the page where it is inserted. Information related to user navigation will be made available to Customers through Real-Time Events and Data Streaming. \n\n**Image Processor:** an Edge Application module designed to optimize and dynamically manipulate images, and includes the following features: (1) optimization; (2) cutting; (3) resizing; (4) format conversion, and (5) applying filters such as blurring, noise, watermark, and others. The formats supported are JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP and ICO. Images are manipulated through Query String parameters sent in the request. Image optimization is the process of reducing the image file size, whenever possible, minimizing the quality losses noticeable in the image derived from the optimization process. Images may be delivered in a different file format other than the original, according to users’ access browser, in an effort to improve the delivery (ex: webp). There are no guarantee gains from the optimization process, and customers are tasked with monitoring the average gain from using the service. CUSTOMERS ARE HEREBY ADVISED THAT THE IMAGE OPTIMIZATION PROCESS ALTERS THE CONTENT DELIVERED TO END USERS AND MAY RESULT IN CHANGES TO THE VISUAL QUALITY OF THE IMAGE. AT ANY TIME AND WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE, AZION MAY UPDATE THE OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS AND SUCH CHANGES MAY ALTER THE CONTENTS DELIVERED AND THE OPTIMIZATION EFFICIENCY. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Image Processor will be billed considering the Images Processed according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**Intelligent DNS:** designed to provide an authoritative DNS service with support to standard QTYPES such as: A, AAAA, ANAME, CAA, CNAME, MX, NS, PTR, SRV and TXT. To adopt our product, you will need to change your appointment at the domain registrars where you manage your domain so that it starts using Azion name servers. The customer is responsible for renewing their domain names as well as ensuring the correct configuration of their zones, records and responses that they wish to provide through the DNS service. Therefore, Azion is not responsible for any failure to update these records. Azion is authorized to remove zones that are not being used. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Intelligent DNS will be billed considering (a) the total number of Hosted Zones, and (b) the total number of queries answered in a given period (Standard Queries).\n\n**L2 Caching:** designed as an add-on to Edge Caching to provide an additional cache layer between the origin of the Customer and Azion’s Edge, minimizing the volume of requests and traffic to the origin, in cases where it applies. The service has the following features: (1) content cache functionality with TTL equal to or greater than 30 days (2592000 seconds); (2) Real-Time Purge tool; (3) improved edge access to cached content by using persistent hash algorithms. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, L2 Caching will be billed considering (a) Data Transferred and (b) Storage.\n\n**Live Ingest:** designed to receive Live Streaming signals and distribute them using Edge Applications. Live streams must be ingested through the RTMP protocol and authenticated via username and password using an Azion-approved encoder. To enhance streaming availability, we recommend setting up two RTMP endpoints, a primary and a backup one, in different geographical areas. The service includes a dynamic packaging feature to convert the delivery format into HLS so it may be distributed by the Edge Applications in HTTP. Customer’s encoder must follow the recommendations regarding configuration, formats and codecs supported by the service and approved by Azion. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Live Ingest will be billed considering the Data Ingested according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**Load Balancer:** an Edge Application module designed to balance customers’ HTTP/HTTPS traffic between origins distributed across multiple datacenter, service providers (multi-cloud) or in the same datacenter. It eliminates or reduces the need for dedicated hardware or software and lowers the impact of local failures on global content availability. Includes access to the following features: (1) Round-Robin balancing, Least Connections and IP Hash; (2) assignment of different weights to origins; (3) primary or backup (standby) server configuration; (4) manipulation of errors and exceptions in case of timeouts when connecting to or getting a response from the origin, or in case the origin’s response error is a supported by Azion. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Load Balancer will be billed considering the Data Transferred according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**Network Layer Protection:** Edge Firewall module designed to control and block access to content and applications directly on Azion's Edge. Access control and blocking can be done by IP address or network (CIDR), geolocation (country of access) and ASN. Azion uses databases from external suppliers to identify geolocation and ASN based on the User's IP address, which may be inaccurate in some situations, with the Customer being responsible for the use of this access restriction functionality. AZION PROVIDES ACCESS CONTROL MECHANISMS BASED ON THE BEST EFFORT, BUT THAT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE UNTRANSPONIBLE RESTRICTIONS AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS. THE CUSTOMER MUST RESTRICT ACCESS BY IP ADDRESS TO OBTAIN THE BEST LEVEL OF CONTROL AND AZION RECOMMENDS THE COMBINATION OF MULTIPLE TECHNIQUES. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Network Layer Protection will be billed considering Requests according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**Origin Shield:** designed as an add-on to the Network Layer Protection module to assist in protecting the Customer's origin, Origin Shield has the following features: (a) access via Real-Time Manager and its API to the complete list of IP/CIDR addresses used by Azion's Products to communicate with the Customer's origins; (b) ensuring that new IP/CIDR addresses added to the Azion network will remain on hold for a period of 7 calendar days, from their inclusion in the Origin Shield listing until they start communicating with the Customer's origins; (c) email notification to the Customer's registered addresses, whenever there is a change in the IP/CIDR addresses used by the Azion network; and (d) discrimination in the History of the Real-Time Manager of the IP/CIDR addresses included and removed in each update of the listing. It is the Customer's responsibility to obtain the list of Origin Shield addresses through the Real-Time Manager or its API and to grant access at their origin, as well as to keep updated the list of email addresses that must receive notification from Azion. Azion will send notification emails, but has no way of guaranteeing that the message will reach the Customer's Mailbox and any error returns from the Customer's email system may result in the message being discarded. It is up to the Customer to keep their Firewall and access policies updated to allow the connection from Azion's servers. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Origin Shield will be billed considering a recurring Origin Shield Fee.\n\n**Real-Time Events:** designed to enable Customers to analyze Azion's Product and Services' events via web interface, searching events in different Data Sources, with different time filters. AZION WILL USE ALL COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS TO RETAIN THE EVENTS FOR 3 DAYS AND MAKE THEM AVAILABLE TO OUR CUSTOMERS WITH A DELAY LOWER THAN 3 MINUTES. IN CASE OF PEAK ACCESS, ATTACKS OR EXTERNAL FACTORS, THE DELAY MAY BE SUPERIOR THAN THE FORESEEN. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Real-Time Events will be billed considering (a) Data Gathered; (b) Real-Time Events Queries, according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**Real-Time Metrics:** designed to enable Customers to monitor Azion's Product and Services key performance indicators via web interface or API.

O controle e o bloqueio de acesso podem ser realizados por endereço IP ou rede, geolocalização (país de acesso), HTTP Referer, Secure Token e Rate Limit. A Azion utiliza bases de dados de fornecedores externos para identificação de geolocalização baseada no endereço IP do Usuário, as quais podem ser imprecisas em algumas situações, cabendo ao Cliente a responsabilidade pelo uso dessa funcionalidade de restrição de acesso. O bloqueio por HTTP Referer se baseia em informações fornecidas pelo Browser ou aplicação que requisita o conteúdo, podendo ter sofrido manipulação maliciosa por parte do Usuário para obter acesso indevido, cabendo, portanto, ao Cliente a responsabilidade por esse tipo de controle de acesso. Rate Limit é calculado individualmente para cada Edge Server da Azion, não constituindo, portanto, um limite global de acesso ao conteúdo. Secure Token representa um mecanismo de validação de acesso baseado em Hash MD5, cabendo ao Cliente a segurança da Secret utilizada para geração do Hash. Salvo disposição em contrário no Contrato de Cliente ou quaisquer documentos anexos a ele, a cobrança do Edge Firewall se dará pelas Requests de acordo com os volumes consumidos. A AZION PROVÊ MECANISMOS DE CONTROLE DE ACESSO BASEADOS NO MELHOR ESFORÇO, MAS QUE NÃO CONSTITUEM RESTRIÇÕES INTRANSPONÍVEIS CONTRA ACESSOS NÃO AUTORIZADOS. O CLIENTE DEVE REALIZAR A RESTRIÇÃO DE ACESSO POR ENDEREÇO IP PARA OBTER O MELHOR NÍVEL DE CONTROLE E A AZION RECOMENDA A COMBINAÇÃO DE MÚLTIPLAS TÉCNICAS.\n\nWeb Application Firewall (WAF): projetado para proteger sites e aplicações web e inclui funcionalidades como: (1) controle para mitigar ameaças como SQL Injections, Cross-Site Scripting, RFI, entre outros; (2) criação de Rule Sets configuráveis para seleção dos mecanismos de proteção desejados e sensibilidade das regras; (3) criação de Whitelists customizadas de acordo com o comportamento da aplicação; (4) opção de Counting Mode para análise de ameaças sem o efetivo bloqueio das mesmas; (5) gráficos em tempo real contendo informações sobre ameaças detectadas e ataques bloqueados. Recomendamos habilitar a funcionalidade de Counting Mode assistido pelo Integration Services da Azion para etapa de aprendizado dos comportamentos da aplicação, para melhorar a eficiência do serviço e reduzir o risco de identificação de falsos positivos e bloqueio de requisições legítimas. Ainda assim, advertimos de que pode haver o bloqueio de requisições legítimas à aplicação, caso coincidam com alguma das regras de segurança do WAF. Salvo disposição em contrário no Contrato de Cliente ou quaisquer documentos anexos a ele, a cobrança do WAF se dará pelo (a) número de Requests; (b) número de WAF Rules e WAF Rule Sets, de acordo com os volumes consumidos. A AZION ESTÁ CONSTANTEMENTE BUSCANDO ATUALIZAÇÃO DE SEUS MECANISMOS DE SEGURANÇA PARA AUMENTAR A EFETIVIDADE DOS SISTEMAS DE PROTEÇÃO E REDUZIR O RISCO DE IMPACTO ÀS APLICAÇÕES DO CLIENTE, E UTILIZARÁ FERRAMENTAS DE TESTE DE SEGURANÇA (PENTEST) NA APLICAÇÃO DO CLIENTE, COM O INTUITO DE MELHORAR ESTES MECANISMOS DE SEGURANÇA. NO ENTANTO, NÃO HÁ UMA GARANTIA DE QUE O SERVIÇO WAF SERÁ CAPAZ DE PREVENIR TODAS AS POSSIBILIDADES DE ATAQUES OU AMEAÇAS. RECOMENDAMOS QUE OS CLIENTES MANTENHAM OS CONTROLES DE SEGURANÇA TAMBÉM EM SUAS ORIGENS. O CLIENTE ASSUME TODO O RISCO DE INDISPONIBILIDADE DE SERVIÇO DEVIDO A REGRAS MAL CONFIGURADAS NO SERVIÇO.\n\nImage Optimization: projetado para otimizar e manipular imagens dinamicamente, incluindo as seguintes funcionalidades: (1) otimização; (2) corte; (3) redimensionamento; (4) conversão de formato e (5) aplicações de filtros como blur, noise, marca d’água, dentre outros. Os formatos suportados são JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP e ICO. A manipulação das imagens é realizada através de parâmetros de Query String enviados na requisição. A otimização da imagem consiste no processo de reduzir o tamanho do arquivo de imagem, quando possível, buscando minimizar as perdas de qualidade perceptíveis da imagem, decorrentes do processo de otimização. A imagem poderá ser entregue em um formato de arquivo distinto do original, de acordo com o Browser de acesso do Usuário, buscando uma melhor otimização da entrega (ex: webp). Não há uma garantia de ganho no processo de otimização cabendo ao cliente monitorar o ganho médio decorrente do uso do serviço. Salvo disposição em contrário no Contrato de Cliente ou quaisquer documentos anexos a ele, a cobrança do Image Optimization se dará pelas Images Processed de acordo com os volumes consumidos. O CLIENTE DEVE ESTAR CIENTE DE QUE O PROCESSO DE OTIMIZAÇÃO DE IMAGENS ALTERA O CONTEÚDO ENTREGUE PARA O USUÁRIO FINAL, PODENDO RESULTAR EM DIFERENÇAS NA QUALIDADE VISUAL DA IMAGEM. A AZION PODERÁ, A QUALQUER MOMENTO E SEM AVISO PRÉVIO, ATUALIZAR OS ALGORITMOS DE OTIMIZAÇÃO, RESULTANDO EM DIFERENÇAS NO CONTEÚDO ENTREGUE E NA EFICIÊNCIA DA OTIMIZAÇÃO.\n\nCloud Storage: projetado para armazenar dados em nuvem com alta disponibilidade, replicação multi-datacenter, segurança e durabilidade.

    "body": "\n*Last updated: March 3, 2023.*\n\nThe following definitions related to Products and Services, billing methods, and other terms apply to the purchase and use of Azion Products and Services. We are constantly looking to improve our solutions. Consequently, this document may be updated and you should always look at its latest version.\n\nAll Azion products and services are offered as Edge Services and available through specific Internet communication protocols. Our servers are located at various points of presence (POPs) across the world. Azion Products and Services are orchestrated and configured via the Real-Time Manager interface or its APIs. Products and Services are billed according to their use, type of contract, and prices, as defined in the Customer Agreement.\n\n## 1\\. Products and Services\n\n**Application Acceleration:** an Edge Application module designed to accelerate web applications and APIs. It includes access to protocol optimization features, advanced caching rules (Advanced Cache Key) which allows granular caching with minimum TTL of 0 seconds, segmentation and caching policies based on criteria such as name/value of Cookies and Query Strings, in addition to features such as Rules Engine, Bypass Cache, KeepAlive, Forward Cookies, POST Cache, among others. HTTP GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE and OPTIONS methods available. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Application Acceleration will be billed considering the Data Transferred according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**Data Streaming:** designed to collect data from the Edge Applications or any other Azion's Products and Services. The Customer will choose which data to be collected and, by doing so, automatically declare to be authorized to collect all the selected data. AZION DOES NOT HOLD RESPONSIBILITY BY: (A) THE USAGE OF THE DATA BY THE CUSTOMER, (B) THE CUSTOMER RIGHTS TO COLLECT THEIR USER'S DATA. The collected data is sent to the customer's infrastructure using the protocol chosen in the Real-Time Manager interface or API by the Customer, formatted in NDJSON (Newline Delimited JSON) in a configurable template. The data is dispatched in blocks of 2 thousand requests separated by \\\\n (Newline), or 60 seconds, whichever happens first. Azion will use all commercially reasonable efforts to send all the data to the Customer's infrastructure, or its suppliers, in real time or with a delay lower than 3 minutes. However, in the case of access peaks, attacks or external causes, the delay can be greater. THE CUSTOMER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE AVAILABILITY OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO RECEIVE THE DATA AND, IN CASE OF UNAVAILABILITY, AZION CAN DISCARD THE DATA. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Data Streaming will be billed considering the (a) Data Streaming Requests and (b) Data Streamed, according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**DDoS Protection:** DDoS Protection will be provided exclusively under the terms available at https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/ddos-protection/ (“Guidelines”). By using Azion, Customer (i) authorizes Azion to impose the technical measures available on the Azion platform to control or mitigate DDoS attacks, even though such measures may result in performance degradation, and (ii) acknowledges that the Service Level Agreement (\"SLA\") does not apply while a DDoS attack is underway. The following Azion DDoS Protection service options are available: (i) DDoS Protection - 5 Gbps: includes the following features: (a) network flow analysis (layers 3 and 4); (b) detection of the most common DDoS attacks, network and transport layers, and (c) mitigation of the most common DDoS attacks, network and transport layers, up to the limit of 5 Gbps; (ii) DDoS Protection - 20 Gbps, includes all of the DDoS Protection - 5 Gbps features plus: (a) detection of more sophisticated DDoS attacks; (b) cost protection via service credits, when applicable; (c) mitigation of larger DDoS attacks up to 20 Gbps; (iii) DDoS Protection - 50 Gbps extends the protection against DDoS attacks up to 50 Gbps; and (iv) DDoS Protection - Unlimited, for unlimited protection against DDoS attacks, the mitigation may use the entire Azion network, in addition to 24x7 access to our Security Response Team (SRT) upon the purchase our Support Mission Critical service. Attacks exceeding the volumes purchased may be immediately blocked until the attack ends. To be eligible for a Service Credit (a) the DDoS attack must result in a bill that exceed the double of the average monthly consumption in the previous six (6) months, excluding the months in which a DDoS attack took place; (b) in the event of an impossibility to calculate the average monthly consumption in the previous six months, the average consumption volume in the available months will be used as basis; (c) Customer must notify the Azion Technical Support about an attack underway by registering a Support Ticket; (d) the Azion Technical Support must have determined the reported DDoS attack is a legitimate attack; and (e) credit applications must be sent by Customer within 30 days after the disputed service bill is closed. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Managed DDoS Protection will be billed at (a) a monthly set fee according to the protection limit purchased (Protection Fee) and, additionally, (b) a fee per total GB traffic (Total Data Transferred). By purchasing our Managed DDoS Protection service, the Customer will be required to pay for a minimum of twelve (12) months of the service. In the event Customer’s average bill exceeds the volume purchased, or in case more than two credits are applied for in a given calendar year, Azion will be entitled to require Customer to pay an additional DDoS Protection Fee for each attack suffered. Only a single credit may be applied each month, even when several attacks take place in the same month. Credits are to be issued as a credit note instead of a revised bill. AZION IS CONSTANTLY SEEKING TO UPGRADE OUR SECURITY MECHANISMS TO MAKE OUR PROTECTION SYSTEMS MORE EFFECTIVE AND REDUCE THE RISK OF IMPACTS TO CUSTOMER APPLICATIONS. HOWEVER, THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES THE DDOS SERVICE WILL BE ABLE TO PREVENT ALL POSSIBLE ATTACKS OR THREATS. CUSTOMERS SHOULD KEEP SECURITY CONTROLS AT THEIR ORIGINS AS WELL. CUSTOMERS ASSUME ALL RISKS OF SERVICE UNAVAILABILITY OWING TO RULES POORLY CONFIGURED IN THE SERVICE.\n\n**Digital Certificates:** this service brokers and obtains the issuance of shared SSL certificates of the Domain Validated (DV) type from a Certification Authority (CA) chosen by Azion, to be used solely for the Edge Application service. Customers must be able to prove their authority over the desired domains by following the technical procedures set by the CA. SSL certificates and private keys are shared among multiple Customers and will be held exclusively by Azion. Under no circumstances whatsoever will certificates and/or private keys be sent to the Customers. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Digital Certificates will be billed considering the number of Digital Certificates according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**Edge Application:** designed to enable Customers to build and run their own serverless applications at the Edge of the network, closer to users and devices. It is the ideal solution for applications that require low latency response time or real-time data processing. Each Edge Application can be assigned to multiple domains which can be accessed by users and devices. To guarantee the proper working of the service, Azion may enable, disable or modify services, POPs, IPs address, servers, any equipment or Customer content, without previous notice, always aiming the maintenance or performance improvement and availability. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Edge Application will be billed considering the number of (a) Domains, (b) Edge Applications, (c) Total Data Transferred, and (d) Requests, according to the volumes consumed, and the volume consumed by its modules.\n\n**Edge Caching:** an Edge Application's module designed to deliver web contents of all formats and types, including HTTP Live Streaming (HLS), via the HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1, and HTTP/2 protocols, along with support for the HTTP GET, HEAD and OPTIONS methods. Includes access to (1) the Azion network for content delivery; (2) content caching feature with minimum TTL of 60 seconds; (3) HTTP header manipulation; (4) creation of redirecting or content delivery rules; (5) the Real-Time Purge tool; (6) delivery of cached content while the origin is inaccessible; (7) delivery of HTTPS (TLS) with OCSP Stapling support; (8) digital certificate uploads and support for the TLS x509 SNI format, in case it is supported by the user’s browser, or use of the shared certificate in Azion’s domain; (9) integration with Azion Products and Services. To use this service, Customers need to store the original version of their Content in an origin web server with HTTP access. THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES THAT CONTENTS (OBJECTS) WILL BE AVAILABLE IN CACHE THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE TIME-TO-LIVE (TTL) CONFIGURED BY THE CUSTOMER. AZION MAKES THE NECESSARY INVESTMENTS TO KEEP DATA CACHED FOR THE CLOSEST TIME TO THAT CONFIGURED BY CUSTOMERS, HOWEVER, LEAST ACCESSED OBJECTS MAY BE AUTOMATICALLY DELETED FROM THE CACHE TO MAKE ROOM FOR MORE OFTEN ACCESSED OBJECTS VIA AN LRU (LEAST RECENTLY USED) ALGORITHM. MAXIMUM OBJECT SIZE IS 10GB. TO USE THE SERVICE WITH LARGER OBJECTS, CUSTOMERS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE A WRITTEN AUTHORIZATION FROM AZION. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Edge Caching will be billed according to the (a) Total Data Transferred; (b) Requests; and (c) Real-Time Purge Operations, according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**Edge Firewall:** designed for Customers to build and run their firewall rules at the Edge of the network, closest to users and devices. Each Edge Firewall can be linked to multiple domains, which in turn are accessible by users and devices. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Edge Firewall will be billed according to the volumes consumed in its modules.\n\n**Edge Functions:** designed to run the function's code on Azion's Edge, triggered by a request from the user or device, without the need of Customer provisioning or managing the underlying infrastructure. The function's code must receive 3 parameters: (a) the request's handler, (b) the reponse's handler, and (c) a JSON containing the variables parameterization. The function's code can be used to manipulate or transform the request or response. The created function must be associated to an Edge Application or Edge Firewall, where it can be parametrized by and argument formatted in JSON containing the function's variables. The trigger carrying the conditions to execute the function must be configured on the Edge Application or Edge Firewall associated to the function. Each request that comply with the configured runtime conditions is considered an Invocation which triggers the function's executions. AZION MAY CEASE, WITHOUT PREVIOUS NOTICE, THE FUNCTION'S EXECUTION: (A) CONSUMING MORE THAN THE MAXIMUM MEMORY DEFINED, (B) EXECUTING FOR LONGER THAN THE MAXIMUM DEFINED. AZION MAY REMOVE FUNCTIONS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN EXECUTED FOR MORE THAN THREE (3) MONTHS. CUSTOMER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN CONTENT, INCLUDING: (A) THE CODE'S PERFORMANCE, (B) THE LICENSE FOR USE OF A THIRD PARTY CODE OR THE RESPECT TO THE TERMS OF USE, AND (C) THE SECURITY OF THE SOURCE CODE USED.

Information such as response time when accessing users can be collected, in addition to information from the servers used to respond to the user's request. To activate it, you need to copy the Edge Pulse tag and insert it into the desired HTML pages. In doing so, the Customer declares himself authorized by its users to collect and process the information described above. The data collected may be used by Azion to improve performance and reliability in accessing Edge Applications. AZION IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR: (A) USE THAT WILL BE GIVEN BY THE CUSTOMER TO THE COLLECTED DATA; (B) THE RIGHT THAT THE CUSTOMER HAS TO COLLECT DATA FROM ITS USERS, BECAUSE BY INSERTING THE PULSE TAG IN ITS PAGES WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY AUTHORIZING AZION TO COLLECT THIS INFORMATION. (C) TAG REMOVAL FROM YOUR PAGES IN CASE OF PRODUCT WITHDRAWAL. Azion is committed to not collect any confidential or personal information from its users and also to the correct application of the information collected to constantly improve its delivery algorithms with the clear objective of guaranteeing the best possible experience for those who access our Edge Network. The usage of Edge Pulse must follow the guidelines provided in the product documentation. This way it will guarantee that its execution will be exclusively asynchronous, in other words, it will not impact the loading time and will not interfere in the internal structures of the page where it is inserted. Information related to user navigation will be made available to Customers through Real-Time Events and Data Streaming.\n\n**Image Processor:** an Edge Application module designed to optimize and dynamically manipulate images, and includes the following features: (1) optimization; (2) cutting; (3) resizing; (4) format conversion, and (5) applying filters such as blurring, noise, watermark, and others. The formats supported are JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP and ICO. Images are manipulated through Query String parameters sent in the request. Image optimization is the process of reducing the image file size, whenever possible, minimizing the quality losses noticeable in the image derived from the optimization process. Images may be delivered in a different file format other than the original, according to users’ access browser, in an effort to improve the delivery (ex: webp). There are no guarantee gains from the optimization process, and customers are tasked with monitoring the average gain from using the service. CUSTOMERS ARE HEREBY ADVISED THAT THE IMAGE OPTIMIZATION PROCESS ALTERS THE CONTENT DELIVERED TO END USERS AND MAY RESULT IN CHANGES TO THE VISUAL QUALITY OF THE IMAGE. AT ANY TIME AND WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE, AZION MAY UPDATE THE OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS AND SUCH CHANGES MAY ALTER THE CONTENTS DELIVERED AND THE OPTIMIZATION EFFICIENCY. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Image Processor will be billed considering the Images Processed according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**Intelligent DNS:** designed to provide an authoritative DNS service with support to standard QTYPES such as: A, AAAA, ANAME, CAA, CNAME, MX, NS, PTR, SRV and TXT.

Access control and blocking can be done by IP address or network (CIDR), geolocation (country of access) and ASN. Azion uses databases from external suppliers to identify geolocation and ASN based on the User's IP address, which may be inaccurate in some situations, with the Customer being responsible for the use of this access restriction functionality. AZION PROVIDES ACCESS CONTROL MECHANISMS BASED ON THE BEST EFFORT, BUT THAT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE UNTRANSPONIBLE RESTRICTIONS AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS. THE CUSTOMER MUST RESTRICT ACCESS BY IP ADDRESS TO OBTAIN THE BEST LEVEL OF CONTROL AND AZION RECOMMENDS THE COMBINATION OF MULTIPLE TECHNIQUES. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Network Layer Protection will be billed considering Requests according to the volumes consumed.\n\n**Origin Shield:** designed as an add-on to the Network Layer Protection module to assist in protecting the Customer's origin, Origin Shield has the following features: (a) access via Real-Time Manager and its API to the complete list of IP/CIDR addresses used by Azion's Products to communicate with the Customer's origins; (b) ensuring that new IP/CIDR addresses added to the Azion network will remain on hold for a period of 7 calendar days, from their inclusion in the Origin Shield listing until they start communicating with the Customer's origins; (c) email notification to the Customer's registered addresses, whenever there is a change in the IP/CIDR addresses used by the Azion network; and (d) discrimination in the History of the Real-Time Manager of the IP/CIDR addresses included and removed in each update of the listing. It is the Customer's responsibility to obtain the list of Origin Shield addresses through the Real-Time Manager or its API and to grant access at their origin, as well as to keep updated the list of email addresses that must receive notification from Azion. Azion will send notification emails, but has no way of guaranteeing that the message will reach the Customer's Mailbox and any error returns from the Customer's email system may result in the message being discarded. It is up to the Customer to keep their Firewall and access policies updated to allow the connection from Azion's servers. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Origin Shield will be billed considering a recurring Origin Shield Fee.\n\n**Real-Time Events:** designed to enable Customers to analyze Azion's Product and Services' events via web interface, searching events in different Data Sources, with different time filters.

The features provide easy access to your data, and using and combining the available features creates more personalized and specific queries to request the exact information you need.\n\nThe next sections will detail each available feature of GraphQL and how to use them.\n\n---\n\n## Datasets\n\nAzion **GraphQL API** uses defined datasets to indicate what requests you can run through queries and fetches data from **Real-Time Metrics** and **Real-Time Events**. They consist of organized tables informing your data.\n\nFind each available dataset and what they request next:\n\n| Dataset   | Description |\n|----------|-----------|\n| httpMetrics | Request events registered by [Edge Application](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/) and [Edge Firewall](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/).     |\n| l2CacheMetrics | Request events registered by [L2 Caching](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-caching#l2-caching).    |\n| edgeFunctionsMetrics | Events executed by [Edge Functions](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-functions/).     |\n| imagesProcessedMetrics |  Image processing events by [Image Processor](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/image-processor/).    |\n| idnsQueriesMetrics | Query events performed on [Intelligent DNS](/en/documentation/products/intelligent-dns/).     |\n| dataStreamedMetrics | Sent events of data by [Data Streaming](/en/documentation/products/data-streaming/) to the clients' endpoint.    |\n| httpEvents | Request events registered by [Edge Application](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/) and [Edge Firewall](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/).     |\n| l2CacheEvents | Request events registered by [L2 Caching](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-caching/#l2-caching).    |\n| edgeFunctionsEvents | Events executed by [Edge Functions](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-functions/).     |\n| imagesProcessedEvents |  Image processing events by [Image Processor](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/image-processor/).    |\n| idnsQueriesEvents | Query events performed on [Intelligent DNS](/en/documentation/products/intelligent-dns/).     |\n| dataStreamedEvents | Sent events of data by [Data Streaming](/en/documentation/products/data-streaming/) to the clients' endpoint.    |\n| cellsConsoleEvents |  Events logs from applications using [Edge Runtime](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-functions/runtime/overview/) returned by the Cells Console.  |\n\nTo see which fields are available for each Metrics dataset, read the [Fields Metrics GraphQL API](/en/documentation/products/graphql-api/features/metrics-fields/) documentation. You can also run an Introspection Query to consult metadata on the Metrics and Events datasets. Find out more on the [How to query metadata with GraphQL API](/en/documentation/products/guides/graphql-metadata/) guide.\n\n> Find out more on [How to select Top X queries with GraphQL API](/en/documentation/products/guides/graphql-top-x-query/).\n\nWhile using datasets, it's important to note you can request both *raw* and *aggregated* data models. By running a request for *raw* information, using the Events datasets, you receive as a response the *raw numbers* related to that specific dataset. By running a request for *aggregated* information, using the Metrics datasets, you receive your information in the form of *graphs* related to that specific dataset.\n\nTo specify you want to aggregate data with a time interval, you must add the *aggregate* operator in your query along with the `group_by` field. For example, the following query aggregates data:\n\n```graphql\nquery IdnsQuery {\n  idnsQueriesMetrics(\n    limit: 10\n    aggregate: {sum:requests}\n    groupBy: [ts]\n    filter: {\n      tsRange: {begin:\"2022-10-20T10:10:10\", end:\"2022-10-23T10:10:10\"}\n    }\n  ) \n  {\t\n    ts\n    sum\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> Find out more on how to aggregate data with the [How to query aggregated data with GraphQL API](/en/documentation/products/guides/graphql-aggregated-data/) guide.\n\nIt's important to note that with the *aggregated model* you'll receive data according to a time range defined through an *adaptive resolver*. Currently, there are three possible intervals to fetch your results: *minute*, *hour*, and *day*.\n\nEach query interval is used according to the following definitions:\n\n- **Minute**: used for queries in the interval of **up to 3 days**.\n- **Hour**: used for queries in the interval of **3 and 60 days**.\n- **Day**: used for queries in the interval of **over 60 days**.\n\nTo successfully receive data as a response, you must inform a time interval either through a `tsRange` or a `tsGt + tsLt` field in your queries with a valid date and time format. If you use `tsRange`, you'll receive data greater than or equal to or less than or equal to that specific interval, including the beginning and ending date you've informed.\n\nUse the following example as a basis to apply a `tsRange` in your request:\n\n```graphql\ntsRange: {begin:\"2022-06-23T09:10:10\", end:\"2022-06-23T16:10:10\"}\n```\n\nIf you use `tsGt + tsLt`, you'll receive data greater than or less than that specific interval, **not** including the beginning and ending date you've informed.\n\nUse the following example as a basis to apply a `tsGt + tsLt` in your request:\n\n```graphql\n{\n\n  \"tsGt\": \"2022-07-22T10:10:10\",\n\n  \"tsLt\": \"2022-09-19T10:10:10\"\n\n}\n```\n\nDefining and informing a time range interval in your queries is important to fetch data from the available datasets of the GraphQL API and continue running requests with the other available features.\n\n---\n\n## Filtering\n\nWith filtering parameters, responses returned by your queries can be more accurate to your set of data. You can use filtering with any available field in the dataset you're consulting.\n\nAs requesting complex or a large amount of data can cause responses to get noisy and complicate its use, filtering queries helps with getting exact and direct data from your requests. For example, if you're using the following query to request `httpMetrics`:\n\n```graphql\nquery HttpQuery {\n  httpMetrics(\n    limit: 10\n    filter: {\n      tsRange: {begin:\"2022-10-20T10:10:10\", end:\"2022-10-23T10:10:10\"}\n    }\n  ) \n  {\t\n    ts\n    sourceLocPop\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can filter the query by requesting data specific to the `sourceLocPop` field:\n\n```graphql\nquery HttpQuery {\n  httpMetrics(\n    limit: 10\n    filter: {\n      tsRange: {begin:\"2022-10-20T10:10:10\", end:\"2022-10-23T10:10:10\"}\n      sourceLocPop: \"lax-bso\"\n    }\n  ) \n  {\t\n    ts\n    sourceLocPop\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can feel free to update your request to use a field of your interest within the fields of the dataset you're consulting.\n\nYou can also filter using multiple `AND` and `OR` parameters. Make sure you define all the fields you're filtering for inside the parameter, like in the following example:\n\n```graphql\nquery totalImagesProcessedRequests {\n  imagesProcessedMetrics(\n    aggregate: {sum: requests}\n    limit: 100\n    filter: {\n      tsRange: {begin:\"2023-03-20T19:52:00\", end:\"2023-03-20T20:52:00\"}\n      or: {\n          status:304\n          statusRange: {begin: 200, end: 299}\n      }\n    }\n    groupBy:[ts]\n    orderBy:[ts_ASC]\n  )\n  {\n    ts\n    sum\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Sorting \n\nThe sorting feature lets you organize and sort the received data of a dataset according to the event's order. For example, if you're receiving the `host` field data as a response to your API request, you can sort the data to receive it in:\n\n- An *ascending order (ASC)*\n- A *descending order (DESC)*\n\nWhenever you use the `orderBy` property, you must add either the `ASC` or the `DESC` specification.\n\nFor example, to use the ascending order sorting feature, you need to add `orderBy` in your query and the field you want to sort + `ASC`:\n\n```graphql\n{\n    orderBy: [host_ASC]\n}\n```\n\nTo sort the data according to a *descending order (DESC)*, you need to add the field you want to sort + `DESC`:\n\n```graphql\n{\n    orderBy: [ts_DESC]\n}\n```\n\nSay you're using this query with `DESC`:\n\n```graphql\nquery SumBytesSentByHost {\n  httpMetrics(\n    limit: 1000\n    filter: {\n      tsRange: {begin:\"2023-01-01T17:03:00\", end:\"2023-06-01T18:05:00\"}\n    }\n    aggregate: {sum: bytesSent}\n    groupBy: [host]\n    orderBy: [sum_DESC]\n  ) \n  {        \n    host\n    sum\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou'll get a response similar to this:\n\n```graphql\n{\n    \"data\": {\n        \"httpMetrics\": [\n            {\n                \"host\": \"g1sdetynmxe0ao.map.azionedge.net\",\n                \"sum\": 606226\n            },\n            {\n                \"host\": \"uaykhefjdk9or.map.azionedge.net\",\n                \"sum\": 583059\n            },\n            {\n                \"host\": \"wz0ywpod397zk.map.azionedge.net\",\n                \"sum\": 567633\n            },\n            {\n                \"host\": \"zi1435nbhec7.map.azionedge.net\",\n                \"sum\": 96002\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAnd if you're using this query with `ASC`:\n\n```graphql\nquery AvgRequesTimeByHost {\n  httpMetrics(\n    limit: 1000\n    filter: {\n      tsRange: {begin:\"2023-01-01T17:03:00\", end:\"2023-06-01T18:05:00\"}\n    }\n    aggregate: {avg:requestTime}\n    groupBy: [ts, host]\n    orderBy: [avg_ASC]\n  ) \n  {        \n    ts\n    host\n    avg\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou'll get a response similar to this:\n\n```graphql\n{\n    \"data\": {\n        \"httpMetrics\": [\n            {\n                \"ts\": \"2023-04-21T00:00:00Z\",\n                \"host\": \"zipo145nbhc7.map.azionedge.net\",\n                \"avg\": 0.04871428571428572\n            },\n            {\n                \"ts\": \"2023-04-13T00:00:00Z\",\n                \"host\": \"g1snmxepa0ao.map.azionedge.net\",\n                \"avg\": 0.561\n            },\n            {\n                \"ts\": \"2023-04-11T00:00:00Z\",\n                \"host\": \"g1syinmxe2ao.map.azionedge.net\",\n                \"avg\": 4.101833333333333\n            },\n            {\n                \"ts\": \"2023-04-11T00:00:00Z\",\n                \"host\": \"wz1yd307zk.map.azionedge.net\",\n                \"avg\": 8.705666666666668\n            },\n            {\n                \"ts\": \"2023-05-22T00:00:00Z\",\n                \"host\": \"uaifjdk6or.map.azionedge.net\",\n                \"avg\": 31.493818181818185\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Pagination\n\n**Pagination** is a feature designed to help you decide where you want your results to begin from and how many results you want to see. Currently, Azion **GraphQL API** uses *offset and limit pagination* to provide the feature.\n\nUsing pagination can be useful when you get a large number of data in response to your API request. You can use the feature by setting **offsets** and **limits**. This way, the API knows it needs to return data within the specific range you've set.\n\nThe **offsets** parameter sets the number of records you want to skip in your data response, and the **limits** parameter sets the number of results you want to receive.\n\n> Setting offset and limit parameters isn't mandatory. In case you don't set the parameters, GraphQL API automatically sets the **offset** for **0** and the **limit** for **10**.\n\nSee the following example on how to set offset and limit parameters:\n\n```graphql\nquery HttpQuery {\n  httpMetrics(\n    offset: 15\n    limit: 30\n    filter: {\n      tsRange: {begin:\"2022-10-20T10:10:10\", end:\"2022-10-23T10:10:10\"}\n    }\n  ) \n  {\t\n    ts\n    sourceLocPop\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe offset is set for 15, meaning your response will start with the 16th result, and the limit is set for 30, meaning your response will give you a total of 30 results. In this case, you'll receive a response from the 16th result until the 45th result.\n\n> If your data is constantly updated, using pagination may cause missing or duplicate data when you run more than one request using the feature.\n",

    "body": "\nLearn how to access Azion **GraphQL API** and the **GraphQL** playground.\n\n---\n\n## Accessing GraphQL API\n\nTo use **GraphQL API** with API platforms such as Postman and Insomnia, you first need authentication to ensure requests access data securely. This authentication occurs through **Tokens**.\n\nTo create a Token, you can follow two different paths:\n\n- Use Azion **API platform**.\n- Use **Real-Time Manager (RTM)**.\n\nThe first option is to create a **Token** through the Azion [API platform](https://api.azion.com/). You can go to [Token](https://api.azion.com/#1b90377d-6f99-4f09-bf4a-9ed630a75afd) and run your request.\n\nThe second option is to create a **Personal Token** through the Azion configuration interface, [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/). This option is more suitable for use with APIs due to the possibility of creating a long-lived token. See the [Personal Tokens](/en/documentation/products/accounts/personal-tokens/) documentation page to create one.\n\n> When creating a Personal Token, you'll have to set an *expiration date*. For use with APIs, it's recommended to set a longer expiration date, such as *90 days* or *1 year*. In that case, make sure you take the necessary precautions to ensure your project's security.\n\nAfter creating your Personal Token, head to the API platform you'll be using and include the Azion GraphQL API endpoint in your request:\n\n- To use the Metrics API for aggregated data, include: `https://api.azionapi.net/metrics/graphql`\n- To use the Events API for raw data, include: `https://api.azionapi.net/events/graphql`\n\n---\n\n## Accessing GraphQL playground\n\nYou can use Azion **GraphQL** built-in playground to write, validate, and test GraphQL queries. Using the playground can help you become more familiar with the API and the use of queries in a visual and quick manner.\n\nTo interact with the GraphQL playground, you first need to log in to [RTM](https://manager.azion.com/). If you haven't created an account, see the [Creating an account on Azion](/en/documentation/products/accounts/creating-account/) documentation page.\n\nAfter successfully logging in to **RTM**, go to `https://manager.azion.com/metrics/graphql` or `https://manager.azion.com/events/graphql` and interact with the GraphQL playground.\n\nWatch a video tutorial on GraphQL’s first steps on Azion’s YouTube channel:\n\n<iframe\n   src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tVyRGO-n_rI\"\n   loading=\"lazy\"\n   width=\"600\"\n   height=\"400\"\n   title=\"First Steps with GraphQL\"\n   frameborder=\"0\"\n   allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\n   allowfullscreen></iframe>\n",

    "body": "\n**Graphic Query Language (GraphQL)** is a language created for use with APIs. It works as an alternative to REST APIs, allowing you to get data according to your needs. GraphQL gives you autonomy to request the data you want and receive exactly what you asked for through a JSON result.\n\nAs GraphQL fetches information differently from traditional APIs, it assists you in filtering data without overfetching. The precise response it provides also gives a better performance to those using GraphQL and makes it easier to use. Another difference from other APIs is that it has a single endpoint.\n\nHaving in mind clients who want to request and visualize their data with easy and improved performance, Azion now provides support for GraphQL. You can use the API to maximize the use of your data accessed through [Real-Time Metrics](/en/documentation/products/real-time-metrics/), which provides you with real-time access to metrics so you can optimize all of your potential, and [Real-Time Events](/en/documentation/products/real-time-events/), which provides data in real time so you can perform complex searches to explore your information.\n\nYou can also check all Azion **Observe** products: [Data Streaming](/en/documentation/products/data-streaming/) and [Edge Pulse](/en/documentation/products/edge-pulse/).\n\nYou don't need a specific database, framework, or programming language to use GraphQL. You can use it with the code and data you're already used to. The API relies on queries to access your data and information and filter what you need. Even if you've already made a request, you can change, delete, or add more information with a simple modification in your query.\n\nHere's an example of what a query looks like:\n\n```graphql\nquery HttpQuery {\n  httpMetrics(\n    filter: {\n      tsRange: {begin: \"2022-03-21T10:10:10\", end: \"2022-09-23T10:10:10\"}\n    }\n  ) \n  {\t\n    ts\n    geolocCountryName\n    geolocRegionName\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd here's an example of what the JSON response will look like:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"data\": {\n        \"httpMetrics\": [\n            {\n                \"ts\": \"2022-10-21T15:00:00Z\",\n                \"geolocCountryName\": \"Canada\",\n                \"geolocRegionName\": \"Quebec\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"ts\": \"2022-10-21T14:00:00Z\",\n                \"geolocCountryName\": \"Brazil\",\n                \"geolocRegionName\": \"Parana\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBy using queries in Azion GraphQL API, you can request both *raw* and *aggregated* data. If you request the *aggregated* data model, the API will fetch your data according to a predefined interval of *minutes*, *hours*, or *days*.\n",

    "body": "\nQueries are the starting point to begin consulting information as you use a query to request information from a database. The **GraphQL API** relies on queries to fetch values and send the requested data as a response with a similar format in a JSON file.\n\nThe use of queries enables requesting and fetching specific data. This means you can get a response to your request even with a small query if you don't want to see data that isn't essential at that moment. Using queries also means you get faster responses, as the GraphQL API doesn't need to fetch unnecessary amount of data.\n\nQueries also make it easier for you to add or delete information from your request. For example, if you request data for `httpMetrics`:\n\n```graphql\nquery HttpQuery {\n  httpMetrics(\n    limit: 2\n    filter: {\n      tsRange: {begin:\"2022-10-20T10:10:10\", end:\"2022-10-23T10:10:10\"}\n    }\n  ) \n  {\t\n    ts\n    sourceLocPop\n    requests\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd decide you want to add `idnsQueriesMetrics` to your request, you can add a similar query, only changing the dataset you want to fetch, and run another request:\n\n```graphql\nquery IdnsQuery {\n  idnsQueriesMetrics(\n    limit: 2\n    filter: {\n      tsRange: {begin:\"2022-10-20T10:10:10\", end:\"2022-10-23T10:10:10\"}\n    }\n  ) \n  {\t\n    ts\n    sourceLocPop\n    requests\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBy using queries, your requests and responses also become more organized. Due to GraphQL's ability to adapt, you can make several calls to the API and still receive only the data you requested in an organized JSON result.\n\nUsing the GraphQL API and its features also improve your performance.\n\n---\n\n## Operators\n\nOperators are special keys that allow you to customize your query to perform from basic to more complex logical comparisons. You can use them for both the Metrics GraphQL and the Events GraphQL.\n\nDepending on the operator you use, you'll change the condition you're querying for and receive different results. The following operators can be used with GraphQL:\n\n| Key | Description | GraphQL Operator |\n| --- | ----------- | --------------- |\n| eq | Consults data that are an exact match, *equal*, to the specified value. | `Eq` |\n| ne | Consults data that are different, *not equal*, from the specified value. | `Ne` |\n| like | Consults data that are *like* the specified value, with case-sensitive values. | `Like` |\n| ilike | Consults data that are *insensitive like* the specified value, with case-insensitive values. | `Ilike` |\n| is_null | Consults data that *are null* or *aren't null* compared to the specified value, using `true` or `false`. | `IsNull` |\n| in | Consults data contained in a given list, *in*, the specified value. | `In` |\n| not_in | Consults data that aren't in a given list, *not in*, the specified value. | `NotIn` |\n| lt | Consults data with values smaller than, *less than*, the specified value. | `Lt` |\n| lte | Consults data with values smaller or equal, *less than or equal*, to the specified value. | `Lte` |\n| gt | Consults data with values larger, *greater than*, the specified value. | `Gt` |\n| gte | Consults data with values larger or equal, *greater than or equal*, to the specified value. | `Gte` |\n| range | Consults data that are part of the *range* of the specified values. | `Range` |\n\nIf you're using the `Like` and `Ilike` operators, you must also pass the identifier `%` inside the field in the position you want to use:\n\n| Identifier position | Description | Example |\n| ------------------ | ----------- | -------- |\n| End | Any string that starts with the characters. | \"Braz%\" |\n| Beginning | Any string that ends with the characters. | \"%ao Paulo\" |\n| End and beginning | Any string that contains the characters. | \"%ttp%\" |\n\nHere are a few examples of fields with an operator:\n\n| Operator | Example | Description |\n| -------- | ------- | ----------- |\n| Eq | upstreamCacheStatusEq: \"HIT\" | Searches everything that matches exactly the `HIT` value in the upstreamCacheStatus field. |\n| Ne | geolocCountryNameNe: \"Brazil\" | Searches everything that isn't `Brazil` in the geolocCountryName field. |\n| Like | hostLike: \"%mysite.com%\" | Searches everything for hosts with the particular `mysite.com` pattern and is *case-sensitive.* |\n| Ilike | hostIlike: \"%mysite.com%\" | Searches everything for hosts with the particular `mysite.com` pattern and is *case-insensitive*. |\n\nDepending on the [type of field of a dataset](/en/documentation/products/graphql-api-features/#queries-datasets) you're querying for, you'll get to use different operators:\n\n| Field type | Possible operators |\n| --- | ----------- |\n| String | `Eq`, `Ne`, `Like`, `Ilike`, `In`, `NotIn`, `IsNull`  |\n| Integer, Float, DateTime | `Eq`, `Lt`, `Lte`, `Gt`, `Gte`, `Ne`, `In`, `NotIn`, `IsNull`, `Range` |\n",

    "body": "\n[ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) can be used in almost all tasks that involve understanding or generating natural language or code. In the development environment, it's a tool used for boosting developers' productivity, helping them to:\n\n- Explain the code being implemented.\n- Generate new code.\n- Refactor preexisting code.\n\n---\n\n## How does the Edge Functions ChatGPT integration work?\n\n**Edge Functions Code Editor** is integrated into the ChatGPT APIs, so you can use a set of features inside the editor, without opening another tab. The features go from refactoring the code to generating new code based on the prompt input.\n\nFirst, you need to configure your credentials registered on the OpenAI platform and generate an API key and org:\n\n- [Generate ChatGPT API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)\n- [Generate ChatGPT Organization ID](https://platform.openai.com/account/org-settings)\n\nWith your credentials in hand, paste them into your source code as a comment, as exemplified below:\n\n```js\n    /*\n    ChatGPTKey=key // Your ChatGPT key\n    ChatGPTOrg=org // The org\n    */\n```\n\nNow, with your credentials set, you're able to use the integration to develop faster and have your code reviewed whenever you like.\n\n---\n\n## Features\n\n### Code Explanation\n\nOne feature available on this integration is **Code Explanation**. It comes in handy when you have to debug a function, or simply review it. It's also useful when you're working on legacy code.\n\n### Code Generation\n\n**Code Generation** works based on the prompt informed. For example, let's say you want to return an `HTML` page, with a table containing the name, phone number, and address.\n\n**Prompt**:\n```js\n    // generate an html table with name, phone number and address\n```\n\nAfter writing the prompt inside the code editor, right-click it and select `ChatGPT: Generate`.\n\n**Output**:\n```js\n    <body>\n     <table>\n       <thead>\n         <tr>\n           <th>Name</th>\n           <th>Phone Number</th>\n           <th>Address</th>\n         </tr>\n       </thead>\n       <tbody>\n         <tr>\n           <td>John Smith</td>\n           <td>(123) 456-7890</td>\n           <td>123 Main St, Anytown, USA</td>\n         </tr>\n         <tr>\n           <td>Jane Doe</td>\n           <td>(987) 654-3210</td>\n           <td>456 Oak St, Anytown, USA</td>\n         </tr>\n         <tr>\n           <td>Bob Johnson</td>\n           <td>(555) 555-1212</td>\n           <td>789 Maple St, Anytown, USA</td>\n         </tr>\n       </tbody>\n     </table>\n    </body>\n```\n\n### Code Refactor\n\nAnother option is to ask ChatGPT to refactor the code. To do so, select the piece of code you want to refactor, then right-click on it and select `ChatGPT: Refactor`. After that, your code will be refactored automatically. \n\n**Tip**: it's always a good idea to test and ensure the refactored code is working as expected, avoiding unexpected issues in the future.\n\n---\n\n## Implementation\n\nHere's a real-life implementation of the Edge Functions ChatGPT integration:\n\n| Implementation | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| [How to build an API with Edge Functions and ChatGPT](/en/documentation/products/guides/edge-functions/api-builder/) | See how to build an API and have its responses returned in JSON, with the help of ChatGPT |\n",

They are used to store sensitive information or configuration settings that shouldn't be hardcoded into the codebase.\n\n## Security\n\nOne of the primary reasons to use environment variables is to enhance the security of your project. Sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, or access tokens can be easily compromised if they are hardcoded in your codebase.\n\nBy using environment variables, you can keep this sensitive information separate from the code and limit access to authorized individuals or systems. This reduces the risk of accidental exposure or unauthorized access to critical data.\n\n## Configuration flexibility\n\nEnvironment variables enable greater flexibility in configuring your application. Instead of modifying code or recompiling your application to update settings, you can simply change the values of the environment variables.\n\nThis makes it easier to deploy your application across different environments (development, staging, production) or when using different providers (such as cloud platforms), as each environment can have its own set of variables.\n\n## Portability\n\nEnvironment variables contribute to the portability of your application. By abstracting configuration details away from the code, you can easily move your application between different environments or platforms without modifying the codebase. This is particularly useful when scaling your application or deploying it in different hosting environments.\n\n## Collaboration\n\nEnvironment variables promote collaboration among team members. Since sensitive information isn't exposed directly in the codebase, it's safer to have more than one developer working on the same project.\n\n## Version control\n\nBy excluding sensitive information from the codebase, you can avoid committing secrets to version control systems. This prevents secrets from being inadvertently leaked when sharing code repositories or during code reviews. Instead, only the configuration templates or placeholders for environment variables are committed, ensuring the security of sensitive information.\n\n## Compliance\n\nIn many cases, organizations need to adhere to compliance standards that regulate the handling of sensitive data. By using environment variables, you can meet these compliance requirements by ensuring sensitive information is properly protected, controlled, and auditable.\n\n---\n\n## Environment variables on the Azion platform\n\n### Azion API\n\nYou can manage your environment variables trough the [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/)\n\n### Azion CLI\n\nThe command `variables` is available and can be used to manage your environment variables using [Azion CLI](/en/documentation/products/cli/variables/).\n\nLearn more about the command on [Variables command and its subcommands](/en/documentation/products/cli/variables/)\n\n---\n\n## Environment Variables and Edge Functions\n\nYou can retrieve the value of your configured environment variable inside an edge function by making use of the `Azion.env.get()` interface, passing its key. Example:\n\n```javascript\n  const apiToken = Azion.env.get('API_SERVICE_TOKEN');\n```\n\nLearn more about the [Environment Variables interface](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-functions/runtime/api-reference/environment-variables/).\n\n---\n\n## Limits\n\n| Scope | Limitation | Description |\n| - | - | - |\n| Keys | 100 per client | Each account can have a maximum of 100 defined variables. |  \n| Value | 32 kB | The maximum size of a value is 32 kB. |",

The Azion core team strongly advocates for strict mode as the sensible default choice. This mode empowers developers with essential JavaScript features that ideally should have been available from the beginning. However, as JavaScript evolved over time, incorporating these features would have introduced breaking changes to existing codebases.\n\nStrict mode makes several changes to normal JavaScript semantics:\n- Eliminates some JavaScript silent errors by changing them to throw errors.\n- Fixes mistakes that make it difficult for JavaScript engines to perform optimizations: strict mode code can sometimes be made to run faster than identical code that's not strict mode.\n- Prohibits some syntax likely to be defined in future versions of ECMAScript.\n\nLearn more about [Strict mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode)\n",

New possibilities are unlocked when using the Preview, such as:\n\n- Test different flows based on the http method provided.\n- See the outcome of an HTML page.\n- Return data in JSON.\n\n---\n\n## How does Azion Preview Deployment work?\n\nAzion Preview Deployment depends on an auxiliary function inside your source code. This function is called `PreviewProvider`, and it's responsible for debugging and simulating a request, returning the outcome to be rendered. The `PreviewProvider` function is represented as:\n\n```js\n    function PreviewProvider<PreviewProvider>(args) {\n        var request = new Request(\"https://azion.com/example\", {\n            method: \"GET\",\n            headers: {\n                \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n                \"Authorization\": \"Bearer my-token\"\n            },\n            redirect: \"follow\",\n        });\n        return handleRequest(request);\n    }\n```\n\n>**Note**: without the `PreviewProvider` function, it isn't possible to visualize the preview.\n\nNow, with your simulated request running, you're able to set different behaviors to your function, based on all properties available inside the request variable, such as:\n\n```js\n    async function handleRequest(request){\n        switch (request.Method){\n            case 'GET':\n             return new Response(html,{\n                headers:{\n                    \"content-type\":\"text/html:charset=UTF-8\",\n                }\n             })\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nIn this code snippet, it's defined that if a `GET` request is called, it returns the `HTML` var, containing the html to be output, and set its content type as required to perform this action.\n\n### API Builder\n\nIt's also possible to build APIs and have the outcome based on the request method. For example:\n\n- You can have an object in `JSON` as the response, if the request is a `POST`, by altering the `content-type` header and returning the object using the `JSON.stringify()` function.\n\n- In case the request is a `GET`, and you wish to return an HTML page, the `content-type` should be set as `text/html:charset=UTF-8`. The response is going to be presented already rendered on the preview.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\n    async function handleRequest(request){\n        switch (request.Method){\n            case 'POST':\n             return new Response(objectList,{\n                headers:{\n                    \"content-type\":\"application/json\",\n                }\n             })\n            case 'GET':\n             return new Response(html,{\n                headers:{\n                    \"content-type\":\"text/html:charset=UTF-8\",\n                }\n            })\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nThe output is shown right next to the code editor. It's possible to open it on a different tab as well, clicking on the **open** button.\n\n---\n\n## Preview Provider and ChatGPT\n\nThe ChatGPT integration helps you to boost your productivity and, alongside the Preview Deployment, enables more analytical implementations, making it possible to test and see new ideas on the fly.

You can review the documentation directly on the MDN website [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WebAssembly).\n\n## WebAssembly – Static methods\n\n### WebAssembly.compile()\n\nThe WebAssembly.compile() function compiles WebAssembly binary code into a `WebAssembly.Module` object. This function is useful if it's necessary to compile a module before it can be instantiated (otherwise, the `WebAssembly.instantiate()` function should be used).\n\n**Syntax**\n\n`WebAssembly.compile(bufferSource)`\n\n**Parameters**\n\n`bufferSource`\n\nA typed array or ArrayBuffer containing the binary code of the .wasm module you want to compile.\n\n**Example**\n\n```\nfetch('http://url/simple.wasm').then(response =>\n  response.arrayBuffer()\n).then(bytes =>\n  WebAssembly.compile(bytes)\n).then(mod =>\n  //your code here\n);\n```\n\n### WebAssembly.compileStreaming()\n\nThe `WebAssembly.compileStreaming()` function compiles a `WebAssembly.Module` from a streamed underlying source. This function can be necessary to compile a module before it can be instantiated (otherwise, the `WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming()` function should be used).\n\n**Syntax**\n\n`WebAssembly.compileStreaming (source)`\n\n**Parameters**\n\n`source`\n\nA Response object, representing the underlying source of a `.wasm module` you want to stream and compile.\n\n**Example**\n\n```js\n  var importObject = { imports: { imported_func: arg => console.log(arg) } };\n\n  WebAssembly.compileStreaming(fetch('http://url/simple.wasm'))\n  .then(module => WebAssembly.instantiate(module, importObject))\n  .then(instance => instance.exports.exported_func());\n```\n\n### WebAssembly.instantiate()\n\nThe `WebAssembly.instantiate()` function allows you to compile and instantiate WebAssembly code. This function has two overloads:\n\n- The primary overload takes the WebAssembly binary code, in the form of a typed array or ArrayBuffer, and performs both compilation and instantiation in one step;\n- The secondary overload takes an already-compiled WebAssembly.Module and returns a Promise that resolves to an Instance of that Module.\n\n**Syntax** (primary overload)\n\n`WebAssembly.instantiate(bufferSource, importObject);`\n\n**Parameters**\n\n`bufferSource`\n\nA typed array or `ArrayBuffer` containing the binary code of the .wasm module you want to compile.\n\n`importObject` (optional)\n\nAn object containing the values to be imported into the newly-created Instance, such as functions or WebAssembly.Memory objects. There must be one matching property for each declared import of the compiled module or else a WebAssembly.LinkError is thrown.\n\n**Example**\n\n```js\nvar importObject = {\n  imports: {\n    imported_func: function(arg) {\n      console.log(arg);\n    }\n  }\n};\n\nfetch('http://url/simple.wasm').then(response =>\n  response.arrayBuffer()\n).then(bytes =>\n  WebAssembly.instantiate(bytes, importObject)\n).then(result =>\n  result.instance.exports.exported_func()\n);\n```\n\n**Syntax** (secondary overload)\n\n`WebAssembly.instantiate(module, importObject);`\n\n**Parameters**\n\n`module`\n\nThe WebAssembly.Module object to be instantiated.\n\n`importObject` (optional)\n\nAn object containing the values to be imported into the newly-created Instance, such as functions or WebAssembly.Memory objects. There must be one matching property for each declared import of module or else a `WebAssembly.LinkError` is thrown.\n\n**Example**\n\n```\nWebAssembly.compileStreaming(fetch('http://url/simple.wasm'))\n.then(module => WebAssembly.instantiate(module))\n.then(instance => instance.exports.exported_func());\n```\n\n### WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming()\n\nThe `WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming()` function compiles and instantiates a WebAssembly module directly from a streamed underlying source.

The data types of each of the payload elements must match the corresponding data type specified in the Tag.\n\nThe constructor may also take an options object. The options.traceStack property can be set true (by default it is false) to indicate that WebAssembly code that throws the exception may populate the exception's stack property with a stack track.\n\n**Syntax**\n\n```js\nnew Exception(tag, payload, options)\n```\n\n**Parameters**\n\n`tag`\n\nAn WebAssembly.Tag defining the data types expected for each of the values in the payload.\n\n`payload`\n\nAn array of one or more data fields comprising the payload of the exception. The elements must match the data types of the corresponding elements in the tag. If the number of data fields in the payload and their types don't match, a TypeError exception is thrown.\n\n`options` (optional)\n\nAn object with the following optional fields:\n\n`traceStack` (optional)\n\ntrue if the Exception may have a stack trace attached to its stack property, otherwise false. This is false by default (if options or options.traceStack are not provided).\n\n**Exceptions**\n\n`TypeError`\n\nThe payload and tag sequences do not have the same number of elements and/or the elements are not of matching types.\n\n**Example**\n\n```js\n  // Create tag and use it to create an exception\n  const tag = new WebAssembly.Tag({ parameters: [\"i32\", \"f32\"] });\n  const exception = new WebAssembly.Exception(tag, [42, 42.3]);\n```\n\nFor more information on [WebAssembly](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/JavaScript_interface) visit MDN Web Docs.\n",

However, other objects such as XMLHttpRequest, AudioNode, and AudioContext can also be event targets.\n\nIn addition to implementing the EventTarget interface, many event targets like elements, documents, and windows also allow setting [event handlers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/Event_handlers) through \"onevent\" properties and attributes.\n\n## Constructor\n\n[EventTarget()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/EventTarget)\nCreates a new EventTarget object instance.\n\n## Instance methods\n\n[EventTarget.addEventListener()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener)\nRegisters an event handler of a specific event type on the EventTarget.\n\n[EventTarget.removeEventListener()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/removeEventListener)\nRemoves an event listener from the EventTarget.\n\n[EventTarget.dispatchEvent()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/dispatchEvent)\nDispatches an event to this EventTarget.\n\nFor more information on [EventTarget](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget) visit MDN Web Docs.\n",

A `forEach()` call is used to write each chunk of the string to the stream. Finally, `write()` and `close()` return promises that are processed to deal with success or failure of chunks and streams.\n\n```js\n const list = document.querySelector('ul');\n\n function sendMessage(message, writableStream) {\n   // defaultWriter is of type WritableStreamDefaultWriter\n   const defaultWriter = writableStream.getWriter();\n   const encoder = new TextEncoder();\n   const encoded = encoder.encode(message, { stream: true });\n   encoded.forEach((chunk) => {\n     defaultWriter.ready\n       .then(() => defaultWriter.write(chunk))\n       .then(() => {\n         console.log(\"Chunk written to sink.\");\n       })\n       .catch((err) => {\n         console.log(\"Chunk error:\", err);\n       });\n   });\n   // Call ready again to ensure that all chunks are written\n   //   before closing the writer.\n   defaultWriter.ready\n     .then(() => {\n       defaultWriter.close();\n     })\n     .then(() => {\n       console.log(\"All chunks written\");\n     })\n     .catch((err) => {\n       console.log(\"Stream error:\", err);\n     });\n }\n\n const decoder = new TextDecoder(\"utf-8\");\n const queuingStrategy = new CountQueuingStrategy({ highWaterMark: 1 });\n let result = \"\";\n const writableStream = new WritableStream({\n   // Implement the sink\n   write(chunk) {\n     return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n       const buffer = new ArrayBuffer(1);\n       const view = new Uint8Array(buffer);\n       view[0] = chunk;\n       const decoded = decoder.decode(view, { stream: true });\n       const listItem = document.createElement('li');\n       listItem.textContent = `Chunk decoded: ${decoded}`;\n       list.appendChild(listItem);\n       result += decoded;\n       resolve();\n     });\n   },\n   close() {\n     const listItem = document.createElement('li');\n     listItem.textContent = `[MESSAGE RECEIVED] ${result}`;\n     list.appendChild(listItem);\n   },\n   abort(err) {\n     console.log(\"Sink error:\", err);\n   }\n }, queuingStrategy);\n\n sendMessage(\"Hello, world.\", writableStream);\n```\n\n---\n\nFor more information on [WritableStreamDefaultWriter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WritableStreamDefaultWriter) visit MDN Web Docs.\n",

    "body": "\nSee the command and subcommands that enable the creation and management of your edge applications on the Azion Platform using the Azion **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**.\n\n---\n\n## Initializing\n\nThe initialization process creates the necessary environment for building your edge application. To do this, you must first:\n\n- Choose one of the available types in the CLI:\n  - Next.js\n  - Static\n  - CDN\n- Initialize a **JavaScript** project with **Node.js** runtime environment.\n\n### Usage\n\n```bash\n    azioncli edge_applications init\n```\n\n### Flags\n\n#### Name\n\nThe `--name` option can be specified, but it isn't mandatory. If it isn't informed, the name of your project will be the same one that is in your `package.json` file.\n\n#### Type\n\nThe `--type` option can be specified, but it isn't mandatory. If it isn't informed, the type of your project will be autodetected.\n\nThe CLI currently provides three templates and the type `cdn` for building edge applications that follow `--type`:\n\n- Static\n\n```bash\n    azioncli edge_applications init --name <\"application_name\"> --type static\n```\n\n- Next.js\n\n```bash\n    azioncli edge_applications init --name <\"application_name\"> --type nextjs\n```\n\n- CDN\n\n```bash\n    azioncli edge_applications init --name <\"application_name\"> --type cdn\n```\n\n> **Note**: if there's no `package.json` configuration file in your edge application directory, the CLI will return the following error message:\n\n```bash\n    Error: Failed to find package.json in current directory. Verify if you are currently in your project's directory\n```\n\nIn that case, create a `package.json` configuration file for your project in the same directory as your edge application. Then rerun the command in order to initialize the application.\n\n> **Tip**: the best solution for creating a `package.json` file is to start a Node.js project in your edge application directory. To do so, use the command below from the Node.js runtime environment:\n>\n> `npm init -y`\n\nCommand response in terminal:\n\n```bash\n    Wrote to /Users/<user_name>/web-app-proj/package.json:\n\n    {\n    \"name\": \"web-app-proj\",\n    \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n    \"description\": \"\",\n    \"main\": \"index.js\",\n    \"scripts\": {\n        \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\"\n    },\n    \"keywords\": [],\n    \"author\": \"\",\n    \"license\": \"ISC\"\n    }\n```\n\n#### No\n\nThe `--no` option forces a `no` response to all user inputs.\n\n#### Yes\n\nThe `--yes` option forces a 'yes' response to all user inputs.\n\n---\n\n## Building\n\nThe second step in creating an edge application is to build it based on the attributes provided in the `init` command. The command used to build the application is the `build` command.\n\n### Usage\n\n```bash\n    azioncli edge_applications build\n```\n\n### Flags\n\n#### Help\n\nThe only flag available for the `build` command is `--help`, which displays a brief help screen.\n\n**Note**: a requirement for using the `build` command is the presence of the [webPack](https://webpack.js.org/) framework installed on your computer.\n\n---\n\n## Publishing\n\nThe final step in creating an edge application is publishing it on the Azion platform. The `publish` command performs this task automatically.\n\n### Usage\n\n```bash\n    azioncli edge_applications publish\n```\n\n### Flags\n\n#### Help\n\nThe only flag available for the `publish` command is `--help`, which displays a brief help screen.\n\n**Note**: publishing an edge application via **RTM** or CLI isn't an instantaneous process. There's a time to propagate and configure the application in Azion's edge locations. It may be necessary to wait a few minutes for the URL to be activated and the application page to be effectively displayed in the browser.\n\n---\n\n## Deleting\n\nThe `delete` command is used when you want to delete an edge application.\n\n### Usage\n\n```bash\n    azioncli edge_applications delete --application-id 1234\n```\n\n### Flags \n\n#### Application id\nThe `--application-id` is the unique identifier of your edge application.\n\n#### Help\nThe `--help` option displays more information about the `describe` command.\n\n---\n\n## Describing\n\nThe `describe` command displays information about a specific edge application that matches the given ID, showing the application's attributes in detail.\n\n### Usage\n\n```bash\n    azioncli edge_applications describe --application-id 4312\n    azioncli edge_applications describe --application-id 1337 --out \"./tmp/test.json\" --format json\n    azioncli edge_applications describe --application-id 1337 --format json\n```\n\n### Flags\n\n#### Application ID\n\nThe `--application-id` option is the unique identifier of your edge application.\n\n#### Format\n\nThe `--format` option changes the output format passing the JSON value to the flag.\n\n#### Help\n\nThe `--help` option displays more information about the `describe` command.\n\n#### Out\n\nThe `--out` option exports the output to the given `<file_path/file_name.ext>`.\n\n---\n\n## Listing\n\nThe `list` command is used when you want to list your edge applications.\n\n### Usage\n\n```bash\n    azioncli edge_applications list\n```\n\n### Flags\n\n#### Details\n\nThe `--details` option displays all relevant fields of your edge application.\n\n#### Filter\n\nThe `--filter` option filters the applications by their names.\n\n#### Help\n\nThe `--help` option displays more information about the `describe` command.\n\n#### Order by\n\nThe `--order_by` option sorts the output based on the selected field.\n\n#### Page\n\nThe `--page` option returns a page of the list according to its number (default 1).\n\n#### Page size\n\nThe `--page_size` option defines how many items should be returned per page (default 10).\n\n#### Sort\n\nThe `--sort` option defines the order of the items on the list. The options are `<asc|desc>`.\n",

Go to our [releases page](https://github.com/aziontech/azion-cli/releases) and download the desired package.\n2. Execute the command in the **Install Command** column of the table below for the chosen installation package. The **CLI** will be installed automatically.\n\n> **Note**: replace the `<downloaded_file>` placeholder with the installation package file downloaded in step 1.\n\n| Package Manager | Website | Documentation | Install Command |\n| ---------------------- | ------------ | -------- | ----------- |\n| RPM | [RPM package manager](https://rpm.org/index.html) | [RPM Support Documentation](https://rpm.org/documentation.html) | `sudo rpm -i <downloaded_file>` |\n| Dpkg | [Debian&reg; <sup>5</sup> operating system](https://www.debian.org/) | [Dpkg Support Documentation](https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Dpkg)| `sudo dpkg -i <downloaded_file>` |\n| apk | [Alpine Linux&reg; <sup>6</sup>operating system](https://docs.alpinelinux.org/user-handbook/0.1a/Working/apk.html) | [support documentation apk](https://docs.alpinelinux.org/user-handbook/0.1a/Working/apk.html) | `apk add <downloaded_file>` |\n\n3. Run the `azioncli --version` command to test the installation. The CLI displays its installed current version number on the terminal.\n\n### Installing the CLI using Homebrew\n\n1. To use Homebrew, visit the [official package installer website](https://brew.sh/) and follow the installation instructions located on its homepage. Then run the Install Command below:\n\n| Package Manager | Website | Documentation | Install Command |\n| ---------------------- | ------------ | -------- | ----------- |\n| Homebrew | [Homebrew package manager](https://brew.sh/) | [Homebrew Support Documentation](https://docs.brew.sh/Manpage) | `brew install aziontech/tap/azioncli` |\n\n2. Run the `azioncli --version` command to test the installation. The CLI displays its installed current version number on the terminal.\n\n### Alternatives\n\nAlternatively, you can [install Azion CLI manually](/en/documentation/products/guides/cli-installing-manually/).\n\nIf you're installing the CLI on a macOS operating system, see [running Azion CLI on macOS](/en/documentation/products/guides/cli-running-macos/).\n\n---\n\n## Authorization on the Azion Platform\n\nTo manage your settings, you must generate a *token* that identifies you on the Azion platform.\n\n> For more information on how to create and manage your *tokens*, use the [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/#aab16606-2014-43d0-9b7a-dc564146a1ac) or see the [Personal Tokens](/en/documentation/products/accounts/personal-tokens/) documentation page.\n\nOnce you've created your personal token and have it on your clipboard you can locally store it by using the following command:\n\n```bash\n    $ azioncli configure --token <your_token>\n```\n\nAll subsequent commands will use that same *token* and will consider all permissions granted to the account that *token* belongs to.\n\n> You can replace your *Personal Token* at any time by repeating the command above.\n\n",

By using the **CLI**, you can create and manage services such as **Edge Functions** and **Edge Services**, as well as the provisioning of **Next.js** applications.\n\nVisit the framework's site at [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for more information.\n\n**Azion CLI** enables you to:\n\n- Manage Azion products.  \n- Create automation using scripts or CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) pipelines.  \n- Provision multiple services that make your application up with few commands.\n- Manage your Azion settings as code.\n\nFor an overview of the **CLI** commands, you can access its [reference documentation](https://github.com/aziontech/azion-cli/wiki/azioncli).\n\n> Azion CLI is currently in **Beta** version. Some functionalities can be modified until its release. Therefore, use it cautiously in production environments. While you try out the **Beta** version, our engineering team would love to hear from you in order to improve it. Contribute with your [feedback](https://forms.gle/uBBkyXZCVcrgpvAB8).\n\n## About Command-Line Interfaces  \n\nPrior to the development of **Graphical User Interfaces** (GUI), software developers and users interacted with computers using a keyboard and monitor, known as **terminal**.\n\nThe keyboard served as the input device, on which the user typed command lines. The computer then ran the command and output the result on the monitor screen, eventually with additional messages.\n\n> Commands typed on the keyboard followed rules that enabled creating an interface between the user and the computer. They were usually composed of a keyword, flags, and parameters. This interface, still used today, is the **Command-Line Interface** or **CLI**.\n\nLater, the GUIs attracted to the computer world users who found typing commands complex and challenging. However, the **CLI** has never lost its importance, especially in the software development environment.\n\nIn fact, the **CLI** has many advantages when compared to using graphical interfaces, such as:\n\n- Ability to manipulate computer resources inaccessible by GUIs.\n- Speed and simplicity to perform tasks.\n- Flexibility in creating scripts for process automation.\n\nAll modern operating systems have terminal-type applications in which the user can type command lines to perform tasks on the computer.\n",

It includes getting to know Azion's configuration interface, the [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/), building an **Edge Application** from scratch, and further setting up and connecting your newly created application to domains and traffic metrics.\n\n## Getting to know Real-Time Manager\n\n[Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/) is Azion’s configuration interface where you can access all the available products and their settings.\n\n![Real-Time Manager homepage](/assets/docs/images/uploads/rtm-home.png)\n\nFrom the homepage, you can see RTM's header. On the top left corner, you can find the **Products Menu**, where Azion products and their capabilities are available.\n\nYou'll also see a **Status** bar indicating how Azion's systems are operating. You can click the bar and check the status for each of the available [Edge Network's](https://www.azion.com/en/products/edge-network) locations.\n\nNext to the **Status** bar, you can click the **Help Center** button. It'll display a series of documentations related to the screen you are currently on and other helpful links.\n\n**Note**: Documentation related to RTM's screens in the **Help Center** may not be available for all screens at the moment.\n\nAt the top right corner, you can find the **Account Menu**, where you can see and update information related to your account.\n\nIn the *Getting Started* section, you'll find three shortcuts:\n\n* **Build an Edge Application:** this block will guide you through the initial steps to [building your first Edge Application from scratch](#build-edge-app) with the setup that best suits your needs.\n* **Manage your Domains:** use this block to visit the [Domains](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/domains/) page. There, you'll be able to manage and add domains to your applications.\n\n  > You can create a domain with a TLS certificate granted by Azion. You can also automate domain creation using our [API - Azion Domains](https://api.azion.com/#5b0cef3f-e2b2-4119-821a-e22f1ff1365e).\n\n* **View Edge Application Metrics:** here, you'll find insights based on your applications' performance, availability, and security. This link will take you to [Real-Time Metrics](/en/documentation/products/real-time-metrics/).\n\n![](/assets/docs/images/uploads/screen-shot-2022-05-10-at-17-28-01.png)\n\nOn the right side of **RTM's** homepage, you can find helpful links taking you to Azion's [documentation page](/en/documentation/products/), [changelogs](/en/documentation/products/changelog), Azion's [API library](https://api.azion.com/), and to contact our [Support team](https://tickets.azion.com/en/support/login).\n\nRight after the *Getting Started* section on the homepage, you can find a shortcut to **Invite Your Team** to Azion. This is an optional step but if you're constantly working with a team, inviting them can help you through configurations and the entire working process. Find out more about [Teams Permissions](/en/documentation/products/accounts/teams-permissions/).\n\nBelow the quick-access options, you can find Azion's product categories: **Build, Secure, Deploy, and Observe**. Each of these categories will guide you through your Azion journey and help you set up your applications. Read on to learn how you can explore each category:\n\n* **Build**: create and manage [Edge Applications](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/) and manage [Domains](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/domains/).\n* **Secure**: secure your applications by creating [Edge Firewalls](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/), managing your [Intelligent DNS](/en/documentation/products/intelligent-dns/), and operating [WAF](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/web-application-firewall/) rules.\n* **Deploy:** deploy [Edge Services](/en/documentation/products/edge-orchestrator/edge-services/), [Edge Nodes](/en/documentation/products/edge-orchestrator/edge-node/), and [Edge Orchestrator](/en/documentation/products/edge-orchestrator/).\n* **Observe:** visualize important data using [Real-Time Metrics](/en/documentation/products/real-time-metrics/), [Real-Time Events](/en/documentation/products/real-time-events/), [Data Streaming](/en/documentation/products/data-streaming/), and [Edge Pulse](/en/documentation/products/edge-pulse/).\n\n![](/assets/docs/images/uploads/screen-shot-2022-05-10-at-17-29-30.png)\n\n---\n\nAfter becoming familiar with RTM, you can continue your journey and build your Edge Application on Azion. The next few sections will provide clear instructions to the steps you need to take to configure an application and a domain, in addition to suggesting further steps and contents to enhance your application through Azion four categories—Build, Secure, Deploy, Observe.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1. Build an Edge Application from scratch\n\nBuilding an [Edge Application](/en/documentation/products/edge-application), which allows you to build your web applications to run on Azion's platform, is the first step to start using Azion Edge platform. This documentation assists you in every step of the journey of building an Edge Application from scratch with Azion’s platform and products.\n\nAfter logging in to [RTM](https://manager.azion.com/), in the **Getting Started** section on the homepage, click **Build an Edge Application** to start creating your own applications.\n\n> * Build with Edge Application\n> * Select the setup option\n> * Select a function\n\n## BUILD\n\nStep 1 of building your Edge Application from scratch is **Build**. You can build your application as you complete the set up presented to you. Next, you can find information about the required fields to have your Edge Application up and running.\n\n\nimport BuildFromScratch from \"~/includes/docs_help_center/en/build-application/build/build-from-scratch/build-with-edge-application/index.md\"\nimport SelectSetup from \"~/includes/docs_help_center/en/build-application/build/build-from-scratch/select-the-setup-option/index.md\"\nimport SelectFunction from \"~/includes/docs_help_center/en/build-application/build/build-from-scratch/select-a-function/index.md\"\n\n<BuildFromScratch />\n<SelectSetup />\n<SelectFunction />\n\n## Step 2. Launch an Edge Application\n\n> * Run a Function — Next Steps\n> * Fetch content from Origin — Next Steps\n> * Advanced Edge Application — Next Steps\n\n## LAUNCH\n\nStep 2 of building your Edge Application from scratch is **Launch**. In this step, you can find a summary of your newly created application and its link. And here, you can find a set of available options to finalize your application according to your chosen settings.\n\nimport RunFunctions from \"~/includes/docs_help_center/en/build-application/launch/run-a-function---next-steps/index.md\"\n\n<RunFunctions />\n\nimport FetchNextSteps from \"~/includes/docs_help_center/en/build-application/launch/fetch-content-from-origin---next-steps/index.md\"\n\n<FetchNextSteps />\n\nimport AdvancedConfig from \"~/includes/docs_help_center/en/build-application/launch/advanced-configuration---next-steps/index.md\"\n\n<AdvancedConfig />\n\n\nNow that you have already started your journey of moving to the edge, you can explore the rest of our documentation page and find out more about our [products](/en/documentation/products), our [APIs](https://api.azion.com/), and a few [use cases](/en/documentation/use-cases) selected for you.\n\n> Additionally, when you create your first edge application on Azion, you'll receive an email suggesting *Next Steps*. This way, you'll know some of the options to set up your applications and how to take advantage of Azion's edge platform.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3. Setting up an Edge Application\n\nAfter creating an application with the [Build from scratch](#build-edge-app) process, you can customize or edit its settings anytime you want.\n\nTo see what are your current settings and edit them, log in to [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/). From the homepage, follow these steps:\n\n1. Select the **Products Menu** on the top left corner.\n2. In the **Build** section, select **Edge Application**.\n3. From the list of your **Edge Applications**, choose the one you want to see or edit.\n\n**Note**: if you don't have an **Edge Application** yet, you can go back to the homepage and follow the steps from [Build from scratch](#build-edge-app) or click the **Add application** button on the **Edge Application** page.\n\nAfter selecting the **Edge Application** you'll work on, you'll be directed to a page with the following tabs:\n\n* Main Settings\n* Origins\n* Device Groups\n* Error Response\n* Cache Settings\n* Functions\n* Rules Engine\n\nThe **Device Groups**, **Error Response**, and [Rules Engine](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/rules-engine/) tabs are of optional use. The **Main Settings**, **Origins**, **Cache Settings**, and [**Functions**](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-functions/) tabs need to be configured to have your **Edge Application** running.\n\nSee how to configure the mandatory tabs next:\n\n### Main Settings\n\nIn this section, you'll define the main fields related to the delivery of your Applications: **HTTP** or **HTTP & HTTPS.** And, also, the **Minimum TLS version** and **Ports** fields need configuring.\n\n| Field               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [Delivery Protocol](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/#protocols) | Define the Delivery Protocol supported by your web application.<br /><br />HTTP: if your application only supports the HTTP protocol.<br /><br />HTTP & HTTPS: if your application supports both HTTP and HTTPS protocols.<br /><br />If you choose HTTP & HTTPS as the delivery protocols, you must enter the Minimum TLS version and set up a [Digital Certificate](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/digital-certificates/). |\n| [Ports](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/#ports) | Define which ports will be used by your edge application.<br /><br />Web servers may have different standards for HTTP or HTTPS ports. Choose one or more ports that are compatible with your web application. |\n| [Minimum TLS version](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/#minimum-tls-version) | Transport Layer Security (TLS) guarantees encrypted communications between a client and a web server via HTTPS. PCI standards recommend the use of TLS 1.2 or higher. Remember, if you use new versions, some older client devices or browsers won't be able to connect. |\n\n---\n\n### Origins\n\n**Origins** is where you define your origin data, an essential piece of information on your **Edge Application**. See what's necessary for each field below.\n\n\n | Field                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Origin Type            | The following fields refer to the Single Origin type.

In the reverse proxy architecture adopted by Azion, users connect to the edge nodes via HTTP or HTTPS, and you choose how you want Azion to connect to your origin:<br/>Preserve HTTP/HTTPS protocol: it'll keep the same connection protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) and ports used by your user when accessing your content on Azion to connect to your origin.<br/>Enforce HTTP: the connection between Azion’s Edge Nodes and your origin will be through HTTP, regardless of the connection protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) and ports used by your user to access Azion’s content. With this new option, you may customize a port to your origin in the Address field different from the default port (80 for HTTP) if you wish.<br/>Enforce HTTPS: the connection between Azion’s edge nodes and your origin will be through HTTPS, regardless of the connection protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) and ports used by your user to access Azion’s content. With this new option, you may customize a port to your origin in the Address field different from the default port (443 for HTTPS) if you wish. |\n| [Host Header](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/load-balancer/#host-header)            | This information is used to define which application should be accessed, enabling the origin server to distinguish among resources while servicing requests for multiple hostnames on a single IP address.<br/>Your origin uses the Host Header to identify the virtualhost and locate your content or Application. When setting up an origin in Real-Time Manager, you can customize the value that Azion must send in the host header.Use the value `${host}` in the Host Header field if your origin is configured to answer to virtualhost for the same domain that its users use to access the content on Azion. This way, you'll be instructing edge nodes to forward the same host header that is received from your visitors to their origin.<br/> If necessary, you can fill in a custom value for host header to be sent to your origin. For example, origin.domain.com. You must customize the host header if your origin is configured to respond to a virtualhost at a domain different than the one used by its users.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n\n---\n\n### **Cache Settings**\n\nIn this section, you'll define the **cache options** for your content.

You can define the time-to-live (TTL) for each content. Still,  you have little autonomy to force the content to expire before the time defined as TTL, in case there is a need to change the content ahead of time.Here, you can choose between honoring or overriding cache settings. That is, the time that content should be kept in the user's browser cache.<br/>Choose between Honor Origin Cache Headers or Override Cache Settings.<br/>Use Honor Origin Cache Headers option if you want Azion to send your users the same cache control headers Received from your origin.If you choose to Override Cache Settings, you must enter the TTL in seconds, which is how long content will stay in cache. |\n| [CDN Cache Settings](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-caching#cdn-cache-settings)     | Here, you define how your content is kept in cache on Azion’s Edge Nodes. In addition setting the TTL for each type of content, you'll be able to perform the Purge operation of the content in real time, whenever there is a need to delete the data stored in the cache.<br />Use the Honor Origin Cache Headers option if you want Azion to respect the cache control headers received from your origin, for managing the cache on Azion’s Edge Nodes. You can also customize the CDN Cache control by selecting the Override Cache Settings option. In this case, you must define a Maximum TTL, which is the maximum lifetime (in seconds) that the content can be cached in Azion’s Edge Nodes.                                                                                                           | \n\nAfter defining the previous information, click **Save** to finish this step.\n\nWatch the details about building and setting up your edge applications in this video tutorial on Azion's YouTube channel:\n\n\n<iframe\n    src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/a1YzTkJn9w4\"\n    loading=\"lazy\"\n    width=\"600\"\n    height=\"400\"\n    title=\"Get started with Azion Real-Time Manager\"\n    frameborder=\"0\"\n    allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\n    allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n## Step 4. Creating a new Domain associated with your Edge Application\n\nNow that you have finished setting up your **Edge Application**, you must configure a [*Domain*](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/domains/) for it. This process is very important as you'll need to have *Domains* configured to connect your Edge Application to other Azion products.\n\nOn [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/), your main domain (example: `myapp.com`) and all your *subdomains* (example: `user.myapp.com`) must each be configured as a standalone *domain*.\n\nTo access the **Domains** configuration page, you can click on **Manage your Domains** from the **RTM** homepage. You can also find `Domains` on the **Products Menu**.\n\n> If you have just created an **Edge Application** in the *Build from scratch* process, you can find the **Domains** page on the **What do you want to do next?** section on the **Launch** page.\n\nOn the **Domains** page, you can see all your **Edge Applications** listed. To set up a **Domain**, follow the steps below:\n\n1. Click on **Add Domain**.\n1. In **Add Configuration Name**, choose a name for your domain.\n> You can use the same name as your *domain name*.\n1. Select the [**Digital Certificate**](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/digital-certificates) you'll use — it can be the standard *Azion (SAN)* or any third party Digital Certificate.\n1. Write all [Canonical Names (CNAMES)](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/domains#cname) your domain has.\n1. If you want your users to access your application by CNAME only, activate the **CNAME Access Only** switch.\n1. In **Edge Application**, select the one your **Domain** will be connected to from the dropdown list.\n1. Make sure the **Active** switch is on.\n1. Click the **Save** button.\n\n### Required fields to add a certificate on Domains\n\n| Field | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| [Digital Certificate](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/digital-certificates) | The usual setup is to use Azion's certificate. If you'd like to add another certificate, go to the **Products Menu** on **RTM** and look for the Digital Certificates section.<br /><br />If you've selected HTTP & HTTPS during the creation of your Edge Application, you must select the TLS certificate that will be used to encrypt your HTTPS traffic. Azion provides the Azion (SAN) certificate that can be used for `map.azionedge.net` |\n| [CNAMEs](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/domains#cname)              | Configure the list of delivery domains (CNAMEs) for your content or application. If necessary, you can use a Wildcard Domain (`*.yourdomain.com`). Example: `www.azion.com`<br /><br />List the domains you want to use as a URL for your files by hitting enter.<br /><br />Thus, you replace the address provided by Azion (for example, 10001.map.azionedge.net) with the listed domains.<br /><br />In this case, you should register the CNAMEs in your DNS service to redirect any routes of your CNAME to those indicated by Azion.<br /><br />For example, replace `www.example.com` with `10001.map.azionedge.net`. |\n| CNAME Access Only  | By default, all Domain configurations are automatically assigned a domain name below map.azionedge.net<br /><br />By checking this option, you'll be configuring the **Edge Application** to deliver your content or applications only through the domains listed in the CNAME field. |\n| [Edge Application](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/)   | Select the **Edge Application** you want to associate with this delivery domain. |\n\n> Learn more about [**Digital Certificates**](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/digital-certificates).\n\n---\n\n## Step 5. Pointing your traffic to Azion\n\nNow that you've associated a custom *Domain Name System (DNS)* with your **Edge Application** on **RTM**, you need to configure it with your DNS provider. Your DNS provider must know where to find your application and what to return to users that access `myapp.com`.\n\n> This process won't simply `redirect` users that access `myapp.com` to `<edge_application_id>.map.azionedge.net` but link your application to your DNS — and all CNAMES associated with it.\n\nOr, you can rely on Azion **Intelligent DNS** to create, host, and secure your domains. Learn more about domains and how Azion [Intelligent DNS](/en/documentation/products/intelligent-dns) works.\n\nIf you choose to use a third-party *DNS provider*, such as GoDaddy, OpenDNS, Namecheap, and so on, this configuration must be completed outside Azion **RTM** interface and on your *DNS provider user panel*.\n\nTo link your application with a DNS, go to your *DNS provider user panel* and look for \"*DNS Configuration*\" or \"*DNS Manager*\".\n\n> Configuration settings may change according to different providers.\n\nInside the *DNS Manager*, **add the link** to your Edge Application (`<edge_application_id>.map.azionedge.net`) on the *DNS Host Record* field.\n\nSave it, wait a few minutes, and check to see if it works.\n\nYou can confirm the incoming traffic through [Real-Time Metrics](/en/documentation/products/real-time-metrics/).\n\nYour application should now be accessible by typing your DNS as a URL.\n",

You can apply these rules to a dynamic application using [Rules Engine](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/rules-engine/).\n\n> If you want to configure cache settings for static content, see the guide on [How to configure cache policies for Edge Application](/en/documentation/products/guides/edge-caching/).\n\nTo activate **Advanced Cache Key** for an edge application:\n\n1. Access [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).\n2. On the upper-left corner of the page, select **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines.\n3. Under **BUILD**, click **Edge Application**.\n4. Select the application you want to configure or [create a new one](/en/documentation/products/getting-started/).\n5. On the **Main settings** tab, under the **Modules** section, enable the **Application Acceleration** switch.\n6. Click the **Save** button.\n\n---\n\n## Creating advanced cache rules for dynamic content based on Query Strings\n\nTo illustrate the use of **Advanced Cache Key** based on Query Strings, assume your application has the following URL: `domain.com/page?city=city_name`.\n\nThe `/page` URI has an API, called by the Query String `?city=city_name` that lists the content depending on the user's city. The content of the page is automatically updated every five minutes.\n\nIn order to match the cache TTL with the update time of the content called by the `city` field:\n\n1. Access [RTM](https://manager.azion.com/).\n2. On the upper-left corner of the page, select **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines.\n3. Under **BUILD**, click **Edge Application**.\n4. Select the application and ensure **Application Acceleration** is active.\n5. Click on the **Cache Settings** tab.\n6. Click on the **Add Cache Settings** button and give your setting an easy-to-remember name.\n7. Both in the **Browser Cache Settings** and **CDN Cache Settings** sections:\n    - Check the option **Override Cache Settings**.\n    - Set the **Maximum TTL (seconds)** to `300` (5 minutes).\n8. In the **Advanced Cache Key** section, define your custom **Cache by Query String** as follows:\n    - Select the option **Content varies by some Query String fields (Whitelist)**.\n    - In **Query String fields**, enter the value `city`.\n9. Click the **Save** button.\n\nNow, there's a cache policy object with the Query String for `city` that can be activated in **Rules Engine** as follows:\n\n1. Click on the **Rules Engine** tab.\n2. Click the **Add Rule** button and select the **Request Phase**.\n3. In the **Criteria** section, set the criteria that triggers the behavior every time the URI `/page` is accessed as follows:\n\n    > If `${uri}` *starts with* `/page`\n\n4. In the **Behaviors** section:\n    - Select the **Set Cache Policy** behavior.\n    - Select the cache setting you created for the `city` Query String.\n5. Click the **Save** button.\n\nDone. Now the content in your application will be cached in the browser and at the origin for the same amount of time it takes for the API to refresh.\n\n---\n\n## Creating advanced cache rules for dynamic content based on Cookies\n\nIf your application uses cookie-based authentication, you can use the **Advanced Cache Key** to ensure that cached content will vary according to each session cookie.\n\nFor example, each time a user logs into their account on your edge application, they're directed to a `/profile` page. The contents of the profile page should vary depending on a cookie named `session_cookie` and the value it stores upon a successful login.\n\nTo ensure a user sees a different page depending on their session cookie:\n\n1. Access [RTM](https://manager.azion.com/).\n2. On the upper-left corner of the page, select **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines.\n3. Under **BUILD**, click **Edge Application**.\n4. Select the application and ensure **Application Acceleration** is active.\n5. Click the **Cache Settings** tab.\n6. Click the **Add Cache Settings** button and give your setting an easy-to-remember name.\n7. Configure **Browser Cache Settings** and **CDN Cache Settings** as desired.\n8. In the **Advanced Cache Key** section, define your custom **Cache by Cookie** as follows:\n    - Select the option **Content varies by some Cookies**.\n    - In **Cookie names**, enter the value `session_cookie`.\n9. Click the **Save** button.\n\nThe next step is to activate a rule in **Rules Engine** for the `/profile` page as follows:\n\n1. Click on the **Rules Engine** tab.\n2. Click the **Add Rule** button and select the **Request Phase**.\n3. In the **Criteria** section, set the criteria that triggers the behavior every time the URI `/profile` is accessed as follows:\n\n    > If `${uri}` starts with `/profile`\n\n4. In the **Behaviors** section:\n    - Select the **Set Cache Policy** behavior.\n    - Select the cache setting you created for the `session_cookie`.\n5. Click the **Save** button.\n\nDone. Now the cached object for the profile page will vary based on the user's session cookie.\n",

    "body": "\n**Network Layer Protection** is a module within **Edge Firewall** from Azion’s Edge Computing platform. It allows you to create custom *Network Lists* based on the user's IP, ASN, and geolocation addresses, or to use automatic lists that are maintained and updated by Azion, such as the Tor network address list.\n\nThis allows you to monitor suspicious behavior, create intelligent rules, and apply restrictions on malicious activity by blocking or limiting access and giving protection to your applications’ incoming and outgoing traffic in the network layer on the Edge.\n\nSome of the other advantages of using Azion’s **Network Layer Protection** are:\n\n* Easy to integrate with SIEM and other security tools in your infrastructure using blocklist maintenance APIs.\n* Processing on the Edge in real-time, enabling the origin infrastructure to maintain its level of performance.\n* The option to run business rules on the Edge.\n\n## How it works\n\nThe **Network Layer Protection** service uses a series of lists maintained by the user themselves or by Azion, which can be updated manually or via an API. When a request reaches an Azion Edge Node, it is assessed and, if it meets the criteria set in the Rule Set for that Edge, the configured lists are queried, thereby filtering out known offenders even before the request reaches the client’s infrastructure.\n\nWhen activating the module within an **Edge Firewall**, the *Network Criteria* and the *Deny*, *Drop*, and *Set Rate Limit Behaviors* become available in the *Rules Engine* settings of the selected *Rule Set*. This allows the client to define under what conditions the lists will be queried and what behaviors should be executed.\n\n## Activating the Network Layer Protection module\n\nTo enable the **Network Layer Protection** module, access **Real-Time Manager (RTM)**, open the **Products Menu**, and select *Edge Firewall*. Then, in the **Main Settings** tab, activate the **Network Layer Protection** switch.\n\nOnce enabled, custom lists need to be created along with the evaluation criteria and behaviors set that will be applied by the **Edge Firewall**.\n\n## Creating a Network List\n\nPath: **Real-Time Manager** > **Edge Libraries** > **Network Lists**\n\nWhen opening the *Network Lists* page, all lists created by the user and those items automatically provided by Azion will be displayed, such as [**Origin Shield**](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/network-layer-protection/#origin-shield).\n\nTo create a new one, click the *Add* button, choose an identifiable *name* for your list (for example, *BlockedIPsList*, for a list of known malicious IPs), select the desired *Type*, and complete the list according to the type you have chosen (*ASN*, *Countries* or *IP / CIDR*. For our example, we are using the IP/CIDR option), and then click *Save*. The user’s list can be updated anytime, either manually or integrated through an API.\n\nExample of the configuration of an IP/CIDR type list:\n\n```\n123.456.789.1\n123.456.789.2/32\n10.1.1.0/16\n```\n\n## Defining the Execution criteria\n\nPath: **Real-Time Manager** > **Edge Firewall** > **Rules Engine**\n\nCreate a new *Rule Set* inside your **Edge Firewall** or edit an existing one. The rules (or *Rules Engines*) determine the set of conditions that need to be met for *Behaviors* to be executed. You can create a new rule to set the validation parameters and the behaviors for this *Rule Set* to be run by **Edge Firewall**.\n\nDefining the validation criteria: choose the *variables*, *comparison operators*, and *strings* to create your business rule, as in the following example:\n\n* If: Network matches BadBotsList\n\n> In order: logical operator, variable, comparison operator, string.\n\nIn this case, the rule will run if the IP address of the request is on the list *BadBotsList*.\n\nDefining Behaviors: add the behaviors you want to be carried out when the rule's conditions are met. Example:\n\n* Then: Drop (Close Without Response)\n\n> In order: logical operator, action.\n\nIn this example, if the conditions set by the rules are met, then a *Drop* will be run for the request without sending any return to the sender.\n",

The command's text will be automatically supplemented.\n\nTo install the CLI Autocomplete functionality, visit the [Setup Autocomplete](https://github.com/aziontech/azion-cli/blob/dev/README.md#setup-autocomplete) topic.\n\n> **Tip**: after installing the Autocomplete feature, remember to *restart the terminal* to activate the functionality.\n\nRun some tests to familiarize yourself with Autocomplete. Here's how to quickly type the `azioncli edge_applications init` command with little effort:\n\n> **Note**: the &rarr; symbol equals to the `tab` key on the keyboard.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`az` &rarr; `w` &rarr; `i` &rarr;\n\nThe result will be the text `azioncli edge_applications init` with the keystroke of only 7 keys instead of 20, considering that the functionality automatically includes a blank space after each command.\n\nIf the text complement has more than one command or subcommand option, Autocomplete automatically shows a list of options when pressing the &rarr; key. Try the example below:\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`az` &rarr; `e` &rarr; &rarr;\n\n```bash\n    user@computer ~ % azioncli edge_\n    edge_functions -- Manages your Azion account Edge Functions\n    edge_services -- Manages your Azion account Edge Services\n```\n\nWhen you type the last &rarr;, Autocomplete presents a list with two subcommands and their respective short descriptions. To select one of them, repeatedly press the &rarr; until you choose the desired subcommand. Then, press the space key on the keyboard to finish entering the command.\n\nNow all you have to do is enjoy the usefulness and functionality of **Autocomplete** to speed up the development of your projects with **Azion CLI**!\n\nYou can also follow the specific guides for each command with more detailed explanations on how to explore the full potential of the CLI:\n\n- [Edge Functions Command](/en/documentation/products/cli/edge-functions/)\n- [Edge Applications Command](/en/documentation/products/cli/edge-applications/})\n",

    "body": "\nThis guide presents the steps for creating an edge application using the **Azion CLI** commands.\n\n**Requirements**:\nBefore starting to build your edge application, you need to:\n\n- Download and install the **Node.js** JavaScript runtime compatible with your operating system from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). This installation includes the `npm` package manager.\n- Download and install the **Azion CLI**, version `0.46.0` or higher, as shown in the [topic Installing](/en/documentation/products/cli/first-steps/#installing).\n- Create a *personal token* in **Real-Time Manager** and configure it in CLI. See the [Authorization on the Azion Platform](/en/documentation/products/cli/first-steps/#auth-azion) documentation.\n\nTo create an edge application using the CLI with the *JavaScript template*, follow these steps:\n\n1. Start a **Node.js** project in your application folder with the command `npm init -y`.\n2. Create a file called `index.js` with the application code.\n3. Run the command:\n\n    `azioncli edge_applications init --name \"my-app\" --type javascript`\n\n4. Run the command:\n\n    `azioncli edge_applications build`\n\n5. Run the command:\n\n    `azioncli edge_applications publish`\n\nThe CLI response will be *similar* to the example below:\n\n        Building your edge Application\n\n        Your edge Application was built successfully\n        Created Edge Function my-app with ID 1909\n        Created Edge Application my-app with ID 123456789\n        Created Domain my-app with ID 123456789\n        Your edge Application was published successfully\n\n        To visualize your application access the domain: xxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net\n\n        Content is being propagated to all Azion POPs and it might take a few minutes for all edges to be up to date\n\n6. Use the URL that appears at the end of the message in step 5 to open your edge application in your Internet browser.\n\n> **Note**: publishing an edge application via RTM or CLI isn't an instantaneous process. There is a time to propagate and configure the application in Azion's edge locations. It may be necessary to wait a few minutes for the URL to be activated and the application page to be effectively displayed in the browser.\n\nBrowse RTM to view the new elements that the CLI commands created in this guide.\n\n> **Tip**: if you want to retrieve your application's URL, [on Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/), select **Products Menu** > **Domains**. You'll see a list of your domains, including the one created by the CLI commands in this guide.\n",

    "body": "\nManage your edge functions using the **Azion CLI**. It's common for an edge application to use several functions present in an **Edge Library**.\n\n\n## 1. Prerequisites\n\n- Install Azion CLI.\n- [Create a personal token](/en/documentation/products/accounts/personal-tokens/) or use an existing one that identifies you on the Azion's platform.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Listing you functions \n\nInitially, you can list the edge functions available in your library, including the pre-configured `Azion - Hello World` function.\n\nTo list your edge functions, run the command:\n\n```bash\n    azioncli edge_functions list\n```\n\nA list of your functions will be presented on the monitor, as in this example:\n\n```bash\n    ID      NAME                   LANGUAGE      ACTIVE\n    3976    Azion - Hello World    javascript    true\n    6598    func01                 javascript    true\n```\n\nThe `azioncli edge_functions list` command responded with a table consisting of four columns:\n\n- **ID**: unique identifier of the edge function on the Azion's platform.\n- **NAME**: name of the function.\n- **LANGUAGE**: programming language or framework of the function.\n- **ACTIVE**: status of the function, which can be active (**true**) or inactive (**false**).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Creating an edge function\n\nCreate a new edge function directly from the **CLI**, without having to resort to **RTM**. Initially, we'll need a **JavaScript** file containing the function code. If you don't have a file in the current directory, create one with the command below:\n\n```bash\n    echo \"alert('My new JavaScript function');\" > my-func.js\n```\n\nAfter running the command, verify the creation of the `my-func.js` file with the `ls` command.\n\nNow that you have a file with the JavaScript function, you can create your edge function with it. To do so, type the following command:\n\n```bash\n    azioncli edge_functions create --name my-new-ef --code ./my-func.js --active true\n```\n\nCLI response:\n\n```bash\n    Created Edge Function with ID 6823\n```\n\nThe CLI responds with the **ID** of the newly created function. To confirm it, use the **list** command again:\n\n```bash\n    azioncli edge_functions list\n```\n\nCLI response:\n\n```bash\n    ID      NAME                   LANGUAGE      ACTIVE\n    3976    Azion - Hello World    javascript    true\n    6598    func01                 javascript    true\n    6823    my-new-ef              javascript    true\n```\n\nRelative to the list in the previous example, this time the **list** command included the `my-new-ef` function with ID *6823*, created by the **create** command.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Deleting an edge function\n\nTo delete the newly created `my-new-ef` function, run the **delete** command with the **ID** parameter of the function:\n\n```bash\n    azioncli edge_functions delete --function-id 6823\n```\n\nCLI response:\n\n```bash\n    Edge Function 6823 was successfully deleted\n```\n\nRun the **list** command again. The CLI will present the following table:\n\n```bash\n    ID      NAME                   LANGUAGE      ACTIVE\n    3976    Azion - Hello World    javascript    true\n    6598    func01                 javascript    true\n```\n\nNote that the `my-new-ef` function, whose **ID** was *6823*, no longer appears in the list. As a suggestion, you can access **RTM** to analyze the results of the CLI commands presented in this example.\n",

To use another architecture, change the URL to the desired operating system or architecture with the command below:\n\n    `curl -O https://downloads.azion.com/linux/x86_64/azioncli`\n\n3. Copy the `azioncli` file, downloaded in the previous step, to the folder created in step 1.\n4. Open the terminal and change the working directory to the folder you created in step 1 by running the `cd <path>` command with the path of the `my-cli` folder on your computer.\n5. Confirm the existence of the `azioncli` binary file in the project folder with the `ls` command.\n\n     Terminal response:\n\n         `azioncli`\n\n6. Grant permission to run the `azioncli` binary on your computer with the following command:\n\n    `chmod +x azioncli`\n\nIf the terminal doesn't display any messages, it means that the command was executed without errors.\n\n**Note**: if your computer uses the macOS operating system, it'll present a window with an error message preventing the execution of the CLI. See the procedure to [allow the CLI to run on the macOS operating system](/en/documentation/products/guides/cli-running-macos/), presented later.\n\n7. Run the command:\n\n> **Note**: the command below allows you to run `azioncli` from any folder on your computer's file system. You can then delete the `azioncli` files in your project directory and the `Downloads` folder by running the `rm azioncli` command in the respective directories.\n\n    `sudo cp azioncli /usr/local/bin`\n  \nThis command is *optional*. In case you didn't want to run the `sudo cp azioncli /usr/local/bin` command, remember to have a copy of the `azioncli` binary in your project folder and run it with the characters `./` in front, as in `./azioncli <command>`. Otherwise, an error message will be displayed stating that the `azioncli` command wasn't found.\n    \nThe `sudo` command asks for the password of the user with computer administrator powers. Enter your password and press the **ENTER** or **RETURN** key. Characters aren't displayed while typing.\n\n8. Test the **CLI** installation with the following command; a help screen will appear on the monitor.\n\n    `azioncli --help`\n\nIf a window with an alert message appears on the screen informing you that the developer can't be identified, click on the **Cancel** button. The terminal responds with the following message:\n\n    `zsh: killed azioncli --help`\n\nThen, follow the steps in the [Running the CLI on macOS Operating System](/en/documentation/products/guides/cli-running-macos/) topic. After releasing the execution, rerun the command `azioncli --help` or `azioncli --version` to verify that Azion CLI is working normally.\n\nIf you use the `azioncli --version` command, the response should be similar to the one shown below, or a higher version:\n\n    `azioncli version 0.46.0`\n\n> **Note**: the CLI release process presented above is for the macOS operating system. If you use another operating system, follow the procedures provided in the system's documentation.\n\nFrom now on you can run CLI commands.

The content of a static page is predefined and remains the same for all users\n                  who\n                  visit the page. It is typically created using HTML, CSS, and sometimes JavaScript.</p>\n              <p>Static pages are suitable for displaying information that doesn't need to be frequently updated or\n                  personalized. They are easy to create and host since they consist of simple HTML files that can be\n                  served\n                  directly by a web server without the need for server-side processing or a database.</p>\n              <p>On the other hand, a non-static or dynamic web page is generated on the server-side or client-side in\n                  real-time in response to user requests or events. The content of a dynamic page can vary based on\n                  factors\n                  such as user input, database records, session information, or external data sources.</p>\n              <p>Dynamic pages often utilize server-side programming languages like PHP, Python, or JavaScript (Node.js)\n                  to\n                  generate the HTML dynamically. They can fetch data from databases, perform calculations, process user\n                  input, and generate personalized content on the fly. Dynamic pages enable interactive and personalized\n                  web\n                  experiences, such as social media feeds, e-commerce sites, web applications, and more.</p>\n              <p>In summary, the main difference between static and dynamic pages is that static pages have fixed content\n                  and\n                  require manual updates, while dynamic pages are generated on the fly and can provide personalized and\n                  interactive content based on various factors.</p>\n          </article>\n      </div>\n  \n      <footer class=\"footer\">\n          <a href=\"https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/cli/\" target=\"_blank\">Azion CLI Documentation</a>\n      </footer>\n  </body>\n  \n  </html>\n```\n\n2.

Or, you can navigate through the pre-set templates on RTM by clicking on the **Template** dropdown menu and then copying the variables you desire.\n\nHere's an example of a custom template for the **Edge Applications** data source. The pre-set template currently contains about 50 variables, but you may only need 10 variables for your data analysis. Then, you can add the variables you want to use in the **Data Set** code box:\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"time\": \"$time\",\n    \"session_id\": \"$session_id\",\n    \"host\": \"$host\",\n    \"status\": \"$status\",\n    \"bytes_sent\": \"$bytes_sent\",\n    \"upstream_bytes_received\": \"$upstream_bytes_received\",\n    \"server_port\": \"$server_port\",\n    \"remote_port\": \"$remote_port\",\n    \"country\": \"$country\",\n    \"state\": \"$state\"\n}\n```\n\nAfter adding the variables of your choice:\n\n1. Fill in the remaining mandatory fields to configure your data streaming.\n2. Make sure the **Active** switch is on.\n3. Click **Save**.\n\nNow, your configured data streaming will send only the data related to the variables you added in the Custom Template.\n",

Create [a Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) account.\n2. Create [a project](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project) on the Google Cloud Platform. The **Project ID** will be given while you create it, make sure to save it.\n3. Create a [service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create) on the Google Platform.\n4. The service account must have the **BigQuery Admin** permissions. Make sure you select that option in the **Role** dropdown list.\n\n> For more details about the standard permissions assigned to the role of data editor of BigQuery, access [BigQuery Roles](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#bigquery-roles).\n\nYou'll also need to create and configure the following information:\n\n- Enable the BigQuery API\n- A dataset\n- A service account key\n\n### Enabling BigQuery API\n\nNext, you must access the [API Manager](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library) and enable the **BigQuery API**.\n\nThe BigQuery API supports an endpoint to stream rows into a table. However, this endpoint isn't supported in the Free Tier version. To use it, it's necessary to enable the full version of the platform with the billing configuration.\n\nFind more details on this step in the [documentation of Billing management on projects](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project). You can consult the fees for this API in the **Streaming Inserts** section's price table.\n\n### Creating a dataset\n\nAfter enabling the API, you'll need to create a dataset. To do so, you must first have created a project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery). By default, BigQuery is already enabled in new projects.\n\nAfter creating the project, follow these steps:\n\n1. On your Google Cloud console, open the BigQuery page.\n2. Select the project you want to create a dataset on.\n3. Click the **Actions** option, with the vertical ellipsis > **Create dataset**.\n4. Fill in the [required information](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/datasets#create-dataset). After choosing a **Dataset ID**, make sure to save it.\n5. Click **Create dataset**.\n\nAfter creating a dataset, you must create a table:\n\n1. [Create a table](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/tables) and associate it to the dataset you've just created.\n2. Make sure you save the **Table** name you choose. That's the Table ID.\n3. On **Schema**, add the structure of the data that will be inserted.\n4. Click **Create table**.\n\nOnce you create the table, it's possible to ingest data through the BigQuery API.\n\n### Creating a service account key\n\nNext, you must create a private key to continue your configuration.\n\n1. After creating the service account, access your service account.\n2. On the left menu, click **IAM & Admin** > **Service Accounts**.\n3. Select the service account you've created from the list.\n4. Click on the **KEYS** tab on the upper menu > **ADD KEY** > **Create new Key**.\n5. On **Key Type**, choose the **JSON** option > **CREATE**.\n6. After the confirmation, a **JSON file** will be automatically downloaded with the credentials.\n\nThe file's content should look similar to this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"type\": \"service_account\",\n  \"project_id\": \"azion-data\",\n  \"private_key_id\": \"13e018d99d6ay9e3c9f3e21a7a7e0226a1ae082\",\n  \"private_key\": \"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\\\\nxxx\\\\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\\\\n\",\n  \"client_email\": \"myemail@azion.com\",\n   ...\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Configuring the endpoint in Data Streaming\n\nNext, follow these steps to configure the new endpoint you created in **Google BigQuery** in your Azion **Data Streaming**.\n\nYou can find detailed steps for the entire configuration on the [How to use Data Streaming guide](/en/documentation/products/guides/use-data-streaming/).\n\nIn the **Destination** configurations:\n\n1.

Make sure to activate any rule set you wish to include in the debugging process.\n\n---\n\n## Debugging rules with the GraphQL API\n\n> See the [GraphQL API documentation](/en/documentation/products/graphql-api-overview) for more information.\n\nTo query the available rules data in the **GraphQL API**, follow the steps described on [How to query GraphQL requests on Postman](/en/documentation/products/guides/query-graphql-postman/) using the `https://api.azionapi.net/events/graphql` URL.\n\nThen, on Postman’s GraphQL request code box, add the following **HTTP Query**, modifying the `tsRange` to fit the time interval you want:\n\n```graphql\nquery HttpQuery {\n  httpEvents(\n    limit: 10,\n    filter: {\n      tsRange: {begin:\"2023-02-14T10:10:10\", end:\"2023-02-15T10:10:10\"}\n    }\n    orderBy: [ts_ASC]\n  ) \n  {\n    ts\n    remoteAddress\n    requestUri\n    stacktrace\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe example above shows a query for rule data using the **HTTP Events** dataset. The **limit** field filters the last 10 entries within the **tsRange** field. The presented data is ordered through the **ts** (timestamp) field.\n\nThe query above should return:\n\n- **ts**: the time range for when each request was initiated.\n- **remoteAddress**: the IP of the client that made the request to the application.\n- **requestUri**: the type of HTTP request and URI.\n- **stacktrace**: executed rules and rule sets.\n\nSend your request. You’ll receive a response similar to this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"data\": {\n    \"httpEvents\": [\n      {\n        \"ts\": \"2023-02-15T17:52:16Z\",\n        \"remoteAddress\": \"00.00.000.00\",\n        \"requestUri\": \"/get\",\n        \"stacktrace\": \"{\\\\\\\"edge_application_response\\\\\\\":[\\\\\\\"Add Azion Cookie\\\\\\\"],\\\\\\\"edge_firewall\\\\\\\":[\\\\\\\"Set WAF\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"Rate-Limit Root\\\\\\\"],\\\\\\\"edge_application_request\\\\\\\":[\\\\\\\"Default Rule\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"Test Send Cert to Origin 1\\\\\\\",\\\\\\\"Test Send Cert to Origin 2\\\\\\\"]}\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the **GraphQL API** has returned all active request and response phase rules created for **Edge Application**, as well as an active **Edge Firewall** rule set.\n\nFor more information on the **GraphQL API**, visit the [datasets documentation page](/en/documentation/products/graphql-api-features/#queries-datasets).\n\n---\n\n## Debugging rules using Data Streaming\n\n> See the [Data Streaming documentation](/en/documentation/products/data-streaming/) for more information on how to set it up.\n\n**To debug rules via Data Streaming, follow these steps:**\n\n1. [Access RTM](https://manager.azion.com/).\n2. Select **Products menu** > **Data Streaming**.\n3. Click **Add Streaming**.\n4. Choose a name for your data streaming.\n5. On the **Data Source** dropdown menu, select **Edge Applications**.\n6. On the **Template** dropdown menu, select **Custom Template**.\n7. On the **Data Set** code box, add the following variables:\n\n    ```json\n    {\n        \"time\": \"$time\",\n        \"traceback\": \"$traceback\"\n    }\n    ```\n\n8. On **Options**, select between **Filter Domains** or **All Domains**. See more about each option on [How to associate domains on Data Streaming](/en/documentation/products/guides/data-streaming-associate-domains/).\n9. On the **Destination** section, select an **Endpoint Type** on the dropdown menu.\n\n    > You'll see different fields depending on the endpoint type you choose. Find more information on each of them on the [Setting an endpoint page](/en/documentation/products/data-streaming/#setting-endpoint).\n\n10. Make sure the **Active** switch is turned on.\n11. Click the **Save** button.\n\nTo make sure your logs are being sent to your endpoint through the configured data streaming, you can use [Real-Time Events](/en/documentation/products/real-time-events/) to query detailed analysis.\n\nTo see all your created data streamings, go to the **Data Streaming** page on RTM and select one from the list. Feel free to create multiple ones.\n\n### Variables definition\n\n| Variable | Definition |\n| --- | --- |\n| $time | Request date and time. Example: Oct. 31st, 2022 - 19:30:41 |\n| $traceback | Provides the names of the rules created using Rules Engine for Edge Application and Edge Firewall that are run by the request. |\n\n---\n\n## Debugging rules using Real-Time Events\n\n> See the [Real-Time Events documentation](/en/documentation/products/real-time-events/) for more information on how to configure a data streaming endpoint.\n\n**To access Real-Time Events, follow these steps:**\n\n1. [Access RTM](https://manager.azion.com/).\n2. On the upper-left corner, select **Products menu** > **Real-Time Events**.\n3. On **Data Source**, select **Edge Applications**.\n4. Modify the desired time range and add filters if needed.\n5. Click the **Search** button.\n6. Select the log body you want to inspect.\n7. Look for the **traceback** field.\n\nThe **traceback** field should contain the type of rule executed and the behavior triggered within the selected time range. For instance:\n\n```yaml\n{\\\"edge_application_response\\\":[\\\"Add Azion Cookie\\\"],\\\"edge_firewall\\\":[\\\"Set WAF\\\",\\\"Rate-Limit Root\\\"],\\\"edge_application_request\\\":[\\\"Default Rule\\\",\\\"Test Send Cert to Origin 1\\\",\\\"Test Send Cert to Origin 2\\\"]}\n```\n\nIn this example, the **traceback** field contains all active request and response phase rules created for **Edge Application**, as well as an active **Edge Firewall** rule set.\n",

    "body": "\nAzion **Edge Application** can keep your content cached at the edge to support high-levels of demand without compromising quality or performance, resulting in a better user experience, faster load times, and lower maintenance costs.\n\nYou can optimize processing times by defining the time-to-live (TTL) for cached content at the origin and at the browser, bypass origin cache settings, and forward cookies with [Rules Engine](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/rules-engine/).\n\n> To configure cache settings for dynamic content, see the guide on [How to configure Advanced Cache Key for Edge Application](/en/documentation/products/guides/apis-performance-sites-application-acceleration/).\n\n## Creating and applying a cache setting for Edge Application \n\nIn order to customize cache policies, you must first enable the **Application Acceleration** module to extend the capabilities of **Rules Engine**. This will also allow you to change the cache TTL to values under 60 seconds.\n\nTo enable Application Acceleration, follow the steps:\n\n1. Access [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com).\n2. On the top-left corner of the page, go to **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines.\n3. Under the **BUILD** section, select **Edge Application**.\n4. Select the application you want to configure or [create a new one](/en/documentation/products/getting-started/).\n5. On the **Main settings** tab, under the **Modules** section, activate the **Application Acceleration** switch.\n6. Click the **Save** button.\n\nNow it's time to create a cache setting and customize cache policies. This is the point where you define how long you want your static content to remain in cache.\n\nTo create a new cache setting, follow the steps:\n\n1. Navigate to the **Cache Settings** tab of your application.\n2. Click the **Add Cache Settings** button.\n3. Enter an easy to remember name for your cache setting. For example: `/target-uri - Cache TTL`.\n4. In the **Expiration Settings**, you can customize your cache's TTL as follows:\n   - Under **Browser Cache Settings**, select **Override Cache Settings** to define how long your content can be cached in browsers.\n   - Under **CDN Cache Settings**, select **Override Cache Settings** to define how long your content can be cached at the edge.\n5. If you've chosen to override cache settings, add the desired **Maximum TTL** in seconds.\n   - At this point, you may also customize other cache settings for dynamic content provided by the [Advanced Cache Key](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/application-acceleration/#advanced-cache-key) feature.\n6. Click the **Save** button.\n\nNext, you must create a rule to apply the cache settings you've created. To do so, follow the steps:\n\n1. Navigate to the **Rules Engine** tab of your edge application.\n2. Click the **New Rule** button and select **Request Phase**.\n3. Enter an easy to remember name for your rule.\n4. In the **Criteria** section, set the desired criteria that will trigger the rule. To apply the cache settings to a specific URI:\n\n    > If `${uri}` *starts with* `/target-uri`\n\n5. In the **Behavior** section, select the **Set Cache Policy** behavior.\n6. In the argument field, select the `/target-uri - Cache TTL` cache setting.\n7. Click the **Save** button.\n\nDone. The cache settings you created will now be applied to the condition defined in the criteria. You can customize the rule further to suit the business needs of your application.\n\n---\n\n## Creating a rule to bypass cache from the origin\n\nIf you want to bypass origin cache policies, you can create a rule as follows:\n\n1. With the **Application Acceleration** module active, navigate to the **Rules Engine** tab of your edge application.\n2. Click the **New Rule** button and select **Request Phase**.\n3. Enter an easy to remember name for your rule. For example: `/target-uri - Bypass Cache`.\n4. In the **Criteria** section, set the desired criteria that will trigger the rule. To bypass cache from a specific URI:\n\n    > If `${uri}` *starts with* `/target-uri`\n\n5. In the **Behavior** section, select the **Bypass Cache** behavior.\n6. Click the **Save** button.\n\nBypass Cache only affects origin cache policies, not browser cache policies. You can customize browser cache through the **Set Cache Policy** behavior described above.\n\n> See the [Bypass Cache](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/application-acceleration/#bypass-cache) documentation to find out more about the difference between this behavior and TTL set to zero.\n\n---\n\n## Creating a rule to forward cookies from the origin to the user\n\nIf you want to forward the contents of the `Set-Cookie` header to your user, you can create a rule as follows:\n\n1. Navigate to the **Rules Engine** tab of your edge application.\n2. Click the **New Rule** button and select **Response Phase**.\n3. Enter an easy to remember name for your rule. For example: `/target-uri - Forward Cookies`.\n4. In the **Criteria** section, set the desired criteria that will trigger the rule. To forward cookies from a specific URI:\n\n    > If `${uri}` *starts with* `/target-uri`\n\n5. In the **Behavior** section, select the **Forward Cookies** behavior.\n6. Click the **Save** button.\n\n> To forward cookies from the user to the origin, you can create the same rule in the **Request phase**.\n\nNote that session cookies may be included in the **Forward Cookies** behavior. To prevent users from receiving cookies from private sessions:\n\n1. Navigate to the **Cache Settings** tab.\n2. Create a new setting by clicking **Add Cache Settings**.\n3. Enter an easy to remember name for your cache setting. For example: `/target-uri - Private cookies`.\n4. Under the **Advanced Cache Key** section, on **Cache by Cookie**, select the option **Content varies by cookies, except for a few**.\n5. List all session cookies you wish to keep private.\n6. Click the **Save** button.\n\nFinally, to activate the cache setting with the listed private cookies for the `/target-uri` page:\n\n1. Go to the **Rules Engine** tab.\n2. Select the `/target-uri - Forward Cookies` rule you created in the previous steps.\n3. In the **Behavior** section, click the **+ Behavior** button.\n4. Select the **Set Cache Policy** behavior.\n5. In the argument field, select the `/target-uri - Private cookies` cache policy.\n6. Click the **Save** button.\n\nYou can also combine this feature with the **Bypass cache** behavior described in the previous section.\n",

    "body": "\nFor online service providers like e-commerce, internet banking and media businesses, investing in security is as important as investing in the development of new applications, websites or integrating APIs. Every day, new threats are discovered and, in order to protect yourself from the activities of cybercriminals, it is necessary to constantly update security policies and adopt internet security tools, such as firewalls.\n\nThe high cost of maintaining an environment, that can both support a large number of requests and, at the same time, be protected from external threats, can make business expansion unfeasible. What’s more, they may be essential, but traditional security solutions can use up a lot of your infrastructure’s important resources, which can result in a loss of performance. Edge computing solutions, with their real-time processing, are a way you can both guarantee your applications’ security and maintain performance, at an affordable cost.\n\n## Real-time Security with Edge Computing \n\nThe Azion **Edge Firewall** is a multi-layered security platform that provides Edge Computing solutions to keep your applications, APIs and websites safer. By running directly at the edge of the network, our solutions are highly scalable and capable of dealing in real time with the *OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities*, mass attacks (DoS and DDoS) and even “zero-day” vulnerabilities, without any drop in performance by your services.\n\nSee how the Azion **Edge Firewall** can help you:\n\n* **Network Layer Protection**: constructs a security wall around your content, web applications and the source infrastructure. Protect yourself form the sort of data theft that can cause huge financial and reputational damage, blocking malicious attacks through smart rules that include network blocking (black and white lists of IP addresses, ASN numbers, countries or regions), limiting transfer rates, and more.\n* **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: create highly customizable rules, with real-time configuration updates, to protect any type of web application, including e-commerce, Content Management System (CMS) or internet banking, against the *OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities*, including critical attacks on the application layer, such as *SQL Injection*, or new and evolving threats.\n* **DDoS Protection** is the result of our globally distributed network and expertise in security, providing you with the skills and capacity you need to mitigate the risk from even the biggest and most complex of attacks, both at the network and the application layers.\n* **Edge Functions**: create and configure security functions, such as *ReCaptcha*, *JWT*, *Web Token* and *Bot Protection* among others, and protect the information that is important to your competitive strategy, such as price and content, from malicious attacks that consume bandwidth, increase traffic and compromise applications, as well as damaging your SEO rankings.\n\n## How it works \n\nBefore you begin, make sure that the **Edge Firewall** service and its modules are active on your Azion account.\n\nTo show how it works, we will configure **Edge Firewall** for an e-commerce store (`www.myecommerce.com`) as an example, and demonstrate how we will prevent a particular malicious website from redirecting traffic from our store. For this, we will configure a rule within **Edge Firewall** to block *Header HTTP Referer*.\n\nFrom **Real-Time Manager**, create a new configuration of **Edge Firewall** or edit an existing one. We will need to include your domain on the *Main Settings* tab, so that it can be protected by the rule. Save your rule set and next add a *New Rule* on the *Rules Engine* tab. Choose a name in the *Rule Engine* and define the activation criteria (Criteria). \n\nIn our example we are going to use the variable *Header Referer*, the operator *matches* and, for the string comparison, a fictitious address for a malicious site (`http://www.malicioussite.com`).\n\nNext, we simply configure a task in *Behavior* for our rule, in this case, we use the option `Deny (403 Forbidden)`. With this, we have established a rule by which every request to our shop that originates from the domain `malicioussite.com` will be blocked and will return the status code `HTTP 403`.\n\nTo take advantage of everything that Azion **Edge Firewall** has available, make sure you activate all the modules within **Edge Firewall**, on the *Main Settings* tab, through **Real-Time Manager**.\n",

Add the `handleRequest` function, containing a `switch case`, with a `GET` and a `POST` method:\n\n```js\nasync function handleRequest(request) {\n  switch (request.method) {\n    case 'POST':\n      return new Response(JSON.stringify(myObject), { // Returning the object generated by ChatGPT\n        headers: {\n          \"content-type\": \"application/json\",// Altering the content-type to application/json\n        }\n      })\n    case 'GET':\n      return new Response(html, {\n        headers: {\n          \"content-type\": \"text/html:charset=UTF-8\",\n        }\n      })\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- The `POST` method returns a `JSON` object, that was generated by the `ChatGPT: Generate` option.\n- The `GET` method returns the HTML `const` that was declared on step 6.\n\n10. Copy and paste the `PreviewProvider` function, responsible for simulating requests:\n\n```js\n    function PreviewProvider(args) {\n      var request = {\n        body: {},\n        headers: {},\n        method: \"GET\", \n        redirect: \"\",\n      }\n      return handleRequest(request)\n    }\n```\n\n11. Add the `addEventListener` function, which triggers the whole processing of the edge function:\n\n```js\n    addEventListener(\"fetch\", event => {\n            return event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))\n          })\n```\n\n12. Click with the right button anywhere inside the code editor and select **Format Document**.\n\nAt this point, your edge function should look like this:\n\n```js\n\n    /*\n    ChatGPTKey=sk-xxxxxxx\n    ChatGPTOrg=org-xxxxxx\n    */\n    const html = `<!DOCTYPE html>\n    <body>\n      <h1>Hello World</h1>\n      <p>This markup was generated by Azion - Edge Functions.</p>\n    </body>`\n\n    let myObject = {\n            property_1: 'value_1',\n            property_2: 10,\n            property_3: true,\n            property_4: [{object_1: 'value_1'}, {object_2: 'value_2'}],\n            property_5: [{object_3: 'value_3'}, {object_4: 'value_4'}]\n        };\n\n    async function handleRequest(request) {\n      switch (request.method) {\n        case 'POST':\n          return new Response(JSON.stringify(myObject), { // Returning the object generated by ChatGPT\n            headers: {\n              \"content-type\": \"application/json\",// Altering the content-type to application/json\n            }\n          })\n        case 'GET':\n          return new Response(html, {\n            headers: {\n              \"content-type\": \"text/html:charset=UTF-8\",\n            }\n          })\n      }\n    }\n\n     function PreviewProvider(args) { \n      var request = {\n        body: {},\n        headers: {},\n        method: \"GET\", //or POST\n        redirect: \"\",\n      }\n      return handleRequest(request)\n    }\n\n      addEventListener(\"fetch\", event => {\n        return event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))\n      })\n```\n\nIf you want, you can switch the method inside the `PreviewProvider` function and get a live preview of the responses on the [Azion Preview Deployment](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-functions/runtime-api/preview-deployment/).\n\n13. Click the **Save** button.\n\nNow, the function is ready to be instantiated in an edge application.

They can help you secure your applications through Edge Firewall.\n\nTo use functions in your Edge Firewall, you have to go through two steps:\n\n- Create an edge function with the *Initiator Type* set as Edge Firewall.\n- Configure the behaviors on the Edge Firewall page.\n\n---\n\n## Creating an edge function\n\n1. On [Real-Time Manager RTM](https://manager.azion.com/), on the upper-left corner, select **Edge Functions** in the **Edge Libraries** section.\n2. Click on **Add a Function**.\n3. Choose a name for your function.\n4. Write your Edge Function code, or simply paste it.\n    > **Note**: the edge function being used on the firewall must contain a *finishing event*, such as:\n\n    ```js \n    addEventListener(\"firewall\", (event) => {\n        event.deny();\n    });\n    ```\n\n5. Once you've placed the source code inside the code block, set the `Initiator Type` to `Edge Firewall`.\n6. Save it.\n\nNow, your edge function can be used on an edge firewall configuration.\n\n---\n\n## Configuring your edge function on the Edge Firewall \n\nAfter creating an edge function with the `Initiator type` set as Edge Firewall, you need to configure the edge firewall to use it.\n\n### 2.1 Creating a Rules Set\n\n1. On [Real-Time Manager RTM](https://manager.azion.com/), on the upper-left corner, select **Edge Firewall** in the **Secure** section.\n2. Click on **Add a Rule Set**.\n3. Choose a name for the Rules Set.\n4. Choose the domains you want to apply the rules to.\n5. Enable the use of the **Edge Functions** module.\n6. Activate the edge firewall and save it.\n\nAfter saving the configuration, on the same page, the tabs **Functions** and **Rules Engine** become available.\n\n### 2.2 Adding an edge function to the firewall\n\n1. Go to the **Functions** tab.\n2. Choose an **Instance Name**.\n3. Select **Add Function**.\n4. Choose a function.\n5. Click the **Save** button.\n    > **Note**: only functions with the *Initiator Type* set as Edge Firewall are listed.\n\n6. Go to the **Rules Engine** tab.\n7. Select **New Rule**.\n8. Write a name for the new rule.\n9. Configure the criteria that will be applied.\n10. Set the behavior to **Run Function** and select the function you want to run.\n11. Click the **Save** button.\n\n> **Note**: it might take a while for your changes to propagate.\n",

    "body": "\n**Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)** is a mechanism for using HTTP headers to give access permission for specific resources that are on a different origin server from the one the document is located. However, a CORS policy can block a request from a resource located in another domain different than the domain in use.\n\nTo fix this error, let's use the following example to guide our explanation:\n\nDomains:\n\n- `http://a.domain.com/` (origin)\n- `http://b.domain.com/` (destination)\n\nError message:\n\nAccess to XMLHttpRequest at `http://a.domain.com/page-cors-subdomain-a.txt' from origin 'http://b.domain.com' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.\n\nTo solve this type of error, configure your browser on [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/) using [Rules Engine](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/rules-engine/).\n\nOn Google Chrome, proceed as follows:\n\n1. Select **View** `>` **Developer** `>` **Developer tools**.\n2. Select the **Network** tab.\n3. Click the first line **page-cors-subdomain.a.html** and observe the **Request URL** information presented on the panel located on the right of the page.\n4. Click **Test CORS on click** and observe the red line in the **Name** section.\n5. Place the cursor over the **page-cors-subdomain-a.txt** line and observe the tooltip's text.\n6. Select **page-cors-subdomain-a.txt** and observe the information presented on the panel located on the right of the page.\n7. Select the **Console** tab and then **Errors** and observe the origin and destination domains on the **CORS** error line.\n\nGo to [RTM](https://manager.azion.com/) and proceed as follows:\n\n1. Select **Products menu** > **Edge Application**.\n2. Select the *domain A (a.domain)* application and navigate to the **Rules Engine** tab.\n3. Create a new rule by clicking the **New Rule** button and selecting **Response Phase**.\n4. Name your rule.\n5. In the **Criteria** section, fill in the fields as follows:\n    *If `${http_origin}` is equal `http://b-domain.com`* (without the trailing slash `/`)\n6. In the **Behaviors** section, select the **Add Response Header** behavior.\n7. As an argument, add `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: ${http_origin}`.\n\nNext, go to the HTML page and type the following code:\n\n```html\n#1 page-cors-subdomain-a.html\n<h2>Using the XMLHttpRequest Object</h2>\n\n<div id=\"demo\">\n<button type=\"button\" onclick=\"loadXMLDoc()\">Test CORS on click</button>\n</div>\n\n<script>\nfunction loadXMLDoc() {\n  var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();\n  xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {\n\tif (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {\n  \tdocument.getElementById(\"demo\").innerHTML =\n  \tthis.responseText;\n\t}\n  };\n  xhttp.open(\"GET\", \"http://a.domain.com/page-cors-subdomain-a.txt\", true);\n  xhttp.send();\n}\n</script>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n#2 page-cors-subdomain-a.txt\nYou clicked!\nI belong to the domain a.\nDomain b shall call me.\n```\n\nLastly, to validate the error was corrected, proceed as follows:\n\n1. On **Google Chrome**, select **View** > **Developer** > **Developer tools**.\n2. Select the **Network** tab.\n3. Click the first line **page-cors-subdomain.a.html** and observe the information presented on the panel located on the right of the page.\n4. Click **Test CORS on click** and find the following message:\n    `You clicked! I belong to the domain a. Domain b shall call me.`\n5. Select the **Console** tab > **Errors** and check if there are no errors.\n\nThe **CORS** policy is now working correctly.\n\n---\n\n## Trademarks\n\n[Chrome browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/) is a registered trademark of Google LLC in the United States and/or other countries.\n",

Log in to your Grafana account.\n2. Go to the [GraphQL Data Source page](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/fifemon-graphql-datasource/).\n3. On the top menu, select the **Installation** tab.\n4. On the **For** field, select the Grafana instance you want to install the plugin on.\n5. Click the **Install plugin** button.\n\nFor more information, see Grafana's documentation on [plugin installation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/v8.4/plugins/installation/).\n\nYou can also use [CLI to install a plugin](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/v8.4/administration/cli/#plugins-commands).\n\nIf you access your instance directly through its link, go directly to the steps related to access on the left menu. If you've created an account on Grafana's website, go to the **My Account** environment and follow the next steps:\n\n1. On the **Overview** page of your **Grafana Cloud Portal**, on the second section, you'll see the name of your stack.\n2. On the **Grafana** card, click **Launch**.\n\nYour stack opens on another page.\n\n1. On the left-side menu, on the **Connections** dropdown menu, select **Add new connection**.\n2. On the **Search** box, type `GraphQL Data Source`; it'll appear under **Data sources**.\n3. Select the `GraphQL Data Source` card.\n4. Click the **Create a GraphQL Data Source data source** button. A new page opens to configure your data source.\n\n---\n\n## Configuring the data source\n\nWith the GraphQL Data Source page opened on Grafana Cloud, on the **Settings** tab:\n\n1. On **Name**, give a descriptive name to your data source.\n2. Under **HTTP**:\n    - On **URL**, add either `https://api.azionapi.net/metrics/graphql` or `https://api.azionapi.net/events/graphql`.\n    - On **Custom HTTP Headers**, click **+ Add header** *two times*.\n    - On the first **Header**, on the first field, add **Authorization**, and on the second field add your RTM personal token. It looks similar to: `Token azionfkr40c7rp75d7df21e18d5c19el8f01`\n    - On the second **Header**, on the first field, add **Content-Type**, and on the second field add `application/json`.\n\n3. Click **Save & test**. Grafana will run a quick test to see if your authentication is correct.\n\n---\n\n## Creating a dashboard\n\n1. On the left-side menu, click on **Dashboards**. The dashboard page opens.\n2. Next to the search bar, click **New** > **New Dashboard**.\n3. On the panel, select **+ Add visualization**.\n4. From the data source list, select **GraphQL Data Source**.\n5. On the query box, add the Azion GraphQL API query you want to use.\n\nYou can customize your dashboard using the right-side panel. You can change the type of chart from time series to bar chart, for example, the legends of the chart, or even the graph style. Grafana also has other features such as annotations.\n\nSee the [Data Transferred dashboard on Grafana JSON example](/en/documentation/products/real-time-metrics/data-transferred-dash/) for a ready-to-use dashboard.\n\n---\n\n### Trademarks\n\n[Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/products/cloud/) is a trademark of Grafana Labs.

It queries data from [Real-Time Metrics](/en/documentation/products/real-time-metrics/), which uses the [GraphQL APIs](/en/documentation/products/graphql-api-overview).\n\nWith the data source plugin, you can customize your own dashboard to visualize the data you need.\n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n\nTo use the Azion data source plugin, you need:\n\n- A [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/) account on Azion.\n- A [personal token](/en/documentation/products/accounts/personal-tokens/) created to authenticate your account.\n- One or more [edge applications](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/) created on your account.\n- [Real-Time Metrics](/en/documentation/products/real-time-metrics/) activated on your account.\n- [Access to Grafana](https://grafana.com/).\n\n---\n\n## Installing the plugin on Grafana\n\nCurrently, to use the Azion data source plugin, you must install it locally and enable your account to use unsigned plugins. See the documentation on [the plugin's GitHub repository](https://github.com/aziontech/grafana-plugin#install-plugin-on-local-grafana) for a step-by-step on how to install it.\n\n---\n\n## Customizing a dashboard on Grafana\n\nAfter installing a Grafana instance locally on your machine and authorizing the Azion plugin, open it.\n\nFollow the next steps:\n\n1. On the left-side menu, click on **Dashboards**. The dashboard page opens.\n2. Next to the search bar, click **New** > **New Dashboard**.\n3. On the **Add panel** card, select **Add a new panel**.\n4. On the second section of the page, below the preview, on **Data source** dropdown menu, select **Azion**.\n5. On the code box, add the query you want to use.\n    - See the [GraphQL API guides](/en/documentation/products/graphql-api-overview) for a few examples of queries.\n\nThe five fields below can be used to complete your setup depending on what type of visualization you're using and what you want to see on your graphs:\n\n- **Data path**: insert the [data set you want to use](/en/documentation/products/graphql-api-features/#queries-datasets).\n- **Time path**: inform a timestamp. The field is dot-delimited.\n- **Time format**: inform a time format in [moment.js format](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/string/).\n- **Group by**: use the field you want to use to group your data aggregation.\n- **Alias by**: use to change the value and name of a field shown in the legend.\n\n6. On the right side of the page, on the **Visualization** list, select the visualization type you want to use. Example: **Time series**.\n7. On the upper-right corner, click **Save** to apply your configurations.\n\n---\n\n## Best practices\n\n- To use a time series graph, you must inform a timestamp on the **Time path** field. It must be used in ISO8601 format or a configurable custom format.\n- To aggregate data into multiple data points, you must use the **Group by** field. To use a time series graph, you must use this field.\n- Nested objects are flattened with underscores.\n- While using Grafana variables, replace them directly in the query's field.\n- To configure or change a name of a field shown in the legend, use the **Alias by** field: substitute `$field_<field.name>` with the values for the field; substitute `$fieldName` with a name for the field.\n- [Use annotations](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/build-dashboards/annotate-visualizations/) to mark points on a graph.\n- Use the dashboard's [time range](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/use-dashboards/#time-units-and-relative-ranges) to explore and analyze your data.\n\n---\n\n## Read more on Grafana\n\n- [Create and use dashboards](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/)\n- [Grafana dashboard best practices](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/build-dashboards/best-practices/)\n- [Add and manage variables](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/variables/)\n- [Configuring time series in ISO8601](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/string/)\n- [Configuring time series in custom format](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/string-format/)\n- [Visualizations](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/panels-visualizations/visualizations/)\n- [Configuring a legend](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/panels-visualizations/visualizations/configure-legend/)\n- [Configuring value mappings](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/panels-visualizations/configure-value-mappings/)\n\n---\n\n### Trademarks\n\n[Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/products/cloud/) is a trademark of Grafana Labs.

It queries data from [Real-Time Metrics](/en/documentation/products/real-time-metrics/), which uses the [GraphQL APIs](/en/documentation/products/graphql-api-overview).\n\nWith the data source plugin, you can use the pre-built Edge Application Data Transferred dashboard to view your data with minimum configuration effort.\n\n---\n\n## Requirements\n\nTo use the Azion data source, you need:\n\n- A [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/) account on Azion.\n- A [personal token](/en/documentation/products/accounts/personal-tokens/) created to authenticate your account.\n- One or more [edge applications](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/) created on your account.\n- [Real-Time Metrics](/en/documentation/products/real-time-metrics/) activated on your account.\n- [Access to Grafana](https://grafana.com/).\n\n---\n\n## Installing the plugin on Grafana\n\nCurrently, to use the Azion data source plugin, you must install it locally and enable your account to use unsigned plugins. See the documentation on [the plugin's GitHub repository](https://github.com/aziontech/grafana-plugin#install-plugin-on-local-grafana) for a step-by-step on how to install it.\n\n---\n\n## Using the pre-built dashboard on Grafana\n\nAfter installing a Grafana instance locally on your machine and authorizing the Azion plugin, open it.\n\nFollow the next steps:\n\n1. On the left-side menu, on the **Administration** dropdown menu, select **Plugins**.\n2. On the **Search** box, type `Azion`.\n3. Select the `Azion` card.\n4. Click the **Create an Azion data source** button.\n\nA new page opens to configure your data source.\n\nOn the **Settings** tab:\n\n1. On **Name**, give a descriptive name to your data source.\n2. On **Personal Token**, add the token you've created on the [Personal Tokens page on RTM](/en/documentation/products/accounts/personal-tokens/).\n3. Click **Save & test**. Grafana will run a quick test to see if your authentication is correct.\n\nOn the **Dashboards** tab:\n\n1. Select the **Data Transferred** dashboard option.\n2. Click the **Import** button.\n\nThe pre-built dashboard is imported to your account. To access it:\n\n1. On the left-side menu, click **Dashboards**.\n2. Select the **Data Transferred** dashboard option from the list under **General**.\n\nYou'll automatically be able to view and analyze the Edge Application Data Transferred data from Real-Time Metrics.

    "body": "\nAggregated data can also be considered as structured data that have been clustered. They go through modifications to allow a better analytic processing seeking a segmented analysis.\n\nTo query the available aggregated data in the [GraphQL API](/en/documentation/products/graphql-api-overview), follow the steps described on [How to query GraphQL requests on Postman](/en/documentation/products/guides/query-graphql-postman/) using the `https://api.azionapi.net/metrics/graphql` URL.\n\nThen, on Postman’s GraphQL request code box, add the following **Aggregated Query**, modifying the `tsRange` to fit the time interval you want:\n\n```graphql\nquery HttpQuery {\n  httpMetrics(\n    limit: 10,\n    filter: {\n      tsRange: {begin:\"2022-03-21T10:10:10\", end:\"2022-06-23T10:10:10\"}\n    }\n    aggregate: {sum: bytesSent}\n    groupBy: [ts]\n    orderBy: [ts_ASC]\n  )\n  {\n    ts\n    sum\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOn the example above, you'll query for an aggregated table of the **HTTP** dataset. Furthermore, the **sum** operator was used to request the aggregated data with information regarding the **bytesSent** field in a set range of time periods, informed through the **tsRange** field.\n\nLastly, the presented data were grouped and ordered through the **ts** (timestamp) field.\n\nTo query aggregated data, it's *mandatory* to inform:\n\n- A time range interval for queries, using either **tsRange** or **tsGt** + **tsLt**.\n- The fields whose information you want to group, using **groupBy**.\n- Which consulted data should be exhibited. On the presented example, the **ts** and **sum** fields were used, in which **sum** represents the response of the **bytesSent** aggregation.\n\nTo aggregate information made available through the **GraphQL API** as in the presented example, there are a few options that you must inform through the **aggregate** field in your query. They are:\n\n- **Count**: determines the total value of records meeting a specific condition.\n- **Sum**: returns the sum of the entry values of a column or expression.\n- **Max**: returns the maximum value of a determined field of a table according to the established selection criteria.\n- **Min**: returns the minimum value of a determined field of a table according to the established selection criteria.\n- **Avg**: calculates the arithmetic mean of a set of values in a specific field being consulted.\n- **Rate**: used for the imagesProcessed dataset. Obtains the rate of images being processed by second while using Image Processor.\n\n> You can run a request with one of each of the available options: **count**, **sum**, **max**, **min**, **avg**, and **rate**, as long as each option is only used *once* and each operator aggregates only *one* dataset field at a time. See the following example:\n\n```graphql\naggregate: {\n    count: rows, \n    sum: bytesSent, \n    avg: requestTime, \n    max: requestLength,\n    min: missedData,\n    rate: requestTime\n}\n```\n\n---\n\nSend your request. You’ll receive a response similar to this:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"data\": {\n       \"httpMetrics\": [\n           {\n               \"ts\": \"2022-06-09T21:33:13\",\n               \"sum\": 1471.0\n           },\n           {\n               \"ts\": \"2022-06-09T21:33:14\",\n               \"sum\": 1471.0\n           },\n           {\n               \"ts\": \"2022-06-09T21:33:15\",\n               \"sum\": 1471.0\n           }\n       ]\n   }\n}\n```\n\nThe GraphQL API returned the aggregated data with the **sum** operator for the **bytesSent** field, according to the query informed in the request.\n\nFor more information on aggregating data with the GraphQL API, visit the [datasets documentation page](/en/documentation/products/graphql-api-features/#queries-datasets).\n",

To use Postman, you need to go through two steps: create a personal token and run your request on Postman. See the next sections and follow the presented steps.\n\n---\n\n## Creating a personal token\n\nBefore running your requests with the **GraphQL API**, you first need to create a personal token on Azion to validate your access.\n\n1. On [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/), on the upper-right corner, select **Account menu** > **Personal Tokens**.\n2. Fill the fields to configure the personal token and click the **Create Token** button.\n3. Copy and save your token in a safe location to use it in the next section.\n\n> See the [Personal Tokens documentation](/en/documentation/products/accounts/personal-tokens/) for more information on how to create one.\n\nAs an alternative, you can create a short-duration token through the [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/).\n\n---\n\n## Querying on Postman\n\nAfter creating your personal token, [go to Postman](https://www.postman.com/) and follow the next steps:\n\n1. On the header, click the **+** button to create a new request.\n2. On the **Headers** tab, click on **Bulk Edit** and add the following code, replacing [TOKEN VALUE] with the personal token value you created:\n\n```json\nAuthorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]\n```\n\nRemain on **Postman** and create the request's body:\n\n1. Select the **Body** tab.\n2. On the upper-left corner, click the **GET** option to open a dropdown menu.\n3. Select the **POST** option.\n4. On the **Enter URL or paste text** field, add the URL being queried: `https://api.azionapi.net/metrics/graphql` or `https://api.azionapi.net/events/graphql`\n5. On the options row with radio buttons, select the **GraphQL** option.\n6. On the code box, add the query you want to use. For example:\n\n```graphql\nquery HttpQuery {\n  httpMetrics(\n    limit: 10,\n    filter: {\n      tsRange: {begin:\"2022-03-21T10:10:10\", end:\"2022-06-23T10:10:10\"}\n    }\n    aggregate: {sum: bytesSent}\n    groupBy: [ts]\n    orderBy: [ts_ASC]\n  )\n  {\n    ts\n    sum\n  }\n}\n```\n\n7. Click the **Send** button on the upper-right corner.\n\nYou'll receive a response with the requested data, similar to this:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"data\": {\n       \"httpMetrics\": [\n           {\n               \"ts\": \"2022-06-09T21:33:13\",\n               \"sum\": 1471.0\n           },\n           {\n               \"ts\": \"2022-06-09T21:33:14\",\n               \"sum\": 1471.0\n           },\n           {\n               \"ts\": \"2022-06-09T21:33:15\",\n               \"sum\": 1471.0\n           }\n       ]\n   }\n}\n```\n\nYou can find queries examples on the [GitHub azion-queries repository](https://github.com/aziontech/azion-queries).\n",

    "body": "\nGzip is the standard method for lossless file compression for web applications. By using the Deflate algorithm to reduce the size of files before they are sent to browsers, gzip compression ensures faster page rendering and downloads for your users.\n\n> See the [official gzip website](https://www.gzip.org/) for useful links and information.\n\nWhen you enable gzip compression for Azion **Edge Application**, the following events take place during a request for content from your application:\n\n1. At the edge node, Azion verifies the cache for a compressed version of the file.\n2. If the file's already compressed, it's delivered to the browser. If it isn't, Azion compresses the file, returns it to the browser, and adds it to the cache.\n3. The browser interprets and decompresses the file.\n\n---\n\n## Using Rules Engine to enable gzip compression\n\nYou can enable gzip compression for any edge application using the [Rules Engine for Edge Application](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/rules-engine/).\n\n**To enable gzip compression for your application, follow these steps:**\n\n1. [Access Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).\n2. Select **Products menu** > **Edge Application**.\n3. Click on the application you want to configure or [build a new one](/en/documentation/products/getting-started/#build-edge-app).\n4. In the **Rules Engine** tab, click the **Add Rule** button and select either **Response Phase** or **Request Phase**.\n5. In the **Criteria** section, define the desired criteria for activation of the behavior.\n\n    > To apply gzip compression for your entire application, you can set a default criteria as follows:\n    >\n    > If `${uri}` starts with `/`\n\n6. In the **Behavior** section, select the **Enable gzip** behavior.\n7. Click the **Save** button.\n\nTo verify whether gzip compression has been applied, access your application and inspect the page. The `Content-Encoding` request header should contain the value `gzip`.\n\n---\n\n## Support for gzip compression\n\nAzion servers support gzip compression for some file extensions, which are identified via their MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) type.\n\n### About MIME types\n\nWhenever a page loads within a web browser, a web server sends information regarding the contents and data of the page to the browser. Such details are stored in request headers and they are passed to the browser so that it can load and interpret the page.\n\nThe `Content-Type` header is responsible for processing page contents through the MIME type. MIME types inform the types of documents, files, or byte arrays within the web application, as well as how they should be processed.\n\nMIME types consist of a type and subtype combined by a `/` symbol in between each other. The type represents the category of that data file; for instance, `text` or `image`. The subtype stands for the exact data type represented by the MIME type. For instance, the MIME type `image` could carry a subtype `jpeg` or `png`.\n\nTherefore, when your browser runs into an `<img>` HTML tag, it sends out a request to the server. If this image is a .png, the server will return the header and MIME type: `Content-Type: image/png`.\n\n> The entity responsible for all official MIME types is the [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml).\n\nFiles that have undergone gzip compression should retain their original MIME type on the request header, since the browser is responsible for decompressing the file upon the end of the request.\n\n### List of supported MIME types for gzip compression\n\n| MIME Type                     | Extension

    "body": "\nAzion's Edge Computing platform has serverless functions that enable Edge Websites to be created and all processing done directly on our Edge Nodes, without having to access any origin infrastructure. \n\nWith the Edge Function, Hello World, you can create error or status pages that you can use to monitor and report on the status of a particular service, in real time, directly on the Edge, so that availability is high and latency low.\n\nCombined with Azion's Data Streaming service, the client can send records of the accesses made to the Edge Website to their SIEM (_Security information and Event Management_), Big Data or log servers, and carry out analysis of the data collected.\n\nSome other advantages of using the Edge Function, Hello World:\n\n* Gives the client flexibility when developing applications;\n* Edge Websites are processed through a distributed Edge Nodes infrastructure; and\n* The option to run business rules on the Edge.\n\n## How it works\n\nIt is very simple to use: Just install a Hello World function within your Edge Application and configure the desired response through the parameters of the function (Args). When a request reaches the Edge, the validation criteria are assessed, and, if all requirements are met, the function will be run.\n\nNext, in order to show how an Edge Website in Azion works, we have an example where you want to display a status page with a service temporarily unavailable notice ('www.myapplication.com/api_service', for example), created by using the Hello World Edge Function. \n\n## Configuring the Hello World function\n\nEdge Function Hello World is available from the function library of Azion's Edge Computing platform and can be accessed through Real-Time Manager (RTM), from the _Libraries_ menu.\n\nTo run the function, it must be installed in the relevant **Edge Application** and its activation criteria and behaviors must be defined within the **Rules Engine**.\n\n## Creating an Instance\n\n**Path:** Real-Time Manager `>` Edge Computing `>` Edge Applications `>` Sua Edge Application (Your Edge Application) `>` Functions.\n\nFrom the RTM, go to the Edge Application that will run your function and, within the Functions tab, add a new function and give it a distinctive name (MyHelloWorld, to illustrate our example).\n\n**Parameters:** it is necessary to select which function to use for your instance; in this case, choose the Hello World option, in the \"Edge Function\" field. Note that the function code that appears in the Code field, is just for information. On the Args tab, enter the HTTP code and the desired response message - see example below - and save the function. \n``` json\n{\n    \"param\":{\n        \"http_status\": 503,\n        \"body\": \"We are working hard to serve you better!\"\n    }\n}\n```\nExample of the configuration of JSON Args parameters\n\n## Defining the Execution criteria (Rules Engine)\n\n**Path:** Real-Time Manager `>` Edge Computing `>` Edge Applications `>` Sua Edge Application (Your Edge Application) `>` Rules Engine.\n\nThe rules (as defined in the Rules Engine) determine the set of conditions that need to be met for Behaviors to be executed. You can either use the Default Rule or create a new rule after setting the validation parameters and the behaviors that the Edge Application will execute.\n\n**Defining validation Criteria:** choose the variables, comparison operators and strings to create your business rule, as in the following example:\n\n* **If**: `${uri}` **starts with** `/api_service`\n(In order: logical operator, variable, comparison operator, string)\n\nHere, the rule is executed if the URL accessed starts with the string “/api_service”.\n\n**Defining Behaviors:** add the behaviors you want to be carried out when the rule's conditions are met. For Example:\n\n* **Then**: ***Run Function*** **MyHelloWorld**\n(In order: logical operator, action, function)\n\nIn this example, if the conditions defined in the rules are satisfied, then the function MyHelloWorld will be run. Therefore, when the user accesses the URL \"www.myapplication.com/api_service\", the function will run, and the message will be displayed as set.\n\nFinally, save your Edge Application and the new function will be ready. \n",

    "body": "\n**Rules Engine** is an **Edge Application** capability that allows you to create no-code solutions that follow the business rules of your edge application.\n\nWith Azion **Edge Application**'s reverse-proxy architecture, the rules you create will be executed between either the **Request phase**, which contains data that a client sends to an origin server, or **Response phase**, which contains data from the origin that is sent to the client.\n\nSee the official documentation on [Rules Engine](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/rules-engine/) for more information.\n\n---\n\n## Creating a request rule: Rewrite Request\n\nRules created in the **Request phase** will be executed before the request to the origin servers is completed. For instance, using the **Rewrite Request** behavior, you can create a rule to deliver content to a user from a specific URI without requiring that they use the exact path value from the origin in the request.\n\nFor the purposes of this guide, assume that your goal is to deliver the contents of the page `/content/page.html` when a client makes a request for `https://www.domain.com/page`. To create a rule that will rewrite this request:\n\n1. Access [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).\n2. On the upper-left corner of the page, go to **Products menu** > **Edge Application**.\n3. Select the edge application for which you want to create the rule.\n4. In the **Main Settings** tab, enable the **Application Acceleration** module.\n5. Select the **Rules Engine** tab.\n6. Click the **Add Rule** button.\n7. On the dropdown menu, select **Request Phase**.\n8. Give your rule a name and, if necessary, a description.\n9. In the **Criteria** section, configure your criteria as follows:\n\n    If `${uri}` *is equal to* `/page`\n    > This criteria will identify the URL of the request by the URI trailing slash `/`.\n\n10. In the **Behaviors** section, add the behavior you want your application to execute. In this case, **Rewrite Request**.\n11. The behavior selected takes an argument; to redirect the request to the page:\n\n   `${uri}content/page.html`\n   > This argument concatenates the `${uri}` variable, whose value is `/`, to the page's path.\n\n12. Click the **Save** button to save your rule.\n\nNow, when a request is made to the URL `https://www.domain.com/page`, users should see the contents from the `/content/page.html` page without having to specify the entire address in their browser.\n\n---\n\n## Creating a response rule: Filter Response Header\n\nRules created in the **Response phase** will be executed before the response is delivered to the client. For example, you can create a rule that'll remove an HTTP header from the response using the **Filter Response Header** behavior.\n\nThe `Server` header stores information about the server that generated the response. By removing this header, clients won't receive information about the infrastructure of your application, enhancing your security by reducing the information available to potential attackers.\n\n> **Note**: exercise caution when removing any headers from your edge application and ensure that this action doesn't interfere in any applicable standards and guidelines.\n\nTo filter the `Server` header from the response:\n\n1.

From  [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/), go to **Edge Firewall** and click **Add Rule set**;\n\n4. Give your Edge Firewall a name, select the *Domain*, enable the *Network Layer Protection* and *Web Application Firewall* flags;\n\n5. Click **Save** to save your settings; \n\n6. Click the **Rules Engine** tab (which will be displayed right after you save the previous configuration) and then click **New Rule**;\n\n7. In **Criteria**, select **Request URI** and fill in the same settings that you copied from *Edge Application/Rules Engine* (item 2), that is the same *logical operator* and/or the same *regular expression*;\n\n8. In **Behavior**, select *Set WAF Rule Set*, select the Rule Set you want, and choose *Learning* or *Blocking* mode.\n\n**Note:** during migration both settings work at the same time. After 5 minutes, you can disable *Edge Firewall* and *Web Application Firewall* flags in *Edge Application>Rules Engine*, as they will already be saved as rules in **Edge Firewall**.\n",

    "body": "\nIn this document, we will indicate the features used in the deprecated versions, showing how to bring them to the latest version. To learn more about new features, and how to use them, see the [product page](https://www.azion.com/pt-br/produtos/edge-firewall/) and [documentation](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/).\n\nRule Sets deprecated from Edge Firewall show the following banner: `This Edge Firewall rule set is deprecated. Please upgrade to the new version.`\n\n[![banner](/assets/docs/images/update-edge-firewall/banner.jpg)](/assets/docs/images/update-edge-firewall/banner.jpg)\n\n---\n\n## What has changed?\n\nUntil now, the use of a Rule Set from Edge Firewall or WAF was through activation of Edge Firewall and Web Application Firewall modules in the Main Settings tab of each Edge Application and subsequent use of Behaviors **Set Edge Firewall Rule Set** and **Set WAF Rule Set** in the Edge Application Rules Engine.\n\nEdge Firewall has become an independent product that concentrates all security features: **DDoS Protection**,  **Network Layer Protection**, **Web Application Firewall**, and **Edge Functions**.\n\n> Before updating your version of the **Edge Firewall** it's necessary to have the latest version of the **Edge Application** product.\n\n---\n\n## Assigning your Rule Sets to the latest version of Edge Firewall\n\nTo use the latest Azion Edge Firewall, follow the steps below, each section describes how each feature works on the new modules, Network Lists, and Rules Engine.\n\n### Step 1 - Creating new rule sets in Edge Firewall\n\nFirst, you need to create a Rule Set and new rules based on pre-existing rules. Through the process, we will explain how each feature works on the latest version:\n\n#### Create Edge Firewall Rule Set:\n\n1. Log into [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/), go to the Products menu in the upper left corner, under **SECURE** select **Edge Firewall**. You can also click directly on Edge Firewall on the Getting started page.\n2. Add an **Edge Firewall** by clicking **Add a Rule Set** or edit an already created one.\n3. Follow the steps below according to the functionality:\n\n#### Referrer Blocking\n\n[![referer-blocking](/assets/docs/images/update-edge-firewall/referer-blocking.jpg)](/assets/docs/images/update-edge-firewall/referer-blocking.jpg)\n\nIf you used **Referer Block** in your deprecated rule set, in the new rule set:\n\n1. Enable the module **Web Application Firewall**.\n2. Then, follow the tab **Rules Engine** in **Criteria**, and select **Header Referer**.\n3. Add the domain of the old Rule Set with the condition **Header Referer**, using the comparator **does not match**.\n4. For each domain in **Accepted Domains** of the old Rule Set, add an **AND** rule by repeating step 3.\n5. In **Behavior**, select the Behavior **Deny 403**.\n\n#### Geo-Blocking\n\n[![geo-blocking](/assets/docs/images/update-edge-firewall/geo-blocking.jpg)](/assets/docs/images/update-edge-firewall/geo-blocking.jpg)\n\nIf you used **Geo-Blocking** in your deprecated rule set, in the new rule set:\n\n1. Access the [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/) and enter the **Libraries** > **Network Lists** menu.\n2. Add or edit a **Network List**.\n3. In the **Type** option, select **Countries**.\n4. Copy the list of countries from the deprecated rule set to **Network Lists**.\n5. In the **Edge Firewall**, enable the **Network Layer Protection** module.\n6. On the **Rules Engine** tab, create a new **Rule** and select **Criteria: Network**.\n7. Choose a logical operator where **Match** means Blacklist and **Does not Match** means Whitelist.\n8. Then, select the **Country** type of **Network List** created in steps 3 and 4.\n9. In **Behavior**, select the Behavior **Deny 403**.\n\n#### Secure Token\n\n[![secure-token](/assets/docs/images/update-edge-firewall/secure-token.jpg)](/assets/docs/images/update-edge-firewall/secure-token.jpg)\n\nIf you used **Secure Token** in your deprecated rule set, in the new rule set:\n\n1. Enable the module **Edge Functions**.\n2. In the **Functions** tab, select **Add function** to instantiate a **Secure Token** Edge Function.\n3. Fill in the information and use the editor to customize Function **Args** to define the secret that composes the hash.\n4. On the **Rules Engine** tab, define a **Criteria** that will be used on **Edge Function**.\n5. In **Behavior** select **Run Function**, then select **Secure Token** function, created in steps 2 and 4.\n\n#### IP Blocking\n\n[![ip-blocking](/assets/docs/images/update-edge-firewall/ip-blocking.jpg)](/assets/docs/images/update-edge-firewall/ip-blocking.jpg)\n\nIf you used **IP Blocking** in your deprecated rule set, in the new rule set:\n\n1. Access the [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/) and enter the **Libraries** > **Network Lists** menu.\n2. Add or edit a **Network List**.\n3. In the **Type** option, select **IP/CIDR**.\n4. Copy the list of IP\\`s from the deprecated rule set to **Network Lists**.\n5. In the **Edge Firewall**, enable the **Network Layer Protection** module.\n6. On the **Rules Engine** tab, create a new **Rule** and select **Criteria: Network**.\n7. Choose a logical operator where **Match** means Blacklist and **Does not Match** means Whitelist.\n8. Then, select the **IP/CIDR** type of **Network List** created in steps 3 and 4.\n9. In **Behavior**, select the Behavior **Deny 403**.\n\n#### Rate Limiting\n\n[![rate-limiting](/assets/docs/images/update-edge-firewall/rate-limiting.jpg)](/assets/docs/images/update-edge-firewall/rate-limiting.jpg)\n\nIf you used **Rate Limiting** in your deprecated rule set, in the new rule set:\n\n1. Select the **Rules Engine** tab.\n2. Then, define the **Criteria** for your Rule Set.\n3. In **Behavior**, select **Set Rate Limit**.\n4. Set the number of requests per second in the **Average Rate Limit**.\n5. Set to **Client IP** Address or **Global**.\n6. After, set the **Maximum burst size**.\n\n#### Association of Domains to the new Rule Set\n\nAfter making the settings associate one or more domains to the new **Rule Set**:\n\n1. Edit the new **Rule Set** of the **Edge Firewall**.\n2. In the **Domains** section, select domains that will be associated with the **Rule Set** in Main Settings.\n3. **Save** to apply the configuration.\n\n#### WAF Rule Set Association\n\nAfter making the settings associate your **WAF Rule Set** to the new Rule Set. You can use the WAF Rule Sets the same way. However, they pass from the **Edge Application** to the **Edge Firewall** Rules Engine:\n\n1. Edit the new **Rule Set** of the **Edge Firewall**.\n2. Enable the module **Web Application Firewall**.\n3. On the **Rules Engine** tab, add or edit a Rule.\n4. Set the **Criteria** to condition the use of the **WAF Rule Set**.\n5. In **Behavior** select **Set WAF Rule Set** and choose a WAF Rule Set.\n6. **Save** to apply the settings.\n\n### Step 2 - Removing the Edge Firewall rules in the Edge Application\n\nAfter creating and applying the Rule Sets for the latest version of Edge Firewall for your domain, remove the Rules in Edge Application:\n\n1. Log into [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/), go to the **Products** menu in the upper left corner and under **BUILD** select **Edge Applications**.\n2. Edit an **Edge Application** with the **Edge Firewall** configuration.\n3. On the **Rules Engine** tab, identify the **Behaviors Set Edge Firewall** with **Rule Sets** or **Set WAF Rule Set**.\n4. Remove the **Behavior** from **Edge Application**.\n5. Next, confirm the deletion by clicking **Delete** and your rule will be removed.\n",

    "body": "\nWeb applications that use the HTTPS protocol require a [Digital Certificate](/en/documentation/products/guides/massive-redirect/). When you redirect your traffic to Azion, you have the option to generate a *Let's Encrypt*™ certificate, which is a free and secure way to encrypt data for your edge application. Azion automates the issuance, renewal, and deactivation of this TLS certificate through an internal certificate management solution.\n\n---\n\n## Before you begin\n\nAzion generates Let's Encrypt certificates for domains and subdomains registered in the Domain Name System (DNS). Domains can be acquired and registered into DNS zones through a third-party DNS provider, such as [GoDaddy](http://www.godaddy.com/) or [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/get-a-domain/).\n\nFor the purposes of this guide, assume that the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) that you want to generate a Let's Encrypt certificate for is a CNAME record `www.yourdomain.org` under a `yourdomain.org` DNS zone.\n\n---\n\n## Generating a Let's Encrypt certificate\n\nYou may choose to generate a Let’s Encrypt certificate for domain records hosted in [Intelligent DNS](/en/documentation/products/intelligent-dns/) or in the external DNS provider of your top-level domain.\n\nTo that end, you'll have to prepare your DNS server and register records for Azion to be able to create and manage your Let's Encrypt certificate.\n\n### Option 1: Preparing DNS entry on Azion Intelligent DNS\n\nAzion allows you to host DNS zones by redirecting the DNS resolution of a domain to **Intelligent DNS**. When using Intelligent DNS, all configurations needed are made through Azion **Real-Time Manager**.\n\nTo create a DNS zone for a domain entry `www.yourdomain.org` in **Intelligent DNS**:\n\n1. Access [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com).\n2. On the upper-left corner of the page, click the three horizontal lines to open the **Products menu**.\n3. Under the section **SECURE**, select **Intelligent DNS**.\n4. If you don't have an active zone, click the **Add Zone** button.\n5. Give your zone an easy-to-remember name.\n6. Indicate the FQDN as recorded in the DNS. Example: `yourdomain.org`.\n7. Click the **Save** button.\n\n> For more information on how to redirect your domain's authoritative DNS servers, see the [Intelligent DNS](/en/documentation/products/intelligent-dns/) documentation.\n\nOnce your DNS resolution has been successfully redirected and is hosted in Intelligent DNS, you can create a new *CNAME record* for the domain by following the steps:\n\n1. In the **Intelligent DNS** page in [RTM](https://manager.azion.com), select the desired zone.\n2. Navigate to the **Records** tab.\n3. Under **Name**, create a hostname or subdomain. Example: `www`.\n4. Under **Type**, select **CNAME - Canonical name**.\n5. Under **Value**, enter the Azion-provided domain address in FQDN format. Example: `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`\n   - If you don't have a domain, skip to section [Creating a domain](#creating-a-domain) for more information.\n6. Set the **TTL** and **Policy** as desired.\n7. Click the **Save** button.\n\nIf the **CNAME** entry listed in your Azion domain has been created in your **Intelligent DNS** zone, Azion will automatically verify the domain authenticity and the Let's Encrypt certificate will become active. Go to the section [Checking the status of Let's Encrypt certificates](#checking-the-status-of-lets-encrypt-certificates) for more information on certificate statuses.\n\n### Option 2: Preparing DNS entry with an external DNS provider\n\nIf you have a domain registered in an external DNS zone, Azion will verify the domain authenticity in an external DNS provider by completing Let's Encrypt method called [DNS-01 ACME client challenge](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#dns-01-challenge) to issue the certificate.\n\n> If you already have a zone in **Intelligent DNS**, the DNS-01 challenge will be completed automatically.\n\nTo allow the DNS-01 challenge to occur:\n\n1. Access your DNS provider's website.\n2. Navigate to the DNS management area.\n3. Create a **CNAME record** for each domain you want to use the certificate. This must be the same CNAME you'll add to the **CNAME** field when creating your Azion domain later. Example: `www.yourdomain.org`\n4. Add a new record to your domain as follows:\n\n| Name | Value | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `_acme-challenge.<your domain>` <br /><br />For example:<br /> `_acme-challenge.www.yourdomain.org` | `<your domain>.letsencrypt.azion.com` <br /><br />Example:<br /> `www.yourdomain.org.letsencrypt.azion.com` | CNAME |\n\n1. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for every CNAME you intend to add to your **Domain**.\n2. Save your settings.\n\nNow that the challenge can take place, the next step is to create a domain with Azion.\n\n---\n\n## Creating a domain\n\n> To create an Azion **Domain**, you must have an edge application. If you haven't created an edge application yet, follow the [Getting started](/en/documentation/products/getting-started/) guide.\n\nOnce you have an edge application, you need to [create a domain](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/domains/) and list the CNAMEs that you want to secure with the Let's Encrypt certificate. To do so, follow these steps:\n\n1. Access [RTM](https://manager.azion.com).\n2. On the upper-left corner, select the three horizontal lines to open the **Products menu** > **Domains**.\n3. Click the **Add Domain** button.\n4. Name your domain. Example: `Domain`.\n5. Under **Edge Certificate**, select the option **Let's Encrypt**.\n6. Under **CNAME**, add the FQDN of the domain you created in the previous sections. Example: `www.yourdomain.org`\n7. Under **Edge Application**, select the application you created.\n8. Click the **Save** button.\n\n---\n\n## Checking the status of Let's Encrypt certificates\n\nYou can check the status of your Let's Encrypt TLS certificate by following these steps:\n\n1. In [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com), access the **Products menu**.\n2. Under **EDGE LIBRARIES**, select **Digital Certificates**.\n3. In your digital certificate list, you'll see a new entry in the format `Domain - Let's Encrypt <timestamp>`.\n\nThe status on the right of the list shows you whether the certificate has been issued. An **Active** certificate has been verified and issued successfully. A **Pending** status means the certificate is still undergoing checks in Azion's internal certificate manager.\n\n> **Note**: if the **Pending** status remains for over 48 hours, you must check if the CNAME records you listed in the section [Creating a domain](#creating-a-domain) are correct.\n\n---\n\n## Managing a Let's Encrypt certificate\n\nOnce the certificate undergoes DNS validation, it won't require manual renewal upon expiration, which occurs after *90 days*. Deactivation will occur if the certificate is deleted or if the associated domain is deleted from Azion.\n\n> **Warning**: to ensure that the certificate is renewed for domains hosted in external services, **don't delete the DNS challenge entry** you've created in the section [Option 2: Preparing DNS entry with an external DNS provider](#option-2-preparing-dns-entry-with-an-external-dns-provider).\n\n---\n\n## Pointing your traffic to Azion\n\nOnce you have an active Let's Encrypt certificate, you can point your traffic to Azion by associating your Azion-provided domain address `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net` to your domain's CNAME record. To do so:\n\n1. Access [RTM](https://manager.azion.com).\n2. On the upper-left corner of the page, go to **Products menu** > **Domains**.\n3. From the **Domains** list, copy the Azion-provided domain address that you want to associate to the external domain, which should be in the format `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`\n4. In another browser tab, access your DNS provider.\n5. Navigate to the DNS management area.\n6. Edit the domain CNAME record with the Let's Encrypt certificate as follows:\n\n| Name | Value | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `www.yourdomain.org` | `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net` | CNAME |\n\n7. Save your settings.\n\nNote that there might be a delay in propagation time when you access your application. If that's the case, you can [run the DIG command](/en/documentation/products/guides/run-the-dig-command/) in your terminal to check whether your domain points to the Azion address.\n",

Tests enable you to experiment with variations and how they work with your users, providing two options to access certain content or complete task.\n\n## Getting the solution \n\nTo use the A/B test solution provided through Azion Marketplace, follow these steps:\n\n1. Access [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/) and log in.\n    - If you don't have an account, [visit the creating an account documentation](/en/documentation/products/accounts/creating-account/)\n2. On the upper-left corner of the page, select **Products menu** > **Marketplace**.\n3. On the Marketplace's homepage, type \"*test*\" in the search box or browse through the cards below it to find the desired A/B Testing solution.\n4. Select the desired A/B Testing card to be redirected to the solution's page.\n5. On the **Subscribe for** section, at the bottom-right corner of the page, click the **Get It Now** button.\n\n> A successful message appears. Your solution is installed and ready to use.\n\n---\n\n## Using the solution\n\nOnce you’ve gotten your solution on **Marketplace**, it’ll be available at your edge functions list. To use the solution, you’ll have to create a new edge application.\n\nTo create an edge application you have three options:\n\n- By visiting the documentation on [getting started](/en/documentation/products/getting-started/). \n- Through **RTM**, on the upper-left corner of the page, select **Products menu** > **Edge Application** and follow the instructions.\n- Using an already existing edge application.\n\n---\n\n## Configuring the A/B Testing Edge Application\n\nOn the **Edge Application** listing page, locate the new A/B Testing edge application and select it.\n\nSome solutions may have prerequisites to function. The A/B Testing solution needs three other products to be enabled to run. To enable these products, follow the steps:\n\n1. Click the **Function** switch to enable functions module.\n2. Click the **Application Acceleration** switch to enable the Application Acceleration module.\n3. On the bottom-right corner, click the **Save** button.\n\n> A successful message appears informing that the edge application has been updated.\n\n---\n\n## Adding origins\n\nTo configure the JSON file, you'll have to register the origins (the websites) you want to redirect your solution. These origins will receive a unique ID called `Origin Key`.\n\nOn the homepage of the application, follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to the **Origins** tab.\n2. Click the **Add Origin** button.\n3. Give an easy-to-remember name to this origin.\n4. Select **Single Origin** for the type of origin.\n5. Select `${host}` for the **Host Header** option.\n6. You can pass an **Origin Path**, but this is optional.\n7. Choose the protocol you want to use: `HTTP`, `HTTPS`, or `preserve` to preserve the original protocol.\n8. Pass the URL you want to register for this origin.\n9. Click the **Save** button.\n\nAfter you save it, you'll be able to see the `Origin Key` generated by RTM for the origin you've registered. This will be used to fill the `originid` field on the Args box of the function.\n\n> **Note**: you must register at least two origins.\n\n---\n\n## Instantiating the A/B Testing Edge Application\n\nTo enable the A/B Testing function, follow these steps:\n1. On the top list, select the **Functions** tab.\n2. Click the **Add Function** button.\n3. On the edge function's name text box, give an easy-to-remember name.\n4. On the function dropdown menu, select the **A/B Testing [Global]** function.\n\nThis will load the function, showing a form with the source code of the solution and two tabs: **Code** and **Args**.\n\nIf you click the **Code** tab, you can navigate through the source code to become familiar with it, but without making changes. On the **Args** tab, you can change the configuration of your A/B Testing function. \n\nSelect the **Args** tab to open the form for the JSON **Args** where you can add the parameters to execute your application.\n\n> Note that the parameters have divisions of at least three sections: `params`, `a`, `b`.\n\nThe form will load the parameters as below:\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"param\": {\n\t\t\"cookie\": {\n\t\t\t\"name\": \"azion_abtest\",\n\t\t\t\"expiration\": \"Wed, 04 May 2011 10:16:00 GMT\",\n\t\t\t\"max_age\": 600,\n\t\t\t\"domain\": \"localhost\",\n\t\t\t\"path\": \"/\"\n\t\t},\n\t\t\"a\": {\n\t\t\t\"cookie_value\": \"A_TEST\",\n\t\t\t\"prob\": 0.5,\n\t\t\t\"addresses_list\": \"localhost:2006\",\n\t\t\t\"originid\": \"uuid1\",\n\t\t\t\"live_ingest\": false,\n\t\t\t\"protocol_policy\": \"http\",\n\t\t\t\"path\": \"\",\n\t\t\t\"cache_key\": \"test_a\",\n\t\t\t\"host\": \"localhost\"\n\t\t},\n\t\t\"b\": {\n\t\t\t\"cookie_value\": \"B_TEST\",\n\t\t\t\"prob\": 0.5,\n\t\t\t\"addresses_list\": \"localhost:2010\",\n\t\t\t\"originid\": \"uuid2\",\n\t\t\t\"live_ingest\": false,\n\t\t\t\"protocol_policy\": \"preserve\",\n\t\t\t\"path\": \"\",\n\t\t\t\"cache_key\": \"test_b\",\n\t\t\t\"host\": \"localhost\"\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n\n1. `name`: the name of the cookie you'll choose (choose a significant name that will be easy to remember).\n2. `expiration`: the expiration date of this cookie.\n3. `max_age`: the time (in seconds) for the lifespan of a cookie.\n4. `domain`: the domain where you're running the tests.\n5. `path`: the subdomain to the cookie (you can use `/` to set the subdomain to all the domains).\n\nOn the second section, called `a`, you can add the parameters to the first test:\n\n1. `cookie_value`: a value to identify the cookie for this test variation.\n2. `prob`: the probability to send this address to the user (this value should be between 0 and 1, with 0 being 0% of chance and 1 being 100% of chance).\n3. `adressess_list`: the address for the a test (for example: `www.mytest_ab_of_my_site.com:443`).\n4. `originid`: the identification ID for the origin (this will be automatically generated by RTM).\n5. `live_ingest`: it indicates if the origin is a live streaming (a Boolean value should be used here, `true` or `false`).\n6. `protocol_policy`: you can force HTTP or HTTPS, or even keep the default value by passing the preserve value.\n7. `path`: it indicates the subdomain of the cookie (you can leave it blank, \"\", to indicate that this is valid for all domains).\n8. `cache_key`: here you have to give a name to identify the cache, it should be unique and you can't repeat it elsewhere.\n9. `host`: the name of the host that the requisition sends.\n\n---\n\n## Configuring the Rules Engine\n\nOn the **Rules Engine** tab, you'll pass the *criteria* and *behavior* to run the solution.\n\n1. Select the **Rules Engine** tab.\n2. Click the **Default Rule**.\n    - Note that you can't change or configure the *criteria* for the Default Rule.\n3. On the **Behavior** field, choose **Run Function**, and from the dropdown menu choose the **A/B Testing solution** according to the name you gave it.\n4. Add another behavior by clicking on the **+** button right bellow the first one.\n5. Pass the first behavior: **Bypass Cache**.\n6. Click again on the **+** button bellow the second behavior.\n7. Pass the second behavior needed: **Forward Cookies**.\n8. Click the **Save** button.\n\nDone. Now you'll have to wait for the edge application to propagate through Azion's edge nodes.\n\n---\n\nVisit the [use cases about the A/B Testing](/en/documentation/products/guides/ab-testing/) page for more information and reference.\n",

    "body": "\nThe edge function A/B Testing is a *serverless* solution available at Azion Marketplace.\n\nA/B tests solution allows the distribution of different scenarios to be better controlled during the test run, and to identify the most successful variants.\n\nSome other benefits of A/B Testing as an edge function include:\n\n1. Creating multiple variants in a single `JSON` file (A, B, C, and more).\n2. Varying how traffic flows.\n3. Combining test rules with business rules (WAF, bot protection, and more).\n4. Improving the users' experience. Compared to solutions that use JavaScript to perform A/B tests, the time it takes to load a page isn't affected and is significantly faster.\n\n---\n\n## How does the Azion Marketplace A/B Testing solution work?\n\nTest settings are defined in the function using `JSON` format parameters, called **Args**, which list attributes related to each version being tested, such as probability, cookie values, and others.\n\nThe function's algorithm distributes the request according to a defined probability when it arrives at one of Azion's edge nodes. Then, it sets the cookie with the expiry time and the values specified for each variable. From that point on, all traffic from the client that made the request is redirected to the selected version.\n\nWhen a new request is made by another client, a cookie is set and all traffic is redirected to another version (or even the same) according to the probability you set up. From this point on, all traffic from this client is redirected to this version.\n\nThe edge node then forwards the query to the originating application, which returns the content of the test page, and the edge delivers the content to the user.\n\n---\n\n## Setting up A/B Testing\n\nEdge Function A/B Testing is available from the Azion Marketplace and can be accessed through [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/) through **Products menu** > **Marketplace**.\n\nYou can understand how to install and configure an A/B test solution by reading the [How to install the A/B tests solution from Azion Marketplace](/en/documentation/products/guides/ab-testing-marketplace/) guide on the documentation page.\n\n---\n\n## Example of an A/B Testing JSON file configuration\n\nBelow is an example of what a `JSON` file configuration looks like for a basic **A/B Testing function**. In this particular case, the first variant is passed with a 90% (0.9) probability, and the second variant is passed with a 10% (0.1) probability.\n\n> Don't forget that the sum of the two probabilities must always be 1.\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"param\": {\n\t\t\"cookie\": {\n          \"name\": \"MYABTEST_NAME__\",\n          \"expiration\": \"Wed, 04 May 2021 10:16:00 GMT\",\n          \"max_age\": 600,\n          \"domain\": \"localhost\",\n          \"path\": \"/\"\n\t\t},\n        \"a\": {\n            \"cookie_value\": \"A_VARIANT\",\n            \"prob\": 0.9,\n            \"addresses_list\": \"www.mytest_ab_of_my_site.com:443\",\n            \"originid\": \"uuid1\",\n            \"live_ingest\": false,\n            \"protocol_policy\": \"https\",\n            \"path\": \"\",\n            \"cache_key\": \"test_a\",\n            \"host\": \"localhost\"\n        },\n        \"b\": {\n            \"cookie_value\": \"B_VARIANT\",\n            \"prob\": 0.1,\n            \"addresses_list\": \"www.mytest_ab_of_my_site.com:2010\",\n            \"originid\": \"uuid2\",\n            \"live_ingest\": false,\n            \"protocol_policy\": \"https\",\n            \"path\": \"\",\n            \"cache_key\": \"test_b\",\n            \"host\": \"localhost\"\n        }\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Defining the rules on Rules Engine\n\nThe set of conditions that must be met for *behaviors* to be executed are determined by the rules in the **Rules Engine**. You can use the **Default Rule** to run your function with no conditions, or create a new rule to configure trigger conditions of your function.\n\n### Defining validation criteria\n\nChoose the variables, comparison operators and strings to create your business rule, as in the following example:\n\n- `If: ${uri} is equal /home`\n\n> Logic: logical operator, variable, comparison operator, string.\n\nThis rule is executed if the URL accessed is equal to the string `mypagetotest.com/home`.\n\n### Defining validation behaviors\n\nAdd the *behaviors* you want to be carried out when the rule's conditions are met, as in the following example:\n\n`Then`: **Run Function** **MyABTestFunction**\n\n> Logic: logical operator, action, function.\n\nIn this example, if the conditions defined in the rules are satisfied, then the function **MyABTestFunction** will be executed.\n\nFinally, save your edge application and the new function will be ready.\n",

    "body": "\nAzion **Secure Token** is a *serverless* solution available at Azion Marketplace. \n\nThis solution allows you to process and validate tokens that can be used to control access to restricted or customized content. Lessons, videos, and images, for example.\n\nDespite the fact that access to this content is granted through interfaces that demand user authentication, it's possible to view these files directly by entering their URL, which makes them simple to distribute. The access is only granted after the token has been validated with the use of **Secure Token**, even if a URL is shared.\n\nOther benefits of **Secure Token** include:\n\n1. Flexibility in application development.\n2. Decentralized edge infrastructure to process the tokens.\n3. Capability of applying business rules at the edge.\n\n---\n\n## How the Secure Token solution works\n\nWhen implementing **Secure Token** access controls, the source application and the function on the edge have different roles:\n\n- **Originating application**: determines the logic around how the token is generated and also determines how users' access will be controlled. For example, which authentication method (OAUTH, OpenID Connect, etc.) will be used. The Token is a hash of the URL, whose content is being requested. It includes an expiry period for the token itself and a secret key.\n\n- **Secure Token**: validates the token generated by the application for each request received and sent by the user. If the token has expired, the secret key isn't correct, or the token isn't valid for the relevant URL, the access to the content will be denied.\n\nIt's also possible to combine these with other elements to define which behavior should be applied (authorize access or forward to the application, usually a login/sign-up page).\n\n---\n\n## Installing the Secure Token solution\n\nThe **Secure Token** is a solution available on the **Azion Marketplace**. This solution can be accessed through [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/) by selecting **Products menu**, indicated by the three horizontal lines on the upper-left corner, and then **Marketplace**.\n\n> In order to access RTM, you must have an Azion account. If you don't have one, you can [visit the sign-up page](https://manager.azion.com/signup).\n\nOnce you got to the **Marketplace** homepage, you can use the search box to find the **Secure Token** solution, or you can navigate through the cards until you find the Secure Token card. Click on it to get redirected to the Secure Token homepage. On the homepage, look for the **Subscribe for** section on the bottom-right corner and click on the **Get it now** button.\n\nYou can see how to instantiate and configure the Secure Token solution by visiting the [How to install the Secure Token solution through Azion Marketplace](/en//documentation/products/guides/securetoken/) guide on the documentation page.\n\n---\n\n## Defining the execution Criteria (Rules Engine)\n\nThe **Rules Engines** determine the set of *criteria* that need to be met for *behaviors* to be executed. You can either use the **Default Rule** or create a new rule after setting the validation parameters for the edge application to be executed.\n\nTo define the validation *criteria*, choose the variables, comparison operators, and strings to create your business rule.\n\nFor example:\n\n`If: ${uri} starts with /classes`\n\n**Logic**: logical operator, variable, comparison operator, string.\n\n> The rule is executed if the URL accessed starts with the string “/classes”.\n\nTo define the *behaviors*, add the actions you want to be carried out when the rule's conditions are met. \n\nFor example:\n\n`Then: Run Function MySecureToken`\n\n**Logic**: logical operator, action, function.\n\nIn this example, if the conditions defined in the rules are satisfied, then the **MySecureToken** function will be executed. If the token received is invalid, the function will return an HTTP status code 403 or 410, depending on the error. \n\nAfter configuration, click **Save**, and your Edge Application will be ready to execute your new function.\n",

    "body": "\nMarketing and editorial teams employ content targeting using cookies to deliver diverse experiences for users. Cookies are created for this task using JavaScript functions (client-side processing) or functions on the application backend (server-side processing), which instruct the content management application to reply with distinct content for each group of users.\n\nIt's feasible to create, evaluate, and carry out the variation of these cookies directly on the edge by using *serverless* functions and edge computing. These jobs, when done on the edge, improve customer experience, application performance, distribution assertiveness, and overall operating cost by eliminating the need for an additional processing flow.\n\n---\n\n## Content targeting using Azion Marketplace Content Targeting solution\n\n**Content Targeting** is a *serverless* solution available on **Azion Marketplace**. It allows you to create and manipulate cookies for flexible usage logics, such as content segmentation or handling specific application contexts, business rules, or any other scenario that the customer wishes to evaluate. You'll do that by creating different scenarios, specifying variants and distribution percentages for each scenario, with greater assertiveness and without burdening resources and interactions at the source.\n\nYou can also use the processing logic in the edge, broadening the function's applicability and reaping several benefits, such as:\n\n- Targeted cache.\n- Peak access absorption. \n- High performance.\n- Distributed processing logic.\n- Event registration via data streaming.\n\n---\n\n## How does Azion Marketplace Content Targeting solution work?\n\nWhen a request arrives at the edge, the algorithm distributes it based on the defined probability, and a cookie is established with the expiration time and the values supplied for each variant. A header can also be specified, which expands the possibilities for segmentation by **Rules Engine**.\n\n---\n\n## Setting up a scenario\n\nIn order to demonstrate a practical application for this solution, a scenario will be set, in which you want to randomly deliver four versions of a landing page through the variation of cookies. This is useful for behavior analysis later in data analytics tools (such as Google Analytics). In this scenario, the configuration file had to distribute the variants uniformly, allocating the same percentage of values to each one.\n\nThe **Content Targeting** solution is available at the Azion Marketplace. This solution can be accessed through [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/) by selecting **Products menu**, represented by the three horizontal lines on the upper-left corner, and then **Marketplace**.\n\n> In order to access RTM, you must have an Azion account.

In this case, it'll be **MyContentTargeting**, and save it by clicking the **Save** button.\n\n---\n\n## Configuring the Rules Engine\n\nOn the **Edge Applications** page, in the **Rules Engine** tab, you have to configure the rules you want (*criteria* and *behavior*) to apply to run your function.\n\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n1. Select the **Rules Engine** tab.\n2. Click on **Default Rule**.\n    - You can’t change the *criteria* field for the **Default Rule** on **Rules Engine**.\n3. On the *behavior* field, select **Run Function** from the dropdown menu and then select the **Content Targeting** function according to the name you gave it earlier. In this case, it'll be **MyContentTargeting**.\n4. Click the **Save** button.\n\nNow it's time to configure your application to deliver a different version of the landing page for each variation of cookies (`if mydomain_cookie = custom_a` -> `then deliver landing_page_a`, for example).\n\nFollow the evolution of conversion rates, abandonment and recurrence, among other metrics in your data analytics tools (Google Analytics, for example).\n",

On the upper-left corner of the page, select **Products menu** > **Marketplace**.\n3. Select the search box and type *“hcaptcha”* or browse through the cards to find the hCaptcha solution.\n4. Once you’ve found the hCaptcha card, select it to go to the solution page.\n5. On the solution page, look for the **Subscribe for** section on the bottom-right corner.\n6. Click the **Get It Now** button.\n\n> You’ll see a message indicating that your solution was successfully installed and is ready to use.\n\n---\n\n## Getting the keys on hCaptcha site\n\nTo use the hCaptcha solution, you have to provide two keys: your private key and your site key. To get these credentials, you'll have to register at the hCaptcha site. \n\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to the [hCaptcha dashboard](https://dashboard.hcaptcha.com/overview).\n    - If you don't have an account, you [can create one here](https://www.hcaptcha.com/signup-interstitial).\n    - Pay attention when creating a new account, because the site will provide your secret key. This secret key will be used to configure the solution later on.\n2. On the dashboard click the **New Site** button.\n3. It's optional, but recommended, to name your instance of hCaptcha.\n4. Fill in the `hostnames` you want to use the challenge on and click the **Add Domain** button.\n5. Choose your challenge mode:\n    - You have three options here: **Always Challenge** (free), **Passive** (paid), and **99.9% Passive** (paid). The difference between the three models is the heuristics applied on each access. For the *passive mode*, there's no challenge and the CAPTCHA will be triggered according to the behavior of the user. On the *99.9% passive*, the challenge will only appear for users at high risk of being bots. Ultimately, for the *free model*, with the always challenge being the only method available, every request will load a challenge.\n6. Choose the passing threshold you want for your site according to the difficulty level: *auto*, *easy*, *moderate*, and *difficult*. These modes will determine how accurate the user's answers should be to pass the test.\n7. With everything filled-up, click the **Save** button on the top-right corner.\n\nNow you have your site configured to use the hCaptcha solution. To configure our Azion's solution, you now have to get the site-key from hCaptcha. \n\nStill in the hCaptcha site, follow the steps:\n\n1. In your dashboard, on the upper-menu click on **Sites**.\n2. After loading the screen with your sites, choose the one you configured above.\n3. Click the **Settings** button (with the gear symbol).\n4. You'll see a textfield with a string chain that'll look like this:\n    - `efdb42c7-10ee-4969-8013-cfcb5f7ad007`. This is your site key.\n        - You can click on the **Try Out** button to see if everything's working.\n5. Save the site-key and the secret key to configure the Azion's solution.\n\n---\n\n## Using the solution\n\n### Setting up the Edge Firewall rule\n\nTo instantiate the hCaptcha solution, follow these steps:\n\n1. On the **Products menu**, select **Edge Firewall** in the **SECURE** section.\n2. Click the **Add Rule Set** button.\n3. Give an easy to remember name to your new rule.\n4. Select the domains you want to protect with the function.\n5. Click the **Function** switch to enable functions on your edge application.\n6. Click the **Save** button.\n\nDone. Now you have instantiated the rule for your function.\n\n---\n\n### Setting up the solution\n\nTo instantiate the hCaptcha solution, while still on the **Edge Firewall** page, select the **Functions** tab and follow these steps:\n\n1. Click the **Add Function** button.\n2. Give a name to your instance.\n3. On the dropdown menu, select the *hCaptcha function*.\n\nThis action will load the function, showing a form with the function's source-code and, just above it, two tabs: **Code** and **Args**. By clicking on the **Code** tab, you'll be able to navigate through the source-code, but won't be able to change it.\n\nIn the Args JSON file you'll pass the two keys you get on the hCaptcha site:\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"site_key\": \"efdb42c7-10ee-4969-8013-cfcb5f7ad007\",\n\t\"secret_key\": \"0x11c8eB6e78Bd45f058876aF59ac2fB782nbdswqu\",\n\t\"expiration_in_seconds\": 86400,\n\t\"domain\": \"xxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/\",\n\t\"after_check_redirect_url\": \"xxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/\",\n\t\"cookie_secret\": \"KEY_16_CHAR_LONG\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- `site_key`: the site key you obtained at the hCaptcha page.\n- `secret_key`: the secret key you obtained at the hCaptcha page.\n- `expiration_in_seconds`: the time *in seconds* until the hCaptcha expires.\n- `domain`: your domain.\n- `after_check_redirect_url`: the URL you want to redirect after the user passes the hCaptcha test.\n- `cookie_secret`: this cookie is generated by the function and used in order for the functions not to be re-run. \n\n> Due to the algorithm used in cryptography, the `cookie_secret` key must have 16 or 32 characters.\n\nClick the **Save** button to save your configuration.\n\nDone. Now your hCaptcha instance is saved.\n\n*Optionally*, you can pass other parameters to customize the messages you want on your hCaptcha and a custom HTML to render the challenge.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"custom_message\": \"My message\",\n    \"custom_html\": \"<html>... <!-- azion_captcha -->  .. </html>\",\n    \"captcha_args\": {\n        \"theme\": \"dark\",\n        \"size\": \"compact\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- `custom_message`: it's a customized message you want to show to the users.\n- `custom_html`: it's the customized HTML to render the hCaptcha challenge box.\n- `captcha_args`: you can use this to modify the layout of the challenge box to a different one from the default.\n\n---\n\n## Setting up the Edge Firewall Rules Engine\n\nTo finish, you have to set up the **Rules Engine** to configure the *behavior* and the *criteria* to run the function.\n\nStill on the **Edge Firewall** page, select the **Rules Engine** tab and follow these steps:\n\n1. Click the **New Rule** button.\n2. Give a name to the rule.\n3. Select a criteria to run and catch the domain you want to run the solution on. Example: `if Hostname is equal xxxxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`.\n4. Below, select a *behavior* to the *criteria*. In this case, it’ll be **Run Function**. \n    - Select the adequate hCaptcha function according to the name you gave it in the instantiate step.\n5. Click the **Save** button.\n\nDone. Now the hCaptcha solution is running for every request made to the domain you indicated.\n",

On the **Select an Edge Application** screen, select the **Edge Application** dropdown menu. It'll show a list with all your edge applications.\n2. Select the one you want to install the **Hello World** solution in.\n3. Next, you'll fill the Args needed to instantiate the Hello World solution.\n    - For this solution we have two Args: `Status` and `Body`.\n    - On the `Status` field, you have to pass the HTTP status code. For example, the default value is `200`, which indicates that the request was successful.\n    - For the `body` field, you can pass any string you want. This is the text that will be shown on the screen once your edge application is ready. The default value is `It works`.\n4. Finally, you'll have to give permissions to the Marketplace to access and modify your edge application.\n    - Every solution will have different permissions needs.\n    - The **Hello World** solution needs permission to read and write on your edge application's **Main Settings**, **Functions**, and **Rules Engine**.\n5. With the installation process finished, the screen will close and you'll see the green box on the top of the solution's homepage with the message `Your solution was successfully installed. Check the Overview and Usage Information sections for more details`, followed by a yellow box with the message `This solution was installed within a new disabled rule in your edge application. On your edge application management, under the Rules Engine tab, you may enable it`.\n    - The green box indicates that the solution was successfully installed and you can find more information about the solution and the next steps on these two sections of the solution's homepage.\n    - The yellow box indicates that you need to: access your edge application's **Main Settings** > select the **Rules Engine** tab > enable the generated rule. You have to perform these actions to put the new **Hello World** solution on the edge on a different path of the main application.\n\nDone.

The score is based on several factors, including whether the IP address was used for spamming or other malicious activity, how often the IP address was reported as suspicious or fraudulent, and other information. A higher score indicates the IP address has a better reputation and is less likely to be used maliciously. On the other hand, a lower score indicates that the IP address is more likely to be used for malicious activity and should be used with caution.\n\n---\n\n## Getting the solution\n\nTo use the IP Address Reputation solution provided at Azion’s **Marketplace**, follow these steps:\n\n1. Access [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com) and log in.\n    - If you don’t have an account yet, create one by visiting the [sign-up page](https://sso.azion.com/).\n2. On the upper-left corner of the page, select **Products Menu** > **Marketplace**.\n3. On the Marketplace’s homepage, type *“IP”* in the search box or browse through the cards below it to find the desired IP Address Reputation solution.\n4. Select the desired IP Address Reputation card. The solution’s page appears.\n5. On the **Subscribe for** section at the bottom-right corner of the page, click the **Get It Now** button.\n\n> A successful message appears. Your solution is installed and ready to use.\n\n---\n\n## Using the solution\n\nYour edge functions library holds the solutions you get on Marketplace. To use the IP Address Reputation solution, you must create a new edge application to use with your new IP Address Reputation function.\n\nTo learn how to create an edge application, visit the documentation on [getting started](/en/documentation/products/getting-started/). You can also create an edge application through **RTM** > **Products Menu** > **Edge Application** and follow the instructions.\n\n---\n\n## Getting the API Key at IPQualityScore\n\nTo use the IP Address Reputation, you'll have to obtain the API key at IPQualityScore. To do so, follow these steps:\n\n1. Create an [account at IPQualityScore](https://www.ipqualityscore.com/create-account).\n2. Wait for the email with your personal information.\n    - In the email you'll receive your API key. That's the only information you need to configure your solution.\n\n---\n\n## Configuring the solution\n\nOn the **Edge Application** page, locate the new IP Address Reputation edge application and select it.\n\nOn the **Main Settings** tab, locate the **Edge Functions** switch. This switch should be on the off position, you must turn it on:\n\n1. Activate the switch.\n2. On the bottom-right corner, click the **Save** button.\n\n> A successful message appears informing that the edge application is updated.\n\nThis will enable the **Functions** tab on your Edge Application, allowing you to instantiate the IP Address Reputation edge function on your edge application.\n\n---\n\n## Instantiating the solution\n\nTo enable the IP Address Reputation function, follow these steps:\n\n1. Still in the **Edge Application** page, select the **Functions** tab located in the top list.\n2. Click the **Add Function** button.\n3. On the edge function’s name text box, type an easy to remember name.\n4. On the dropdown function menu, select the IP Address Reputation function.\n    - This will load the function, showing a box with the code of the functions and two tabs: **Code** and **Args**.\n\n> The **Code** tab can't be edited. This tab is only to study the code of the function. Every parameter must be passed on the **Args** tab.\n\nOn the **Args** tab you'll change the configuration of your IP Address Reputation function. For this, select the **Args** tab to open the box for the **Args**. Here you can add the parameters to execute your application. On the **Args** tab you'll see the `JSON` file you have to edit to use the solution. \n\nThe `JSON` will look like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"api_key\": \"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\",\n  \"allow_public_access_points\": true,\n  \"fast\": true,\n  \"strictness\": 0,\n  \"lighter_penalties\": true,\n  \"user_language\": \"en-US\",\n  \"transaction_strictness\": 0\n}\n```\n\nTo run the solution, the only parameter you'll need to configure is the `api_key`, passing the API key you've received by email.\n\nThe other fields are:\n\n- `allow_public_access_points`: allows public connections. This is a boolean field, with the default value of `true`.\n- `fast`: enables a fast check. When you enable this parameter, your API won't do some forensic checks. This is a boolean field, with the default value of `true`.\n- `strictness`: Fraud Scoring, higher values (above 2) have more chance to return false positives. Use the range `0-3` for this. This is an integer field, with the default value of 0.\n- `lighter_penalties`: lowers the score for proxy IPn addresses, preventing false positives. This is a boolean field, with the default value of `true`.\n- `user_language`: the user header language. This is a string field with no default value.\n- `transaction_strictness`: adjusts penalty weights for irregularities and fraud patterns detected on order and transaction details optionally provided with each API request. This feature is only useful when providing order and transaction details. This is an integer field with no default value.\n\nSome other parameters, that aren't in the `JSON` example provided at the Args box, could be used. They are:\n\n- `when_score_above`: sets a score threshold. Whenever the IPQS Risk Score exceeds this threshold, the function will perform the action defined by the `execute` argument. If the value isn't set, then no action will be taken by the function. This is an integer field with no default value.\n- `execute`: the action that will be performed when `when_score_above` threshold was surpassed. This is a string field with three possible values: `deny`, `drop`, `add_header`. There's no default value.\n- `get_data_from`: determines if the IP will be retrieved from a querystring request from the header or from the body. If the value is `remote_addr`, the value that will be extracted is: `ngx.var.remote_addr`. This is a string field with four possible values: `remote_addr`, `querystring`, `body`, `header`. The default value is `remote_addr`.\n- `data_name`: identify the field or argument from when the IPQS function will extract the IP to validate. This is only used when the parameter `search_in` is different from the parameter `remote_addr`. This is a string field, with the default value of `X-Forwarded-For`.\n\n---\n\n## Configuring a rule on Rules Engine\n\nStill in the **Edge Application** page, in the **Rules Engine** tab, you have to configure the rules you want (*criteria* and *behavior*) to apply in order to run your function.\n\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n1. Select the **Rules Engine** tab.\n2. Click on **Default Rule**.\n3. On the *behavior* field, select **Run Function** from the dropdown menu and then select the **IP Address Reputation** function, according to the name you gave it in the instantiation step.\n\n> Note: you can't change the criteria field for the Default Rule on Rules Engine.\n\n5. Click the **Save** button.\n\n---\n\n#### Important\n\nIt's a good practice to create another rule redirecting your application to another URL. If the IP Address Reputation finds no errors, you won't see any messages. If you don't want or need it, you can follow the usage of your API key through the IPQualityScore dashboard. Every refresh on your edge application will count as a new request for IP address lookup. \n\nFor each field present in the results, the solution will add the prefix `IPQS` to the request header. This means that for each query, the header will have a prefix with the field. For example, if the request has an `ASN` field, the header will have an `IPQS-ASN` with the same value added to the header. You can also use this information to create and manage your decisions in the Rules Engine. You can find a [full list of fields here] (https://www.ipqualityscore.com/documentation/proxy-detection/overview).\n",

    "body": "\nThe **Massive Redirect** edge function is a *serverless* solution available at Azion Marketplace. It's designed to handle a large number of redirects and can be used when a large number of addresses need to be changed, for example, when migrating domains.\n\nBy centralizing the management of multiple settings in one place, this application allows you to control redirects directly at the edge. In this way, you can handle different situations such as CMS or e-commerce platform migrations, or website updates.\n\nSome of the other benefits of using the Massive Redirect solution for domain migration include:\n\n1. Managing multiple redirects centrally. There's no need to create a request phase rule for each redirect.\n2. Reducing negative SEO impact.\n3. Reducing search engine ranking risk for the affected pages.\n4. Enabling processing at the edge, offloading resources from the source infrastructure.\n\n---\n\n## How Massive Redirect works\n\nThe function deals with the redirection of traffic according to the settings specified by the **Args** parameters and the validation criteria defined in the **Rules Engine** of **Edge Application**.\n\nWhen a request to an address, configured in the parameters, reaches any of the Azion's edge nodes, the function identifies that it needs redirection. Then, it redirects the request to the new address. The originating application receives the request and returns the content for the edge node to send to the user with the appropriate HTTP status—301 or 302, depending on the configuration.\n\nThe redirecting that the function needs to perform is defined by using a list of parameters in `JSON`, consisting of pairs containing the old address and the destination address (**Args**), as shown next:\n\n- `old address`: this can be listed exactly or by using a regular expression from the options below:\n    - `from`: full address.\n    - `from_regex`: regular expression to represent a standard URL format, allowing you to configure more than one address using a single rule. These expressions must be in the form of Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) patterns.\n- `destination address`: can be written in two ways:\n    - `moved`: destination (URL) that will be permanently redirected (HTTP status 301).\n    - `found`: destination (URL) that will be temporarily redirected (HTTP status 302).\n\nTherefore, the configuration of a list of redirects would have the following format:\n\n``` json\n[{\n   \"from\": \"https://www.old-site.com/\",\n   \"moved\": \"https://www.new-site.com\"\n},\n{\n    \"from\": \"https://www.old-site.com/shoes-snekears.html\",\n    \"moved\": \"https://www.new-site.com/category/shoes/sneakers\"\n},\n{\n    \"from\": \"https://www.old-site.com/users-login.html\",\n    \"found\": \"https://www.new-site.com/login.html\"\n},\n{\n    \"from_regex\": \"https://(api|store|checkout)\\\\.old-site\\\\.com$\",\n    \"moved\": \"https://www.new-site.com/%1$\"\n}]\n```\n\n---\n\n## List with multiple redirects in a single Args configuration\n\nBased on the information contained in the **Args**, the function will carry out an interpretation of addresses and redirects, as it's explained in detail next.\n\n## Configuring the Massive Redirect function\n\nThe edge function Massive Redirect is available on Azion Marketplace and can be accessed through [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/), on the **Products menu** on the upper-left corner, represented by three horizontal lines.\n\nThe function can only be executed when it has been **instanced** in the edge application that you intend to work in, and when the activation *criteria* and *behaviors* have been defined in the **Rules Engine**.\n\n---\n\n## Creating an instance\n\nTo create a Massive Redirect function, you can refer to the guide on [How to install the Massive Redirect from Azion Marketplace](/en/documentation/products/guides/content-targeting/).\n\n---\n\n## Defining the Execution criteria on Rules Engine\n\nThe rules (Rules Engine) determine the set of conditions that need to be met for *behaviors* to be executed. You can either use the Default Rule or create a new one to set the parameters for validating and the behaviors that the edge application will execute.\n\n### Defining the validation criteria (criteria)\n\nChoose the *variables*, *comparison operators*, and *strings* to create your business rule, as in the example below:\n\n`if: ${domain} is equal old-site.com`\n\n> Logic: logical operator, variable, comparison operator, string.\n\nIn this example, if the domain accessed is the same as the string `old-site.com`, the rule will be executed.\n\n### Defining behaviors (behaviors)\n\nAdd the *behaviors* you want to be carried out when the rule's conditions are met, as in the example below:\n\n`Then Run Function` and chose **MyMassiveRedirect**, or any other name you gave it.\n\n> Logic: logical operator, action, function.\n\nIn this example, if the conditions defined in the rules are satisfied, then the function **MyMassiveRedirect** will be executed.\n\nFinally, save your configurations and your edge application will be ready to run this new function.\n",

The Google's solution has been around for a long time and Google uses the data collected by reCAPTCHA to improve their services.\n\nAlong many features that you'll find with reCaptcha, it's possible to highlight the following:\n\n- API integration, which allows website owners to implement reCAPTCHA on their site.\n- Different types of challenges, such as image and audio-based challenges, that can be customized to the needs of the website.\n- Security features, such as rate limiting and automatic blocking of suspicious traffic, which help to protect your assets against bots and automated scripts.\n- Accessibility options for visually impaired users, such as an audio version of the challenge.\n\n---\n\n## Getting the solution\n\nreCaptcha is a *serverless* solution available at Azion Marketplace. This type of solution is mainly used for protecting domains against bots. It allows you to monitor traffic in your website by using the Google Dashboard for reCaptcha.\n\nTo use the reCaptcha solution provided by Azion Marketplace, you have to:\n\n1. Log in to your [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/) account.\n    - If you don’t have one yet, [create an account](https://manager.azion.com/signup/) by visiting the sign-up page.\n2. On the upper left corner of the page, select **Products menu** > **Marketplace**.\n3. Select the search box and type *“recaptcha”* or browse through the cards to find the reCaptcha solution.\n4. Once you’ve found the reCaptcha card, select it to go to the solution page.\n5. On the solution page, look for the **Subscribe for** section on the bottom right corner.\n6. Click the **Get It Now** button.\n\n> You’ll see a message indicating that your solution was successfully installed and is ready to use.\n\n---\n\n## Getting the keys on Google's reCaptcha site\n\nTo use the reCaptcha solution, you have to provide two keys: your `secret-key` and your `site-key`. \n\nTo get these credentials, you'll have to register at Google. \n\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to [Google reCaptcha admin dashboard](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha).\n - If you don't have a Google Account, you'll be prompted to create one.\n2. Once you've signed-up to the reCaptcha account, you'll be redirected to the website register page.\n3. On this page you have to fill in:\n    - A label for your new reCaptcha site.\n    - Which version of reCaptcha you want to use (you can choose from v2 or v3).\n        - If you choose v2, you'll be prompted to choose what kind of test you want to apply on your website. The options are: \"*I'm not a robot checkbox*\", \"*Invisible reCaptcha*\", and \"*reCaptcha Android*\".\n        > **Important**: keep in mind that the Azion Marketplace reCaptcha solution was conceived to work with the v2 invisible option.\n    - For what domain you want to run the reCaptcha. Remember to ignore the `http://` or `https://` for the domain name.\n    - You have to accept the reCaptcha terms of service.\n    - You have to choose if you want to receive alerts from Google about your site, such as misconfigurations and others.\n    - Once you fill in all the information, click the **Submit** button.\n4. Now you have your site registered to use the reCaptcha. In the next screen, you'll receive your keys: `Site Key` and `Secret Key`.\n\nThese two keys will be used to configure the Azion's reCaptcha solution later on.\n\n---\n\n## Using the solution\n\n### Setting up the Edge Firewall rule\n\nTo instantiate the reCaptcha solution, follow the steps:\n\n1. Under **Products menu**, select **Edge Firewall** in the **SECURE** section.\n2. Click the **Add Rule Set** button.\n3. Give an easy to remember name to your new rule.\n3. Select the domains you want to protect with the function.\n4. Click the **Function** switch to enable functions on your edge application..\n5. Click the **Save** button.\n\nDone. Now you have instantiated the rule for your function.\n\n### Setting up the Edge Firewall function\n\nTo instantiate the reCaptcha solution, while still on the Edge Firewall page, select the **Functions** tab and follow these steps:\n\n1. Click the **Add Function** button.\n2. Give an easy to remember name to your instance.\n3. On the dropdown menu, select the **reCaptcha** function.\n\n> After you select the solution, a **Code** box will be loaded. This is just for study and can’t be modified.\n\nIn the same box, you have another tab: the **Args** tab. On the Args tab, you’ll pass the credentials you've obtained on the Google reCaptcha page.\n\nThe Args tab will load a JSON file which looks like this:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"site_key\": \"site-key\",\n    \"secret_key\": \"private-key\",\n    \"expiration_in_seconds\": 86400,\n    \"domain\": \".azion.com\",\n    \"after_check_redirect_url\": \"https://www.azion.com\",\n    \"cookie_secret\": \"KEY_16_CHAR_LONG\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- `site_key`: the site key you've obtained at Google's reCaptcha page.\n- `secret_key`: the secret key you've obtained at Google reCaptcha page.\n- `expiration_in_seconds`: the time *in seconds* until the reCaptcha expires.\n- `domain`: your domain.\n- `after_check_redirect_url`: the URL you want to redirect after the user passes the reCaptcha test.\n- `cookie_secret`: this cookie is generated by the function and used in order for the functions to not re-run. \n\n> Due to the algorithm used in cryptography, the `cookie_secret` key must have 16 or 32 characters.\n\n4. Click the **Save** button.\n\nDone. Now your reCaptcha instance is saved.\n\n*Optionally*, you can pass other parameters to customize the messages you want on your reCaptcha and a custom HTML to render the challenge.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"custom_message\": \"My message\",\n    \"custom_html\": \"<html>... <!-- azion_captcha -->  .. </html>\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere:\n- `custom_message`: it's a customized message you want to show to the users.\n- `custom_html`: it's the customized HTML to render the reCaptcha challenge box.\n\n---\n\n## Setting up the Edge Firewall Rules Engine\n\nTo finish, you have to set up the **Rules Engine** to configure the *behavior* and the *criteria* to run the function.\n\nStill on the **Edge Firewall** page, select the **Rules Engine** tab and follow these steps:\n\n1. Click the **New Rule** button.\n2. Give a name to the rule.\n3. Select a criteria to run and catch the domain you want to run the solution on. Example: `if Hostname is equal xxxxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`.\n4. Below, select a *behavior* to the *criteria*. In this case, it’ll be **Run Function**. \n    - Select the adequate reCaptcha function according to the name you gave it in the instantiate step.\n5. Click the **Save** button.\n\nDone. Now the reCaptcha solution is running for every request made to the domain you indicated.\n",

This cookie will be used for the second solution, the Hash Validator, which checks the number of variations made and blocks access to the origin whenever the user exceeded the maximum number permitted.\n\n---\n\n## Getting the solution\n\nThe Request Variation Controller solution is a serverless solution available at Azion Marketplace.\n\nRemember, this solution is divided into two. To run it, you have to install the hash generator and the hash validator.\n\nWith the help of this solution, a signed cookie can be created or updated, containing details about how many different requests were made in succession to an edge application.\n\n1. Log in to your [Real-Time Manager (RTM) account](https://manager.azion.com/).\n    - If you don’t have one yet, create an account visiting the [sign-up page](https://manager.azion.com/signup/).\n2.

To use the solution, you'll have to create a new edge application.\n\nTo create an edge application you have three options:\n\n- By visiting the documentation on [getting started](/en/documentation/products/getting-started/). \n- Through **RTM**, on the upper-left corner of the page, select **Products menu** > **Edge Application** and follow the instructions.\n- Using an already existing edge application.\n\n---\n\n## Configuring the solution\n\nTo configure your solution, proceed as follows:\n\n1. On the upper-left corner, select **Products menu** > **Edge Application** on the **BUILD** section.\n2. On the listing page of your edge applications, select the one you’ve created to use with the Request Variation Controller solution.\n3. On the application page, on the **Main Settings** tab, locate the **Functions** switch and turn it on to enable Functions on your edge application.\n4. Still on the application page, on the **Main Settings** tab, locate the **Application Acceleration** switch and turn it on to enable the *Forward Cookies* functionality for your application; this will be addressed at the [Rules Engine section](#rules-engine).\n5. Click the **Save** button.\n\n> You’ll receive a message indicating your edge application was successfully updated.\n\n---\n\n## Instantiating the solution\n\nTo enable this function, while still on the **Edge Application** page:\n\n1. Select the **Functions** tab on the top list.\n2. Click the **Add Function** button.\n3. Choose an easy to remember name for your function.\n4. On the dropdown function menu, select the *Variation Request* function.\n\nThis action will load the function, showing a form with the function code and, just above it, two tabs: **Code** and **Args**. By clicking on the Code tab you will be able to navigate through the code, but won't be able to change it.\n\nAs you have two solutions, you'll have to configure two Args tabs, one for the response phase and another one for the request phase.\n\nFor the **response phase**, the Args are:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"cookie_name\": \"azn\",\n    \"cookie_secret\": \"1234567890123456\",\n    \"cookie_max_age\": 45,\n    \"args_list\": [\"http_x_something\", \"http_x_another_thing\",\n    \"request_body_userid\"]\n}\n```\n**Where**:\n\n`cookie_name`: defines the name of the cookie. The default value is \"azn\".\n`cookie_secret`: defines the key used to encrypt the signed cookie. Due to the encryption algorithm used here, the AES-128, this key must have exactly 16 chars.\n`cookie_max_age`: define the time for the expiration of the cookie. If you don't define any time (passing a null value or none value), the cookie will be a session cookie. The default value is 45.\n`args_list`: defines the nginx list of variables that will be analyzed on the user's request. Whenever this changes, the count of changes will be increased. These parameters will be used to block or allow the access.\n\nFor the **request phase**, the Args are:\n\n```json\n{\n\"cookie_name\": \"azn\",\n\"cookie_secret\": \"1234567890123456\",\n\"max_variation\": 6,\n\"max_unique_variation\": 2\n}\n```\n\n**Where**:\n\n`cookie_name`: defines the name of the cookie. It must be the same as the one defined at the response phase.\n`cookie_secret`: defines the secret key for the cookie. It must be the same as the one defined at the response phase.\n`max_variation`: defines the maximum number of any kind of variation in the parameters.\n`max_unique_variation`: defines the maximum number of unique variations in the parameters.\n\nThis function decrypts the signed cookie and checks to see if any cookie variants have been reached. If they have, a new request header with the name `[COOKIE_ NAME]-[VIOLATION TYPE]-[TRUE]` will be appended to the request.\n\n**Possible violations can assume 3 values:**\n\n- **All Variations**: regardless of whether there are repeated values, it counts the number of times the cookie's value was altered. For instance, if the cookie value changed from \"nothing\" to \"A\" in the first request, \"A\" to \"B\" in the second, \"C\" in the third, \"B\" to \"C\" in the fourth, \"B\" to \"A\" in the fifth, and finally \"A\" in the sixth request, the total number of variations would be 5. If the cookie has the default name, the violation header that is added to the request when this violation occurs is `http_cookie_name_any_variation_violation`.\n\n- **Unique variations**: counts the number of distinct values that have been assigned to the cookie since its creation. Given that the cookie only had \"A,\" \"B,\" and \"C\" as distinct values, the unique variation for the same example as above would be 3. Assuming the cookie has the default name, when this violation occurs, a violation header called `http_cookie_name_unique_variation_violation` would be added to the request.\n\n- **Signature Violation**: when the function is unable to decrypt the signed cookie (for example, because it was signed with a different key or because the cookie was altered on the client side), this violation will be brought about. Assuming the cookie has the default name, when this violation is triggered, the request will have the violation header `http_cookie_name_signature_violation` added to it.\n\n---\n\n## Configuring a rule on Rules Engine\n\nStill in the **Edge Application** page, in the **Rules Engine** tab, you have to configure the rules you want (*criteria* and *behavior*) to apply to run your function.\n\nYou have to configure the **response phase** for the Rules Engine.\n\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n1. Select the **Rules Engine** tab.\n2. Click the **New Rule** button and select **Response Phase**.\n3. Give an easy to remember name to your rule.\n4. Pass the *criteria* you need to in order to run your solution.\n5. On the behavior field, select **Run Function** from the dropdown menu and then select the *Variation Request - Hash Generator* function, according to the name you gave it in the instantiation step.\n6. Click the **Save** button.\n\nNow, you have to configure the **request phase** for the Rules Engine.\n\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n1. Select the **Rules Engine** tab.\n2. Click the **New Rule** button and select **Request Phase**.\n3. Give an easy to remember name to your rule.\n4. Pass the *criteria* you need to in order to run your solution.\n5. On the behavior field, select **Run Function** from the dropdown menu and then select the *Variation Request - Hash Validator* function, according to the name you gave it in the instantiation step.\n6. You'll need a **second** behavior for the Request Variation Controller function, the *Forward Cookies*. To add this, click the `+` button and select the *Forward Cookies* option from the dropdown menu.\n7. Click the **Save** button.\n\nDone. You've successfully instantiated your two solutions and now you're protected against attackers.\n",

In the same box, there's the **Args** tab, which is where you’ll pass the parameters you want to use with your solution.\n\nThe **Args** tab will load a `JSON` file that looks like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"schedule\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"deny\",\n      \"execute_action_when\": \"in_interval\",\n      \"interval\": {\n        \"starts_at_utc\": \"00:00\",\n        \"finishes_at_utc\": \"00:59\"\n      },\n      \"week_days\": {\n        \"Sun\": true,\n        \"Mon\": true,\n        \"Tue\": true,\n        \"Wed\": true,\n        \"Thu\": true,\n        \"Fri\": false,\n        \"Sat\": true\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"drop\",\n      \"execute_action_when\": \"not_in_interval\",\n      \"interval\": {\n        \"starts_at_utc\": \"01:00\",\n        \"finishes_at_utc\": \"20:00\"\n      },\n      \"week_days\": {\n        \"Mon\": true,\n        \"Tue\": true\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"action\": \"static_response\",\n      \"execute_action_when\": \"in_interval\",\n      \"static_response_data\": {\n        \"status\": 503,\n        \"message\": \"You can write a custom message here\",\n        \"html\": \"<!-- Some HTML can go here -->\"\n      },\n      \"interval\": {\n        \"starts_at_utc\": \"20:00\",\n        \"finishes_at_utc\": \"23:59\"\n      },\n      \"week_days\": {\n        \"Sun\": true,\n        \"Sat\": true\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nThe arguments that you can pass on this `JSON` file are the following:\n\n| Atribute | Data Type | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| `action`| String | Defines the action which the function will execute whenever a request matches the trigger criteria. <br /><br />Possible values are: <br />`Deny`: it will close the request with an HTTP 403 Forbidden response.<br />`Drop`: it will close the request without sending any response to the client.<br />`static_response`: it will close the request with a static response to it. |\n| `execute_action_when` | String | Possible values are:<br />`in_interval`<br />`not_in_interval` <br /><br />When this argument is set to `in_interval`, the `action` will be executed whenever this function is called during the defined time interval.<br />When this argument is set to `not_in_interval`, the `action` will be executed whenever this function is called out of the defined time interval. |\n| `interval` | Dictionary of Strings | Defines the time interval.<br />The values must be in the format \"HH:MM\", based on a 24 hour clock.<br />Note: This function is used in the UTC time zone. |\n| `interval.starts_at_utc` | String | Defines the starting time of the interval. |\n| `interval.finishes_at_utc` | String | Defines the ending time of the interval. |\n| `week_days` | Dictionary of Booleans | Defines the days of the week when the function will be executed.<br />The indexes of the dictionary represent each day of the week. They are expected to use a 3 letter format (EEE), starting with capital case. If an invalid day is used, it'll be ignored.<br />Note that if a day is not present in the dictionary, it will be considered as `false`. |\n| `static_response_data` | Dictionary of Strings | Allows the customization of the static response page which will be returned whenever the action is set to `static_response`. |\n| `static_response_data.status` | Number | The status code used in the static response. |\n| `static_response_data.message` | String | Allows you to customize the message displayed in the static response page. |\n| `static_response_data.html` | String | Allows you to provide a custom HTML to be used when delivering the static response. |\n\n> Note that for `static_response` parameter in `action`, you can define the status code that will be used in the response, as well as set a custom HTML page that will be delivered to your users.\n\nClick the **Save** button and you're done.

    "body": "\nAzion **Secure Token** is a *serverless* solution available at Azion Marketplace.\n\nWith the help of the Azion Secure Token solution, you can make token-based, time-limited URLs. The creation and validation of signatures for cookies, authentication headers, and other security measures can be done using these tokens, which can be altered in a variety of ways. Utilizing both HLS and Progressive Download, the solution is frequently used to secure video assets, including those used for live streaming and on-demand content.\n\n---\n\n## Getting the solution\n\nTo use the Secure Token solution provided by Azion Marketplace, you have to:\n\n1. Log in to your [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/) account.\n    - If you don’t have one yet, create an account [visiting the sign-up page](https://manager.azion.com/signup/). \n2. On the upper-left corner of the page, select **Products menu** > **Marketplace**.\n3. Select the search box and type “*secure token*” or browse through the cards to find the Secure Token solution.\n4. Once you’ve found the Secure Token card, select it to go to the solution page.\n5. On the solution page, look for the **Subscribe for** section on the bottom-right corner.\n6. Click the **Get It Now** button.\n\n> You’ll see a message indicating that your solution was successfully installed and is ready to use.\n\n---\n\n## Generating the token\n\nIn order to use this solution, you'll have to generate a token. To do so, follow these steps:\n\n1. Go to the [Azion's Secure Token GitHub repository](https://github.com/aziontech/azion_secure_token).\n    - In this repository, you'll find a brief explanation about how the Secure Token is generated and how to use it.\n2. In the repository, you'll find two example scripts to generate the tokens, a `Python` and a `PHP` script. You can run them locally and generate the token or you can generate these tokens on your own platform with your own code.\n3. Save the generated token, whatever may be the way you generated it through.\n\n> Note: using the Python script as an example, you'll have the following source code:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nimport base64\nimport hashlib\n\nsecret = 'mysecret'\nuri = '/my/uri'\nexpire = '1470055000'\n\nmd5 = hashlib.md5()\nmd5.update(secret + uri + expire)\ntoken = base64.b64encode(md5.digest()).replace('=','').replace('+','-').replace('/','_')\n\nprint 'http://www.example.org%s?st=%s&e=%s' % (uri, token, expire)\n```\n\nWhere:\n- `secret` = a string of your choice that will be used to generate the token.\n- `uri` = the URI to use with the token.\n- `expire` = the expiration time of the token.\n\n---\n\n## Using the solution\n\n### Setting up the Edge Firewall rule\n\nTo instantiate the Secure Token solution, follow the steps:\n\n1. In the **Products menu**, select **Edge Firewall** in the **SECURE** section.\n2. Click the **Add Rule Set** button.\n3. Give an easy to remember name to your new rule.\n4. Select the domains you want to protect with the function.\n5. Turn the **Edge Functions** switch on.\n6. Click the **Save** button.\n\nDone. Now you've instantiated the rule for your function.\n\n### Setting up the solution\n\nTo instantiate the Secure Token solution, while still on the Edge Firewall page, select the **Functions** tab and follow these steps:\n\n1. Click the **Add Function** button.\n2. Give an easy-to-remember name to your instance.\n3. On the dropdown menu, select the **Secure Token** function.\n\nThis action will load the function, showing a form with the function code and, just above it, two tabs: **Code** and **Args**. By clicking the **Code** tab, you'll be able to navigate through the code but not change it. In the same box, you have another tab: the **Args** tab. On the **Args** tab, you’ll pass the secret that you used to generate the token previously.\n\nThe **Args** tab will load a JSON file that looks like this:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"secure_token_secret\": \"thatisthesecret\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere the `secure_token_secret` will be the secret string you've passed on the code when generating the token on the previous step.\n\nClick the **Save** button and you're done. Your Edge Firewall Secure Token solution is instantiated.\n\n---\n\n## Setting up the Rules Engine\n\nTo finish, you have to set up the [Rules Engine](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/rules-engine/) to configure the *behavior* and the *criteria* to run the function.\n\nStill in the **Edge Firewall** page, select the **Rules Engine** tab and follow these steps:\n\n1. Click the **New Rule** button.\n2. Give a name to the rule.\n3. Select a *criteria* to run and catch the domain you want to run the solution on. For example: `if Hostname is equal xxxxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/classes`.\n4. Below, select the **Run Function** *behavior* to the *criteria*.\n  - Select the adequate **Secure Token** function according to the name you gave it in the instantiate step.\n5. Click the **Save** button.\n\nDone. Now the Secure Token solution is running for every request made to the domain you indicated.\n\n> **Important**: Azion Nginx running on edge servers performs two checks on tokens: whether the current time is greater than the expiration time specified in the token, and whether the signature matches the token signature. If the signature is invalid, Nginx returns a 403 error, and if the expiry time is exceeded, it returns a 410 error. Malicious users aren't able to change token expiry time without breaking signature.\n\n---\n\nYou can find some examples of code snippets at the [Azion public GitHub repository](https://github.com/aziontech/azion_secure_token) for Secure Token solution and you can read a [use case for this solution](/en/documentation/products/guides/secure-token/) at Azion's documentation page.\n",

Click the **Add Function** button.\n2. Give an easy to remember name to your instance.\n3. On the dropdown menu, select the **Send Event to Endpoint** function.\n\nAfter you select the solution, a **Code** form with the solution's source code will be loaded. This is just for study and can’t be modified. In the same form you have another tab: the **Args** tab. On the **Args** tab, you’ll pass the parameters to configure your solution.\n\nThe `JSON` **Args** form for this solution will look like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"metadata\": [\"remote_addr\"],\n  \"headers\": [\"x-hello\"],\n  \"body\": [\"message\", \"user.id\"],\n  \"connection_args\": {\n\t\"endpoint\": \"http://example_api:3000/test\",\n\t\"headers\": {\n  \t\"Authorization\": \"FakeAuth\",\n  \t\t\"X-Provider\": \"Azion Cells\"\n\t}\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Where**: \n\n| Field | Is Required | Data Type | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| `metadata` | No | Null or Array | Defines which metadata fields will be streamed.<br /><br />When `null` (or not set), all metadata fields will be streamed.<br /><br />If you don't want to stream any metadata, you must set an empty array `[ ]` as the value of this field. |\n| `headers` | No | Null or Array | Defines which request headers will be streamed.<br /><br />When `null` (or not set), all request headers will be streamed.<br /><br />If you don't want to stream any header, you must set an empty array `[ ]` as the value of this field. |\n| `body` | No | Null or Array | Defines which request body fields will be streamed.<br /><br />When `null` (or not set), all request body fields will be streamed.<br /><br />If you don't want to stream any body field, you must set an empty array `[ ]` as the value of this field.<br /><br />To filter multi-level fields, use the dot notation. For example, if you use the string 'user.name' here, the function will seek for the field 'name' within the object 'user' in the request body. |\n| `connection_args` | Yes | Object | Defines the data that will be used to stream the request data.<br /><br />The URL to which the data will be posted is defined by the endpoint.<br /><br />The headers specify which headers will be included in the fetch request.<br /><br />An additional 'Content-Type: application/json' header will be used. |\n| `s3_connection_args` | No | Object | Defines the arguments used to connect to the S3 bucket. |\n| `s3_connection_args.full_host` | Only when using `s3_connection_args` | String | Defines the full host of the S3 bucket. |\n| `s3_connection_args.region` | Only when using <br />`s3_connection_args` | String | Defines the region of the S3 bucket. |\n| `s3_connection_args.access_key` | Only when using <br />`s3_connection_args` | String | Defines the access key to be used in the connection to the S3 bucket. |\n| `s3_connection_args.secret_key` | Only when using <br />`s3_connection_args` | String | Defines the secret key to be used in the connection to the S3 bucket. |\n| `s3_connection_args.file_path` | No | String | Defines the path where the file created by the function must be stored.<br /><br />Default value:<br /> `/` |\n| `s3_connection_args.use_date_prefix` | No | String | When enabled, it'll include a sub-folder with the current date (in format YYYY-MM-DD) to the file path.<br /><br />Default value:<br /> `true` |\n\nThis solution will return a response with the data streamed in a `JSON` file that will look like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"body\": {\n\t\"field_a\": <data>,\n\t...\n  },\n  \"geoip_asn\": <data>,\n  \"geoip_city\": <data>,\n  \"geoip_city_continent_code\": <data>,\n  \"geoip_city_country_code\": <data>,\n  \"geoip_city_country_name\": <data>,\n  \"geoip_continent_code\": <data>,\n  \"geoip_country_code\": <data>,\n  \"geoip_country_name\": <data>,\n  \"geoip_region\": <data>,\n  \"geoip_region_name\": <data>,\n  \"headers\": {\n\t\"x-header-a\": <data>,\n\t...\n  },\n  \"remote_addr\": <data>,\n  \"remote_port\": <data>,\n  \"remote_user\": <data>,\n  \"request_id\": <data>,\n  \"request_url\": <data>,\n  \"server_protocol\": <data>,\n  \"ssl_cipher\": <data>,\n  \"ssl_protocol\": <data>\n}\n```\n\nNotice how the `request_id`, `request_url`, and metadata fields will be delivered in the root of the `JSON` file, whereas the body fields and request headers will be sent in objects.\n\n**Important**: you can also use a \"catch-all\" `JSON` Args file, like this:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"connection_args\": {\n        \"endpoint\": \"http://example_api:3000/test\", \n    }\n}\n```\n### 2.3 S3 output files\n\nFor each new function run, a new file will be produced in the given S3 bucket. The file will be named after the request ID that initiated the function. \n\nExample: if the `connection_args.file_path` parameter is set to `/my-data/` and the function is performed on May 9th, 2023, with the request ID `abcd-1234`, the resultant file will be saved at `/my-data/2023-05-09/abcd-1234.json`. If the `connection_args.use_date_prefix` parameter is set to `false`, the resultant file will be saved as `/my-data/abcd-1234.json`.\n\nIf there are no `http_connection_args` or `s3_connection_args` supplied in the JSON Args, the function doesn't have any valid connection arguments to utilize. Then, the request will be terminated, and a `JSON` error message will be sent to indicate the cause of the issue.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": \"A001\",\n  \"detail\": \"The function instance is missing or has invalid required arguments.\"\n}\n```\n\nIf the function is unable to connect to the HTTP endpoint or the S3 provider, the user request will be ignored. Regardless, an error log will be created, which the client may access via Data Streaming.\n\nFor example, if an invalid access key is used, the following notice will be displayed:\n\n```json\n[Send event to endpoint] S3 connection error; \n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"yes\"?>\n<Error>\n\t<Code>InvalidAccessKeyId</Code>\n\t<Message>The key 'DAKEY' is not valid</Message>\n</Error>\n```\n\nAt last, if you supply the correct connection options for both the HTTP endpoint and the S3 bucket, the function will deliver event data to both sources at the same time.\n\n---\n\n## Setting up Rules Engine\n\nTo finish, you have to set up the **Rules Engine** to configure the *behavior* and the *criteria* to run the solution.\n\nStill in the **Edge Firewall** page, select the **Rules Engine** tab and follow these steps:\n\n1. Click the **New Rule** button.\n2. Give an easy to remember name to the rule.\n3. Select a *criteria* to run and catch the domain you want to run the solution on. For example: `if Hostname is equal xxxxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`.\n4. Below, select a *behavior* to the *criteria*. In this case, it’ll be **Run Function**. Then, select the adequate **Send Event to Endpoint** function according to the name you gave it in the instantiating step.\n\nDone. Now the **Send Event to Endpoint** solution is running for every request made to the domain you indicated.\n",

    "body": "\nSending messages to a queue refers to the process of adding messages to a message queue, which is a data structure that stores messages in \"*first-in-first-out*\" (*FIFO*) order. Messages are added to the back of the queue and removed from the front. Messages can be sent asynchronously and processed by the receiving component later, allowing for easy communication between different parts of a system.\n\n---\n\n## Getting the solution\n\nTo use the Send messages to a queue solution provided by **Azion Marketplace**, follow these steps:\n\n1. Access [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com) and log in.\n    - If you don’t have one yet, create an account by visiting the [sign-up page](https://sso.azion.com/).\n2. On the upper-left corner of the page, select **Products menu** > **Marketplace**.\n3. On the Marketplace’s homepage, type \"*message*\" in the search box or browse through the cards below it to find the desired Send messages to a queue solution.\n4. Select the Send messages to a queue card and you'll be redirected to the solution's page.\n5. Find the **Subscribe for** section at the bottom-right corner of the page.\n6. Click the **Get It Now** button.\n\nDone. You've installed the solution.\n\n> Note that a successful message appears on the top of the solution's page.\n\n---\n\n## Using the solution\n\nOnce you've gotten your solution on **Marketplace**, it'll be available at your **Edge Functions** list. You'll have to select an **Edge Application** to use the solution.\n\nFor this task you have several modes of action. The main ones are:\n\n- Visit the [getting started documentation](/en/documentation/products/getting-started/) to create a new edge application. \n- Create an edge application in **RTM** by selecting **Products menu** > **Edge Application** and follow the instructions.\n- Use an existing edge application.\n\n---\n\n## Configuring the solution\n\nOn the **Edge Application** page, locate the edge application you want to use with the new Send messages to a queue solution and select it.\n\nOn the **Main Settings** tab, locate the **Edge Functions** switch. This switch should be on the off position, you must turn it on:\n\n1. Activate the switch.\n2. On the bottom-right corner, click the **Save** button.\n\n> A successful message appears informing that the edge application is updated.\n\nThis will enable the **Functions** tab on your edge application, enabling you to instantiate the Send messages to a queue edge function on your edge application.\n\n---\n\n## Instantiating the solution\n\nTo enable the Send messages to a queue function, follow these steps:\n\n1. Still in the **Edge Application** page, select the **Functions** tab located in the top list.\n2. Click the **Add Function** button.\n3. On the Edge Function’s name text box, type an easy to remember name.\n4. On the dropdown function menu, select the **Send messages to a queue function**.\n\nThis action will load the function, showing a form with the source code of the function and, just above it, two tabs: **Code** and **Args**. By clicking the **Code** tab, you'll be able to navigate through the code but won't be able to change it.\n\nYou can configure three messaging services for this solution: *RabbitMQ*, *Amazon SQS*, and *Kafka-REST*. You can configure it in advance beforehand. For each one of these solutions, you'll have a different **Args** box and different credentials, as in the following examples:\n\n### AMQP:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"server_type\": \"amqp\",\n  \"connection_url\": \"https://my-service.azion.com/queue\",\n  \"connection_authorization\": \"Basic my_basic_auth\",\n  \"connection_args: {\t\n   \"routing_key: \"my_queue\",\n   \"payload: \"my_custom_payload\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### SQS\n\n```json\n{\n  \"server_type\": \"sqs\",\n  \"connection_url\": \"https://my-service.azion.com/sqs-queue\",\n  \"connection_authorization\": \"Basic my_basic_auth\",\n  \"connection_args: {\n    \"auth_params: \"my_aditional_auth_params\",\n     \"version\": \"2012-11-05\",\n    \"expires\": \"Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Kafka-REST\n\n```json\n{\n  \"server_type\": \"kafka-rest\",\n  \"connection_url\": \"https://my-service.azion.com/topics/my-topic\",\n \"connection_args: {\n    \"payload\": \"my_custom_payload\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Where**:\n- `server_type`: defines the connection type used (`amqp`, `sqs`, `kafka-rest` are the three possible values).\n- `connection_url`: defines the server URL of the service you choose.\n- `connection_authorization`: the type of authorization needed for the connection. This is an *optional* field.\n\nYou can also set extra parameters to your queue, passing them in the `connection_args` section. Each supported service has different extra parameters to use. It's *optional* to inform these to push your function to the edge.\n\n> **Important**: it isn't possible to integrate Kafka \"as is\" because the Kafka clients available for JavaScript (Kafka JS and Kafka Node) use Node.js features that are incompatible with **Azion Cells**. However, you have the option to integrate it using Kafka-REST, a module that provides an HTTP RESTful interface to a Kafka cluster.\n\nTo end the process, click the **Save** button. Now your function is configured.\n\n---\n\n## Configuring a rule on Rules Engine\n\nStill in the **Edge Application** page, in the **Rules Engine** tab, you have to configure the rules you want (*criteria* and *behavior*) to apply to run your function.\n\nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n1.

    "body": "\n**Signed Cookies** is a *serverless* solution, divided in two parts, available at Azion Marketplace.\n\nSigned cookies are a type of cookie that has an extra layer of security. Cookies that are signed have the information within them encrypted and can only be read by the website that created them. Signed cookies are often used for authentication purposes; for example, to remember if a user has logged in to a website. This allows the website to verify whether third parties have interfered with or altered the session data. This is an effective defense against session hijacking and other security attacks.\n\nSigned cookies can include a timestamp or expiration date in addition to encryption. This ensures that the data is only valid for a limited time. All in all, signed cookies are a vital tool for web developers to maintain security and integrity of user data.\n\n---\n\n## Getting the solution\n\nRemember: this solution is, in fact, two. The Signed Cookies solution is divided into the hash generator and the hash validator.\n\nTo install the solution, follow these steps:\n\n1. Log in to your [Real-Time Manager (RTM) account](https://manager.azion.com/).\n    - If you don’t have an account, you can [create one here](https://sso.azion.com/).\n2. On the upper-left corner of the page, select **Products menu** > **Marketplace**.\n3. Select the search box and type “*signed cookies*” or browse through the cards to find the two Signed Cookies solutions.\n3. Once you’ve found the *Signed Cookies - Hash Generator* and *Signed Cookies - Hash Validator* cards, select one to go to the solution page.\n4. On the solution page, look for the **Subscribe for** section on the bottom-right corner.\n5. Click the **Get It Now** button.\n\nYou'll follow the same steps to install the second solution, the Signed Cookies, only changing the name of the solution.\n\n> In both cases, after clicking on the **Get it now** button, you’ll see a message indicating that your solution was successfully installed and is ready to use.\n\n---\n\n## Using the solution\n\nThe solution obtained from the Azion Marketplace is added to your list of **Edge Functions**. Therefore, to use the Signed Cookies solution, you must create a new edge application to incorporate the new function.\n\nFor this task you have several modes of action, the main ones are:\n\n- Visit the [starting point documentation](/en/documentation/products/getting-started/). \n- Create an edge application on **RTM** by selecting **Products menu** > **Edge Application** and following the instructions.\n- Use an existing edge application.\n\n---\n\n## Configuring the solution\n\nTo configure your solution, proceed as follows:\n\n1. On the upper-left corner, select **Products menu** > **Edge Application** on the **BUILD** section.\n2. On the listing page of your edge applications, select the one you’ve created to use with the Signed Cookies solution.\n3. On the **Main Settings** tab, under **Modules**, locate the **Edge Functions** switch and turn it on to enable **Functions** on your edge application.\n4. Still under the **Modules** section, locate the **Application Acceleration** switch and turn it on to enable the **Forward Cookies** functionality for your application (this will be addressed at the [Rules Engine section](#rules-engine).\n4. Click the **Save** button.\n\n> You’ll receive a successful message indicating your edge application was updated.\n\n---\n\n## Instantiating the solution\n\nTo enable this function, while still on the **Edge Application** page:\n\n1. Select the **Functions** tab on the top list.\n2. Click the **Add Function** button.\n3. Choose an easy to remember name for your function.\n4. On the dropdown function menu, select the **Signed Cookies** function.\n\nThis action will load the function, showing a form with the function's source code and, just above it, two tabs: **Code** and **Args**. By clicking the **Code** tab you will be able to navigate through the code but won't be able to change it.\n\n> As you have two solutions, you'll have to configure two **Args** tabs, one for the response phase and another one for the request phase.\n\n> Remember that the **Hash Generator has to run on the response phase**, and the **Hash Validator has to run on the request phase**.\n\nFor the **Hash Generator**, the parameters are:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"cookie_list\": [\"yummy_cookie\", \"tasty_cookie\"],\n  \"cookie_secret\": \"ItIsASecret\",\n  \"tampering_cookie_prefix\": \"tampering_protection\"\n}\n```\n\n**Where**:\n- `cookie_list`: defines the list of cookies that should be protected. For each cookie in this list, an encrypted version of the cookie will be appended to the response.\n- `cookie_secret`: a secret to protect the encrypted cookie against client-side manipulation.\n- `tampering_cookie_prefix`: defines the prefix to be used in the name of the encrypted cookies.\n\nYou should pay attention to the possible values added to the `tampering_cookie_prefix`. \n\nFor example, if the value of this argument is `tampering_protection` and we protect the cookies `yummy_cookie` and `tasty_cookie`,the encrypted cookies created by the function will be named `tampering_protection_yummy_cookie` and `tampering_protection_tasty_cookie`.\n\nIf this argument doesn't have a valid value, then the default value `azion_tampering` is used. Therefore, in this case, the encrypted cookies would be `azion_tampering_yummy_cookie` and `azion_tampering_tasty_cookie`.\n\nFor the **Hash Validator**, the parameters are:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"cookie_list\": [\"yummy_cookie\", \"tasty_cookie\"],\n  \"cookie_secret\": \"ItIsASecret\",\n  \"tampering_cookie_prefix\": \"tampering_protection\",\n  \"tampering_violation_header_prefix\": \"azion-tampering-violation\"\n}\n```\n\nThese are the same fields of the Signed Cookies - Hash Generator, with the addition of one more field, `tampering_violation_header_prefix`. It defines a prefix to the headers which the function will append to the request whenever a cookie violation is identified.\n\nYou should pay attention to the possible values added to `tampering_violation_header_prefix`. \n\nFor example, the `Cookie-Violation-Any`, `Cookie-Violation-Counter`, and `Cookie-Violation-List` headers will be created if the value of this argument is `Cookie-Violation`.\n\nIf this argument doesn't have valid data, the defaults are `Azion-Tampering-Violation-Any`, `Azion-Tampering-Violation-Counter`, and `Azion-Tampering-Violation-List`.\n\n---\n\n## Configuring a rule on Rules Engine\n\nStill in the **Edge Application** page, in the **Rules Engine** tab, you have to configure the rules you want (*criteria* and *behavior*) to apply to run your function.\n\nFirst, you have to configure the **response phase** for the **Rules Engine**. To do so, follow these steps:\n\n1. Select the **Rules Engine** tab.\n2. Click the **New Rule** button and select **Response Phase**.\n3. Give an easy to remember name to your rule.\n4. Pass the *criteria* you need to in order to run your solution.\n5. On the *behavior* field, select **Run Function** from the dropdown menu and then select the **Signed Cookies - Hash Generator** function, according to the name you gave it in the instantiation step.\n6. Click the **Save** button.\n\nNow, you have to configure the **request phase** for the **Rules Engine**. To do so, follow these steps:\n\n1. Select the **Rules Engine** tab.\n2. Click the **New Rule** button and select **Request Phase**.\n3. Give an easy to remember name to your rule.\n4. Pass the *criteria* you need to in order to run your solution.\n5. On the *behavior* field, select **Run Function** from the dropdown menu and then select the **Signed Cookies - Hash Validator** function, according to the name you gave it in the instantiation step.\n    - You'll also need a *second behavior* for the **Signed Cookies - Hash Validator** function: **Forward Cookies**. \n6. To add it, click the **+** button and select the **Forward Cookies** option from the dropdown menu.\n7. Click the **Save** button.\n\nDone. You've successfully instantiated your two solutions and now you're protected against attackers.\n",

You can configure your edge application to mitigate HTTPOxy using [Rules Engine](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/rules-engine/).\n\n---\n\n## About HTTPoxy\n\nHTTPoxy can affect web applications that use *Common Gateway Interface (CGI)* or CGI-like environments. CGI is the method responsible for handling user requests and establishing a line of communication between the client and the server through environment variables.\n\nThe `Proxy` header in HTTP requests was found to be vulnerable to malicious requests in CGI environments. When a `Proxy` value is sent to the server by a request header, that value overwrites the `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable used to configure outgoing proxies. This means that any internal request generated by the client can be redirected to an external proxy server, and all data contained within the request can be captured.\n\n> For more information about this vulnerability, visit the official [HTTPoxy website](https://httpoxy.org/) or the [CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC) vulnerability database](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/797896).\n\n---\n\n## Creating a rule to block the HTTP Proxy header\n\nIn order to protect your applications against HTTPoxy, follow the steps below to block the `Proxy` header during the Request Phase.\n\n1. [Access Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com).\n2. On the upper-left corner of the page, go to **Products menu** > **Edge Application**.\n3. Select the application you want to configure against HTTPoxy attacks.\n4. On the **Main Settings** tab, in the **Modules** section, enable **Application Acceleration**.\n5. Click the **Save** button to save this setting.\n6. In the **Rules Engine** tab, click the **New Rule** button and select **Request Phase**.\n7. Add a name to your rule.\n8. In the **Criteria** section, add a criteria.\n\n    > You can create a default rule to mitigate your application as a whole as follows:\n    >\n    > If `${uri}` starts with `/`\n\n9. Then, in the **Behaviors** section, select the **Filter Request Header** behavior and add `proxy` as an argument.\n10. Click the **Save** button.\n\nOnce the variable is set, if a malicious request is made to your application containing the `Proxy` header, your edge application will strip the header, protecting your origin from HTTPoxy attacks.\n",

    "slug": "en/pages/guides/mtls",
    "body": "\n**Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS)** is an encryption protocol based on *Transport Layer Security (TLS)*, which validates the digital certificate on both ends of a request.\n\nTo configure mTLS in your applications, you need to activate the service through our [Sales Channel](https://www.azion.com/en/contact-sales/) in addition to having a digital certificate with mTLS support, provided by a third-party certificate authority. At Azion, we call this certificate **Trusted Certificate (Trusted CA)**.\n\nMore information about requirements, digital certificates, Trusted CA, and how mTLS works at Azion is available on the [Support for mTLS page](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/domains/mtls/).\n\n## Add a Trusted CA to your Digital Certificates library\n\nWith your **Trusted CA** created, you need to add it to your library of *Digital Certificates*, under **Edge Libraries**:\n\n1. Go to the [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com) and click on the **Products Menu**, indicated by the ☰ icon. Search for the **Edge Libraries** category and click on **Digital Certificates**.\n2. Click the *Add certificate* button and select the *Trusted CA Certificate* option from the *dropdown* menu.\n4. On the new certificate registration page, set an identifying name for this certificate in the *\"Digital Certificate Name\"* field.\n5. Enter in *Certificate* the content that represents your **Trusted CA**.\n    > Remember that the certificate file must be of `.pem` format – Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM). Example: `certificate.pem`.\n6. Click the *Save* button to proceed.\n\nYou'll be redirected to the **Digital Certificates** page, where all your certificates are listed, including this newly added one.\n\n## Choose the domains\n\nAfter adding a **Trusted CA** to your certificate library, you need to configure which domains should operate with mTLS.\n\n1. Go to the **Domains** page, found in the **Products Menu (☰)**.\n2. Click on the domain you would like to configure **mTLS** for.\n4. Enable the *Enable Mutual Authentication (mTLS)* switch.\n5. Choose which verification mode you wish to use. It can be `Enforce` and `Permissive`.\n6. Select the **Trusted CA Certificate**, added in the previous step, from the *dropdown* menu.\n7. Click the *Save* button to proceed.\n\nBy selecting `Enforce` verification (default), mTLS is enabled in your **Edge Application** and all incoming traffic will comply with client and server authentication. \n\nHowever, if you're looking to test or access your application from specific conditions, choose the `Permissive` mode. The `Permissive` mode is set up through the **Rules Engine** of the **Edge Firewall** and the steps are described in the section below.\n\n> It is important to remember that misconfiguring the `Permissive` verification mode can result in security incidents.\n\n## Adding specific rules for using Permissive mTLS\n\nTo configure the operation of `Permissive` mode: \n\n1. Go to the **Products Menu (☰)**.\n2. In the SECURE category, click **Edge Firewall**.\n3. If there's no Firewall configured, click *Add Rule Set* and set an identification name for the new rules.\n4. Under *Domain Settings*, select your application domain and click the `>` button to send the chosen domain to *Chosen Domains*.\n5. Click *Save*.\n6. With the *Rule Set* created, click the **Rules Engine** tab of the **Edge Firewall**.\n7. Click the *New Rule* button.\n8. Choose an identifying name for this rule in *Rule Name*.\n9. Define the *Criteria* and *Behaviors* specific to your need.\n    > For this example, the logic will be: `Criteria: If: Hostname is equal to {yourDomain.com} + And Client Certificate Validation is not equal to true. Behaviors: Then Deny (403 Forbidden)`.\n10. Make sure that the *Active switch* is activated.\n11. Click the *Save* button.\n\nWithout mTLS support enabled in your Azion account, the Criteria option *Client Certificate Validation* will not appear.\n\n> In this example logic, the *Rule Set* created will block (Error 403 Forbidden) any incoming network traffic with a *hostname* equal to `yourDomain.com` whose client certificate validation is not true.\n\n## Specifying mTLS variables in the application header\n\nIf your application is part of the Open Banking model, you will need to specify the variables `${ssl_client_escaped_cert}` and `${ssl_client_s_dn_parsed}` in the *header* of your application. You can also insert other mTLS variables. [Check the list of available variables and their descriptions](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/rules-engine/).\n\nTo add a variable to your application header, follow the steps:\n\n1. Within the **RTM**, open the **Products Menu (☰)**.\n2. Click on **Edge Application**.\n3. Find and click on the application with mTLS enabled.\n4. Within the settings of your **Edge Application**, click the *Rules Engine* tab.\n5. Click the *New Rule* button and select *Request Phase*.\n6. Set an identifier name for this *Rule*.\n7. In the *Criteria* field, change the operator `is equal` to `exists`.\n8. In the *Behaviors* field, select the *Add Request Header* option and add the variable you wish to insert in your application's header.\n    > **Tip:** The use of the prefix `X-` in the `header-name` of custom HTTP variables is discouraged by the HTTP development organization, Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), since 2012 ([RFC 6648](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc6648/)). The IETF recommends using a simple `header-name`, which indicates the actual use of the variable, but which does not conflict with standard variables.\n9. Make sure the **Active** switch is on.\n10. To add another variable, click the `+` button and return to step 7.\n11. Click the **Save** button.\n\nOne way to test these header variables is with the [curl](https://curl.se/) tool. From a directory containing your **Trusted CA** and its key in a `.pem` file (for example, `cert.pem` and `key.pem`), open the terminal and run `curl -skv https://<yourDomain.com>/ -H \"pragma:azion-debug-cache\" -o /dev/stdout --cert cert.pem --key key.pem`. You should find `header-name:value` from the added variables on the terminal response.\n",

    "body": "\nThe JWT edge function is a *serverless* solution of Azion Marketplace for processing and validating JWT (*JSON Web Token*) tokens. It can be used to create paywall solutions that allow you to control access to content by subscription.\n\nWith this system, the application optimizes operations and reduces the processing load on the client's infrastructure by identifying directly at the edge whether the person attempting to access a particular page is authorized or not. \n\nSome other benefits of JWT solution are:\n\n1. Provides application development flexibility to the client.\n2. Processes the tokens in a distributed infrastructure of edge nodes.\n3. Gives the ability for business rules execution at the edge.\n\n---\n\n## How the JWT solution works\n\nIn a JWT paywall implementation, the origin application and the function on edge have different roles:\n\n**Originating Application**: this determines the logic around how the token is generated and when it'll expire. It also determines how user access is controlled, such as which authentication method is used (OAUTH, OpenID Connect, etc.), the number of access attempts or bytes the customer can use before being prompted to log in, or the amount of time the customer can browse without further authorization (expiration).\n\nThe token uses an industry standard for HTTP authentication, the **Bearer Authentication Scheme**, which stores `JSON` objects with request authentication information that must be added to the header of every request passing through edge.\n\n**Edge Function JWT**: validates the application-generated token for each request received and sent by the user. The function follows the business rules defined in the token and can combine these with other elements on the edge to define what behavior should be applied (allowing access or redirecting to the application, usually a logon/sign-in page).\n\n---\n\n## Configuring the JWT function\n\nThe edge function JWT is available in Azion Marketplace. You can access Azion Matketplace by [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/), on the **Products menu** on the upper-left corner, represented by three horizontal lines.\n\nTo be executed, the function must be instantiated in the **Edge Application**. Its activation *criteria* and *behavior* must also be defined within the **Rules Engine** in accordance with the approach already configured in the source application (for example, proprietary versions of OAuth, OpenID, etc., or market versions such as Auth0, Keycloak, etc.).\n\n---\n\n## Creating an Instance\n\nTo create a JWT function, you can refer to the guide on [How to install the JWT solution from Azion Marketplace](/en/documentation/products/guides/jwt/)\n\n**Parameters**: once you've selected the JWT function on you edge application a form with the source code will appear in the **Code** field. It's just for information, you can't change it. On the **Args** tab, you'll pass the list of KID pairs (*key IDs*) and secret keys used to generate the signature of the token and save the function. \n\nThe list of pairs is defined in its source application, as in the example below:\n\n``` json\n[{\n\t\"kids\": {\n    \t\"4546D4AA7F62F01A833A7ABE354030E7\": \"D6CB2342E44EFB6DD628276F36DA2359\",\n    \t\"D6CB2342E44EFB6DD628276F36DA2359\": \"60BD8ED7A768E8BD6925BEB0A691AADB\",\n    \t\"60BD8ED7A768E8BD6925BEB0A691AADB\": \"4546D4AA7F62F01A833A7ABE354030E7\"\n  \t}\n}]\n```\n\n---\n\n## Defining the rule on Rules Engine\n\nThe rules on **Rules Engine** will determine the set of conditions that need to be met for *behaviors* to be executed. You can either use the **Default Rule** or create a new rule.\n\n### Defining the validation criteria \n\nChoose the variables, comparison operators, and strings to create your business rule, as in the following example:\n\n`If: ${uri} starts with /news`\n\n> Logic: logical operator, variable, comparison operator, string.\n\nHere, the rule is executed if a URL starts with the string `/news`.\n\n### Defining the behaviors \n\nAdd the *behaviors* you want to be carried out when the rule's conditions are met. Example:\n\n`Then Run Function` and chose **JWT** (or any other name you gave it).\n\n> Logic: logical operator, action, function.\n\nIn this example, if the conditions defined in the rules are satisfied, then the **JWT** function will be executed.\n\n> **Note**: an error code will be returned if the token received is invalid. The function will return an HTTP status code 400 or 401, depending on the error. \n\nFinally, save your edge application and the new function will be ready. \n",

    "slug": "en/pages/guides/run-the-dig-command",
    "body": "\n**Dig** or **dig command** is a command-line tool for querying domain information on Domain Name System (DNS) servers. Originally called *Domain Information Groper*, the command is part of BIND, a group of networking tools maintained by the Internet Systems Consortium (ISC).\n\nThe `dig` command is commonly used for network and domain troubleshooting, and also other DNS operations. It's also a multiplatform and an alternative to the discontinued `nslookup`.\n\nIn this guide, you'll query records from a specific domain and from several domains in the same request; select which DNS server to use for the query; find out the latency (in milliseconds); what are the IPs associated with the domains queried; and track the entire process of resolving nameservers, from the root to the last authoritative nameserver (which maintains the domain records).\n\n---\n\n## Installing the dig command\n\nBy default, the dig command is installed on most versions of macOS and some Linux distributions, but it isn't installed on Windows and most Linux distributions.\n\n### Installing dig on Windows\n\n1. Download the Current-Stable, ESV version of BIND from [the ISC downloads page](https://www.isc.org/download/).\n2. Extract the entire contents of the compressed file `BIND9.18.14.tar.xz` into a dedicated folder.\n3. Run the `BINDInstall.exe` file as an administrator.\n4. Select the **Tools Only** checkbox to install only the `dig`, `host`, `nslookup`, and `nsupdatetools`.\n\n> You can still use BIND with Windows. However, support for OS was removed in a [2021 update](https://www.isc.org/blogs/bind-update-summer2021/).\n\n### Installing dig on Linux distributions\n\nTo install the command on Debian-based distributions such as Ubuntu, PopOS, and Kali Linux:\n\n1. Open the terminal.\n2. Run `sudo apt-get install dnsutils`.\n   > For other Linux distributions, see the developer documentation.\n3. Run `dig -v` to check the installed version.\n\n---\n\n## Using the dig command\n\nTo perform a query with the `dig` command:\n\n1. Open the terminal (Command Line Prompt, Power Shell, or Git Bash for Windows systems).\n2. Run `dig azion.com` (swap `azion.com` for the domain you want to query).\n\nIt's also possible to perform a query of several domains in the same request:\n\n1. Create a text file to store the domains of interest. Example: `domains.txt`.\n2. Inside the file, separate the domains by line. Example:\n\n   ```\n   azion.com\n   google.com\n   github.com\n   ```\n\n3. Open the terminal.\n4. Run `dig domains.txt`.\n\nThe answer to these commands consists of four sections: **Header**, **OPT PSEUDOSECTION**, **ANSWER SECTION**, and **footer**.\n\nThere's relevant information in all sections of the response. However, this guide will focus on the last two sections: **ANSWER SECTION** and **footer**.\n\nThe **ANSWER SECTION** is where the DNS records should appear. In the **footer** section, you find the latency time, in milliseconds, in addition to which DNS server was used to solve the request.\n\nBy default, the `dig` command uses a list of DNS servers stored locally on your machine.\n\nIf you want to use a specific DNS list, such as Google's (`8.8.8.8`, `8.8.4.4`, `2001:4860::4860::8888`, and `2001:4860:4860::8844`), for example, use the `@` + IP tag in the list.\n\nHere's an example of the command:\n\n`dig @8.8.8.8 azion.com` or `dig @8.8.8.8 domains.txt`\n\nTo track the entire DNS server path, add the `+trace` option to the command. See an example:\n\n`dig azion.com +trace`\n\nThe `+trace` option is an instruction to return the full path that the DNS server took to resolve the query.\n\nThis response is quite different from the simple request and presents all DNS servers involved in the resolution of a domain, passing through the Top-Level Domain (TLD) servers until reaching the last authoritative server.\n\nChecking the latency of a web application with the dig command is one of the ways of validating Azion's Edge Computing service. For example, you can compare the latency of your application, served by cloud and by Azion Edge Computing platform.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/X2Ei0zrZxxk\" title=\"Looking up DNS servers with Dig command YouTube video\" loading=\"lazy\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n",

A seller can be an independent software vendor (ISV), value-added reseller, or individual who has something to offer that works with Azion products and services.\n\nEvery software product on the Azion Marketplace has been through a curation process. On the Product page, there can be one or more offerings for the product. When the seller submits a product in Azion Marketplace, they define the price of the product and the terms and conditions of use. When a consumer subscribes to a product offering, they agree to the pricing and terms and conditions set for the offer.\n\nThe product can be free to use or it can have an associated charge. The charge becomes part of the customer's bill, and after payment, Azion Marketplace pays the seller. Products can take many forms. For example, a product can be offered as an *Azion Cells Package (ACP)* that is instantiated using your Azion account. The product can also be an Azion Edge Function, or a template with a preset of rules for any Azion product.\n\nSoftware products can be purchased at the listed price using the ISV’s standard end user license agreement (EULA) or offered with customer pricing and EULA. Products can also be purchased under a Saving Plan with specified time or usage boundaries. \n\nOnce the product subscriptions are in place, the customer can copy the product to their *Azion Edge Libraries* to manage how the product is accessed and used in the customer's organization.\n\n## Sign up with Azion Marketplace\n\nAzion Marketplace is built for independent software vendors (ISV), value-added resellers, or individuals who have something to offer that works with Azion products and services.\n\nTo be eligible to list your product with an associated charge you must be able to receive payments from Azion, therefore meet the following requirements:\n\n* Your organization must be incorporated in the USA.\n* Your organization must have a USA-based bank account.\n\n## Preparing Your Product\n\nYou prepare your product for publication on Azion Marketplace by configuring your package, setting a pricing scheme (if any), determining what categories your product should show under.\n\nYou can build and run your software entirely on the *Azion Edge Platform* using an Azion Cells Package (ACP)-based model, or decide to run it partially on Azion by using a Software as a Service (SaaS)-based model, where users access your own control panel to make changes to the service. Your products are sold and billed through Azion Marketplace, except if the customer chose a BYOL subscription model.\n\nTo offer your product on Azion Marketplace and charge customers through Azion, your development team must integrate it with the Azion platform and Azion Marketplace Metering Service, so that users can deploy your product with minimal effort.\n\nYou can create products with a standard price list and end user license agreement (EULA), and can create private offers for individual customers with special pricing and EULAs - usually needed by large enterprises or RFPs.\n\n### Product Pricing\n\nYour product can be offered in three different models: a Subscription-Based model, a Bring Your Own License (BYOL) model and a  Software free of charge model.\n\nThe following is general pricing information about products in Azion Marketplace. All pricing is based on US dollars (USD).\n\n* There is no service fee for Bring Your Own License (BYOL) or  Software free of charge products on Azion Marketplace.\n* To deliver on our customer promise of selection, we require that all BYOL products also have a paid option. This is so that customers who don’t have existing licenses have the option to purchase and use the products.\n\t* For BYOL products, we realize that the online purchase of software is a departure from how some companies do business. In light of this, for the first 90 days after launch we will relax the requirement that this software is accompanied by a version available for purchase on the Azion Marketplace. During this time, the Azion Marketplace account management teams will work with you to address challenges and to determine if and how the software can be made available for purchase on the Azion Marketplace.\n* For Paid products, the seller defines the charges for using the software and Azion Marketplace collects software charges from the customer.\n* All seller's products will incur associated Azion charges depending on the services used. These rates and fees are defined and controlled by Azion. They are displayed separately on the Azion Marketplace detail pages to help customers understand the potential cost of using the products.\n\n#### A. Software free of charge\n\n Software free of charge solutions let you run software on Azion Edge Platform while using licenses free of charge. Azion will charge customers for the Azion services costs, including with usage Software free of charge.\n\n#### B. Bring Your Own License\n\nAvailable for customers with current licenses purchased via other channels.\n\nBYOL (Bring Your Own License) solutions let you run software on Azion Edge Platform while using licenses purchased directly from the seller. Azion only charges customers for the Azion services costs, giving them the flexibility to purchase and manage their own licenses.\n\n#### C. Software Subscription\n\nWith the Software Subscription model you will use Azion Marketplace to charge for the usage of your product. You can choose between two different options, Pay As You Go (PAYG) or Saving Plans.\n\n**Pay As You Go**\n\nIn a Pay As You Go model Azion Marketplace bills your customers based on the metering records of usage of your software and the price for that usage, established by you. It is a model with no commitment and the usage is calculated and billed monthly.\n\nFor ACP-based products, Azion Marketplace will bill your customer based on the metering records available in the Azion Edge Platform. The available metering records are:\n\n* Number of deployed instances\n* Number of registered users\n* Requests\n* Compute Time\n* Data Transfer\n\nFor SaaS-based products, Azion Marketplace bills your customers based on the metering reported by your SaaS applying the price list established by you.\n\nThe Azion Marketplace Metering Service requires that your software report usage every hour, recording the customer usage for the hour. If there is a failure in the transmission or receipt of metering service records, Azion will be unable to bill for such usage. You are responsible for ensuring the successful receipt of metering records.\n\nYou can use any metering records that suit your SaaS business model, regarding that you have established the price list for it and your SaaS reports the usage correctly.\n\nCustomers can use your product in a free trial for a fixed period of time in this pricing model. At the end of a free trial, customers will be auto-enrolled in the PAYG model, unless he or she cancels or opt-out previously.\n\n**Saving Plans**\n\nIn a Saving Plan model the customer initiates a purchase of your software, built as an ACP or a SaaS-based product, and enters into an agreement with you. Under the agreement, the customer is entitled to a specified quantity of use of your SaaS product.\n\nIn case of overage usage by the customers, they will pay for the pay-as-you-go price.\n\nAzion Marketplace can bill your customers upfront or by the payment schedule that you define, based on the Saving Plan between you and your customer. After that point, the customers are entitled to use your software.\n\nFor example, a customer might purchase a quantity of requests to your SaaS for a 1-month time period or for 1-year, 2-year, or 3-year time periods. For additional usage above their Saving Plans, Azion Marketplace bills your customers based on the pay-as-you-go price established by you.\n\nThe customer can initiate negotiation of the product pricing with you within a private offer. You will negotiate pricing and usage privately with the customer, and the negotiated terms start as soon as the customer accepts the deal.\n\n## Azion Marketplace Tiered Listing Fees\n\nListing Fees for Your Marketplace Content will be calculated on a tiered basis (“Tiered Listing Fee” or “TLF”), as determined by the value of a subscription to a product. TLF adjustments apply to all product types regardless of the deployment method. The value of each Transaction is calculated based on the dollar value of the payment being made by the subscriber of Your Marketplace Content. If the subscriber is paying for a product metered by the Azion Marketplace Metering Service, then the Transaction value will be the amount billed to the customer each month. Reductions to the Tiered Listing Fee based on increases in Transaction value will be applied on a month-by-month basis, and will not be retroactive. \n\n### A. SaaS-based Products\n\nFor SaaS-based products purchased in Azion Marketplace, the TLF calculation of the Listing Fee is based on the value and duration of the subscription. Table 1 outlines the Tiered Listing Fees that Azion Marketplace will charge for SaaS-deployed product Transactions based on the duration and dollar value of each Transaction:\n\n*Table 1 (Tiered Listing Fees for SaaS products):*\n\n| Tier | SaaS TLF Tiers              | Monthly and Annual | Year 2 | Year 3 |\n| :--- | --------------------------- | ------------------ | ------ | ------ |\n| 1    | Subscriptions under $20,000 | 13%                | 12%    | 11%    |\n| 2    | \\$20,001 - $99,999          | 11%                | 10%    | 9%     |\n| 3    | \\$100,000 \\- $999,999       | 10%                | 9%     | 8%     |\n| 4    | $1,000,000+                 | 9%                 | 7%     | 6%     |\n\n>  The dollar value tiers in the table above are calculated as follows: (i) for metered subscriptions and monthly Saving Plans the value is the amount paid by the customer each month and (ii) for annual or multi-year subscriptions the value for the entire duration of the subscription is based on the amount paid upfront by the customer at the time the customer enters into the Transaction.\n\nMetered subscriptions, monthly Saving Plans and 1-year Saving Plans will receive the “Monthly and Annual” Tiered Listing Fee until the beginning of the second year, at which point the Tiered Listing Fee will drop to the “Year 2” value (and so on to Year 3). Multi-year purchases that are either billed up front, or on a set schedule, will receive the Listing Fee applicable to the last year of the subscription for the entire Transaction.\n\nFor example, if a customer is subscribed to a SaaS product, and pays \\$19,000 per month for a metered subscription, the Listing Fee will be 13% for each monthly transaction (Tier 1, Monthly rate). In month 11, the customer increases their usage and is billed \\$21,000, so the Listing Fee drops to 11% (Tier 2, Monthly rate). In month 13, the customer has maintained their usage and is billed ​\\$21000, but because the subscription has entered year 2, the Listing Fee drops to 10% (Tier 2, Year 2 rate). In month 14, the customer decreases their usage to $19,000, and the Listing Fee increases to 12% (Tier 1, Year 2 rate).\n\n### B. ACP-based Product \n\nFor Software running entirely on the Azion Edge Platform, the TLF calculation of the Listing Fee is based on the value of the subscription. Table 2 outlines the Tiered Listing Fees that Azion Marketplace will charge, based on the dollar value of each Transaction:\n\n*Table 2 (Tiered Listing Fees for software products):*\n\n| Tier | Software TLF Tiers   | Listing Fee Per Tier |\n| ---- | -------------------- | -------------------- |\n| 1    | Below $20,000        | 20%                  |\n| 2    | \\$20,001 - $99,999   | 17%                  |\n| 3    | \\$100,000 - $249,999 | 15%                  |\n| 4    | $250,000+            | 13%                  |\n\n>  For example, if a customer is billed \\$19,000 for use of software in 1-month, the listing fee will be 20% for that transaction (Tier 1). If in month two the customer increases usage of your software and is billed $21,000, the Listing Fee will drop to 17% for that Transaction (Tier 2).\n",

    "body": "\n**Azion Marketplace** is a digital catalog that makes it easy to find, test, and deploy edge-enabled software that runs anywhere. With a wide range of solutions, you can use it to enhance, compose, or customize your applications. In addition, it provides a channel for Independent Software Vendors (ISVs), software developers, and open source communities to distribute edge-enabled software to an audience of thousands of active buyers.\n\nWorking as a digital catalog, Azion's Marketplace allows developers to implement a solution that meets their requirements, providing resources that can be used both within and outside of the [Azion Edge Network](https://www.azion.com/en/products/edge-network). \n\nAt Azion's Marketplace, you find solutions to launch in your edge resources, such as [Edge Firewall](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/) or [Edge Application](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/), in Security, Performance, Database, and AI Solutions.\n\n---\n\n## First steps\n\nTo access **Marketplace**, proceed as follows:\n\n1. [Create an Azion account](/en/documentation/products/accounts/creating-account/).\n2. Log in to [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).\n3. On the upper-left corner, select the three horizontal lines to open the **Products menu**.\n4. Select **Marketplace**.\n\nNow, you can navigate through all the solutions available or filter them.\n\n---\n\n## Getting a solution\n\nTo install any solution provided by Azion's Marketplace, follow these steps:\n\n1. On the upper-left corner of the page, select **Products menu** > **Marketplace**.\n2. On the Marketplace's homepage, you have two ways to search for a solution: \n    1. In the search box, type the whole name of the solution, or just a keyword or part of it. This will return any solution that matches with the text.\n    2. Browse through the cards below it to find the desired solution.\n3. Select the desired solution card to be redirected to the solution's page.\n4. On the **Subscribe for** section, at the bottom-right corner of the page, click the **Get It Now** button.\n\n> A successful message appears. Your solution is installed and ready to use.\n\n---\n\n## Using a solution\n\nAfter installing a solution in the **Marketplace** directory, it'll be available for usage in your account.\n\nEach solution has its purpose with specific features, and you'll find more information about it in the **Overview**, **Usage Information**, and **Support** tabs.\n\n> **Note**: a solution may have dependencies and require more actions. Visit the [Azion's guides page](/en/documentation/products/guides/#marketplace) to check the step-by-step process for each solution.\n\nSolutions require activation of the **Edge Functions** module. You must verify that it's enabled for your applications in **RTM** by selecting, on the upper-right corner, **Account menu** > **Billing & Subscriptions**.\n\nCurrently, you can use a Marketplace solution within an **Edge Application** or an **Edge Firewall**. Each of these options requires its own configuration, as it'll be explained below.\n\n---\n\n## Instantiating a solution to an edge application\n\n---\n\n### If you already have an edge application\n\nIf you already have an edge application, you can manually instantiate your solution for this edge application.\n\nTo do so, follow the steps:\n\n1. On the upper-left corner, select **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines.\n2. Select **Edge Application**, under the **BUILD** section, to load the edge applications list.\n3. From the edge applications list, select the edge application you want to instantiate your newly installed solution.\n4. Enable edge functions for your edge application by activating the **Functions** switch.\n5. Click the **Save** button.\n\n---\n\n### If you don't have an edge application yet\n\nIf you don't have an edge application yet, you have two ways to create one: manually and through the user journey on **RTM's** homepage.\n\nSee the steps for the two options below.\n\n#### Manually\n\nIf you don't have an edge application yet, you can create one manually by following the steps:\n\n1. On the **Products menu**, select **Edge Application** under the **BUILD** section.\n2. Click the button **Add Application**.\n3. Give an easy to remember name to your edge application.\n4. Select **Single Origin** at the **Origin Type** field.\n5. Provide an address on the **Address** field.\n6. Provide the `${host}` on the **Host Header** field.\n7. Click the **Save** button.\n\nTo use your new solution, you'll have to instantiate it on your edge application.\n\nTo do so, follow the steps:\n\n1. Select the newly created edge application from the list.\n2. In the **Main Settings** tab, enable the switch **Functions** to enable functions on your edge application.\n3. Click the **Save** button.\n\nStill on the edge application page, follow the steps to instantiate an solution:\n\n1. On the top list, select the **Functions** tab.\n2. Click the **Add Function** button.\n3. On the edge function's name text box, give an easy to remember name.\n4. On the dropdown function menu, select the function you've installed from **Marketplace**.\n\nThis will load the function, showing a box with the code of the functions and two tabs: **Code** and **Args**. Here, every solution has a different configuration. To be able to install your solution, go to the [guides section on Azion's documentation](/en/documentation/products/guides/#marketplace) and select the solution you want to use.\n\n> **Note**: some solutions will require more resources to run. For such cases, you can check [Azion's documentation guides](/en/documentation/products/guides/#marketplace) as well.\n\n#### Through the user journey\n\nTo use the user journey: \n\n1. Go to **RTM's** homepage.\n2. Select the **Build an edge application** card.\n3. Provide an easy to remember name to your edge application.\n4. Select the **Run a function** option.\n5. On the **Configure function** option, select the function you installed from Marketplace on the dropdown menu.\n6. A form with the source code of the solution will appear.\n- This tab called **Code** is just for study, you can't modify it. On the same form, you have an **Args** tab. In that tab you'll pass your configurations parameters, according to the solution you've installed.\n7. Click the **Next** button.\n\nDone. The **Lauch** screen will show you information about your edge application, such as the link to access it and the **Build Summary** with details of the building process.\n\n> You can read about the solutions' configurations on the [Azion's guides section](/en/documentation/products/guides/#marketplace).\n\n---\n\n## Instantiating an edge firewall solution\n\nThe process to instantiate an edge firewall solution is similar to the process of an edge application. However, it has some differences in the configuration locations.\n\nTo instantiate an edge firewall solution, follow these steps:\n\n1. Select **Products menu** > **Edge Firewall** in the **Secure** section.\n2. You can select any of your **Edge Firewall** applications or create a new one.\n    1. To create a new one, you have to click the **Add Rule Set** button.\n    2. Give it an easy to remember name to your solution.\n    3. Select the domains where the firewall will be active.\n    4. Enable edge functions for your edge firewall by clicking the **Functions** switch.\n    5. Click the **Save** button.\n3. Go to the **Functions** tab and click **Add Function** to add the function you've installed. You'll be redirected to the edge firewall page.\n5. Give an easy to remember name to your function.\n6. Select the function you've added through **Marketplace** in the **Edge Functions** dropdown list. A code box with two tabs, **Code** and **Args**, will load.\n- Every solution has a configuration. To find out how to configure your solution, go to [Azion's guides page](/en/documentation/products/guides/#marketplace).\n7. Go to the **Rules Engine** tab and create the rule to define the *criteria* for when to run your function and set the *behavior* for *run function* passing the function you've installed through Marketplace.\n\nDone. You're all set.\n\n---\n\n## Updating a version of your solution on Marketplace\n\nThe solutions presented within **Marketplace** aren’t static. Azion and Azion’s partners can update them when they launch new features. Thus, it's recommended that you always have the most updated solution, following the update schedule of Azion or ISVs.\n\nTo make sure that you're running the latest version of the solution acquired on Marketplace, follow the steps indicated below:\n\n1. On **RTM**, on the upper-left corner, select **Products menu** > **Marketplace**.\n2. Select the solution you want to update.\n3. Click on the **Get new version** button to download the solution's latest version.\n\nA message informing you the solution has been successfully updated will appear. Afterward, you can view all your solutions in your **Edge Functions** list.\n\n**Important**: when you update a solution in Marketplace, it won't overwrite the solution's version you're currently running on your edge application. This occurs to give you control over the version you want to use with your application. For instance, you could test a new version of a solution with a different edge application. So, when the new version has passed through your validation process, on your edge application, you can select it to run. To do so, change the solution version on the functions dropdown menu of your edge application.\n\n---\n\n## How-to guides\n\nEach solution may have different configurations and dependencies to be installed and for them to work adequately. To find out how to configure a specific solution and be able to install it successfully, go to the [Azion's guides page](/en/documentation/products/guides/#marketplace) and select the guide related to the solution you want to use.\n\n---\n\n## Permissions\n\nIn order to use Marketplace properly, some solutions will need permissions to execute repeated actions on your account. This happens because some solutions have semi-auto installations. To understand more about the permissions, you can visit the [Marketplace Permissions](/en/documentation/products/guides/permissions-mktp/) documentation page. \n\n---\n\n## Business models\n\nAzion Marketplace operates with the following business models:\n\n1. **Bring your own License (BYOL)**: bring the current ISV license or credentials and insert it in the Edge Function code component.\n2. **Free model**: launch the solution on the go, subjected to terms of use.\n\n> For other types of license, contact the [Azion Sales Team](https://www.azion.com/en/contact-sales/).\n",

You can also decide which data you want to use on your analysis by choosing among the available variables.\n\nBy creating a data streaming, you can:\n\n- Have an organized set of logs.\n- Connect your data streamings to endpoints.\n- Understand the behavior of your users.\n- Analyze the performance of your content and applications.\n- Identify data on security threats.\n- Make informed decisions.\n- Improve your applications and your business through reliable observability practices.\n\nAfter configuring your data streaming, you can check your logs successfully being sent through [Real-Time Events](/en/documentation/products/real-time-events/).\n\nSee the [Data Streaming first steps](/en/documentation/products/data-streaming/first-steps/).\n\n---\n\n## Logs\n\nBy default, Data Streaming sends your event logs when the code block with variables reaches *2000 records*, *every 60 seconds*, or when the packet size reaches the value determined in the *payload Max Size field*, whichever occurs first. However, in case you're using the AWS Kinesis Firehose endpoint, Data Streaming will send your event logs when the block reaches *500 records* or every *60 seconds*.\n\nTo find detailed reference about each section of configuring a Data Streaming, keep reading the following subsections.\n\n---\n\n## Selecting data sources\n\nA **Data Source** represents the application at Azion that generates the event logs you want to use. By selecting one, you decide where your data will be collected from and the remaining product settings are configured according to your choice.\n\nSelecting a Data Source in the dropdown list is mandatory. You can choose between:\n\n- [Activity History](#activity-history)\n- [Edge Applications](#edge-applications)\n- [Edge Functions](#edge-functions)\n- [WAF Events](#waf-events)\n\nEach data source has a preset of *variables*, combined in a template, representing the specific information you can receive from your event logs. See each data source's prerequisites and variables and what data they provide next.\n\n### Activity History\n\nThe **Activity History** data source displays the data for [logs activity](/en/documentation/products/accounts/activity-history/) regarding your account on RTM.

Example: 0.876. **In case of cache, the response is `-`**. |\n| $upstream_status | HTTP status code of the origin. If a server cannot be selected, the variable keeps the 502 (Bad Gateway) status code. Example: 200. **In case of cache, the response is `-`**. |\n| $waf_attack_action | Reports WAF’s action regarding the action. Can be: $BLOCK, $PASS, $LEARNING_BLOCK, or $LEARNING_PASS. |\n| $waf_attack_family | Informs the classification of the WAF infraction detected in the request. Example: SQL, XSS, TRAVERSAL, among others. |\n| $waf_block | Informs whether the WAF blocked the action or not. `0` when action *wasn't* blocked and `1` when action *was* blocked. When in *Learning Mode*, it won't be blocked regardless of the return. |\n| $waf_headers | When the request headers sent by the user are analyzed by the WAF module and tagged as **blocked** with `$waf_block = 1`, it contains a `base64` encoded string. Otherwise, it contains a dash character `-`. It applies to both *WAF Learning* or *Blocking* modes. |\n| $waf_learning | Informs if WAF is in Learning mode. Can be `0` or `1`. |\n| $waf_match | List of infractions found in the end user's request. It's formed by key-value elements: the *key* refers to the type of violation detected; the *value* shows the string that generated the infraction. |\n| $waf_score | Reports the score that will be increased in case of a match with the rules set for the WAF. |\n| $waf_total_blocked | Informs the total number of blocked requests. |\n| $waf_total_processed | Informs the total number of processed requests. |\n\n> You can add the $traceback variable when using a custom template for the Edge Applications data source if you have the *Debug rules* option activated in your application. See more on [Debugging rules on Edge Application](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/rules-engine/#debugging-rules).\n\nThe variables: `$upstream_bytes_received`, `$upstream_cache_status`, `$upstream_connect_time`, `$upstream_header_time`, `$upstream_response_time`, and `$upstream_status` can have *more than one comma-separated element*. When a connection is triggered, either by internal redirection or choice of source with [Load Balancer](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/load-balancer/), for example, each value contained in the field represents the respective initiated connection. The field can be separated by:\n\n- A comma, representing multiple IPs.\n- A colon, representing internal redirection.\n\nIf several servers were contacted during the request processing, their addresses are separated by *commas*. For example: `192.168.1.1:80, 192.168.1.2:80`.\n\nIf an internal redirect from one server group to another happens, initiated by *X-Accel-Redirect* or *Error Responses*, then the server addresses from different groups are separated by *colons*. For example: `192.168.1.1:80, 192.168.1.2:80, unix:/tmp/sock : 192.168.10.1:80, 192.168.10.2:80`.\n\nIf a server can't be selected, the variable keeps the name of the server group.\n\nConsidering multiple values as transitions in the connection, the last value tends to be the most important. If you use the *Error Responses* feature on your edge applications, you'll see two values on upstream fields that represent the status of the origin and the result of the request that was made to get the content to be delivered instead. In normal cases, you may get `502 : 200`.\n\n*502* is the HTTP error code for the response of the first try to get content from the origin server. Because it returned an *502* error, considering you have configured an Error Responses for status 502, another request will be made in order to get the URI defined. Then, the page will be delivered and the HTTP status will be added to the *upstream* fields, respecting its position for all of them. In this example, it results in the `502 : 200` composition.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Functions\n\nThe **Edge Functions** data source provides the data from requests made to your [edge functions](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-functions/) at Azion.

After selecting your data source, you can:\n\n- Select the corresponding template, provided by Azion.\n- Customize your own template, choosing which variables you want to use.\n\nYou can find four templates provided by Azion and a **Custom Template**, which provides you the option to decide which variables to use. Templates are available in the **Template** dropdown menu and the variables for the templates are shown in the **Data Set** code field in JSON format.\n\nSee which template corresponds to which data source:\n\n| Data Source | Template |\n| --- | --- |\n| Activity History | Activity History Collector |\n| Edge Applications | Edge Applications + WAF Event Collector |\n| Edge Functions | Edge Functions Event Collector |\n| WAF Events | WAF Event Collector |\n| all | Custom Template |\n\nBy selecting one of the templates provided by Azion, you can't modify the variables shown in the **Data Set** code field. If you select **Custom Template**, you're able to customize which variables you want to use according to your needs.\n\n> See the [How to create a custom template on Data Streaming](/en/documentation/products/guides/data-streaming-custom-template/) guide for more information on how to customize your own Data Set.\n\n---\n\n## Associating domains\n\nYou can associate your [existing domains](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/domains/) registered on Azion to your data streaming. If you haven't registered any domains to your account yet, see the [Creating a new domain associated with your edge application](/en/documentation/products/getting-started/#creating-domain) documentation.\n\nWhen you associate a domain, the events related with that or those specific domains are collected and sent to the endpoint you configure through a data streaming. You can associate one or more domains and you have the option to **Filter Domains** or select **All Domains**.\n\nWhen you select **All Domains**, the platform automatically selects all current *and future* domains you have on your RTM account.\n\n> See the [How to associate domains on Data Streaming](/en/documentation/products/guides/data-streaming-associate-domains/) guide for more information on how to use this field.\n\nIn case you select the **All Domains** option, you can also set the percentage of data you want to receive randomly from your data streaming through the *Sampling* option. In addition to filtering by sampling, it can also reduce costs of data collection and analysis.\n\n> Currently, the *Sampling* option isn't available for all RTM accounts. If you'd like to use it on your account, [contact our sales team](https://www.azion.com/en/contact-sales/).\n\nThe **Sampling (%)** field should contain the percentage of data you want to receive. This percentage will return the total data related to all your domains.\n\nWhen the Sampling option is enabled, you're allowed to add only *one* data streaming on your account. Once this data streaming is disabled, the **Add Streaming** option will be enabled again on the Data Streaming screen on RTM.\n\n---\n\n## Setting an endpoint\n\nThe *endpoint* is the destination where you want to send the data collected by Azion to, which is usually a stream processing platform or analysis tool you use. The endpoint type represents the method you want to configure as a destination to your data.\n\nAzion supports the following endpoints:\n\n- [Apache Kafka](#apache-kafka)\n- [AWS Kinesis Data Firehose](#aws-kinesis-data-firehose)\n- [Azure Blob Storage](#azure-blob-storage)\n- [Azure Monitor](#azure-monitor)\n- [Datadog](#datadog)\n- [Elasticsearch](#elasticsearch)\n- [Google BigQuery](#google-bigquery)\n- [IBM QRadar](#ibm-qradar)\n- [Simple Storage Service (S3)](#s3)\n- [Splunk](#splunk)\n- [Standard HTTP/HTTPS POST](#standard-http-https-post)\n\n> Can't find the endpoint connector you're looking for? Take part in a quick [Data Streaming connector survey](https://forms.gle/jhUTEsoqbdn174j59) and share the ones you use and would like to find here.\n\nTo configure an endpoint, you must select an **Endpoint Type** from the dropdown list in RTM.

You define the bucket name. Example: `mys3bucket`\n    - The bucket must be created before enabling Data Streaming to send the objects.\n- **Region**: the region in which your bucket is hosted. Example: `us-east-1`\n- **Access Key**: the public key to access your bucket given by your provider. Example: `ORIA5ZEH9MW4NL5OITY4`\n- **Secret Key**: the secret key to access your bucket given by your provider. Example: `+PLjkUWJyOLth3anuWXcLLVrMLeiiiThIokaPEiw`\n- **Object Key Prefix**: a prefix that you can add to your uploaded object to the files that will be sent. The objects' names are composed of *Prefix* + *Timestamp* + *UUID*. Example: if you use *waf_logs* as the prefix, one of the sent objects will be saved as `waf_logs_1622575860091_37d66e78-c308-4006-9d4d-1c013ed89276`\n- **Content Type**: the format in which the object will be created in your bucket. You can chose between *plain/text* or *application/gzip*.\n\n> For more information on using an Amazon S3 endpoint, see the [Using Amazon S3 to receive data from Azion Data Streaming](/en/documentacao/produtos/guias/amazon-s3-endpoint/) guide.\n\n---\n\n### Splunk\n\nTo configure the [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/) endpoint, you need access to their platform to get the required information:\n\n- **Splunk URL**: the URL that will receive the collected data. If you have an alternative index to point, you can add it at the end of the URL. Example: `https://inputs.splunkcloud.com:8080/services/collector?index=myindex`\n- **API Key**: the HTTP Event Collector Token provided during your Splunk installation. Example: `crfe25d2-23j8-48gf-a9ks-6b75w3ska674`\n\n> For more information, see the [Using Splunk to receive data from Azion Data Streaming](/en/documentation/products/guides/endpoint-splunk/) guide.\n\n---\n\n### Standard HTTP/HTTPS POST\n\n> You can customize a [payload](#customizing-payload) when using this endpoint.\n\nTo configure the Standard HTTP/HTTPS POST endpoint, you need to get the required information:\n\n- **Endpoint URL**: the URL that will receive the collected data. Example: `https://app.domain.com/`\n- **Custom Headers** (*optional*): the *names* and *values* for each header to send to the endpoint. You can enter one or more custom headers for your HTTP/HTTPS request. Example: `header-name:value`\n\n---\n\n## Customizing payload\n\n> This feature is only available for the **Standard HTTP/HTTPS POST** endpoint.\n\nWhen using the Standard HTTP/HTTPS POST, the payload for your endpoint isn't predefined. You have the option to customize the essential information that will be sent in your data as you best see fit.\n\nTo customize the payload sent by the connector in **Data Streaming**, you have the following fields:\n\n- **Max Size** (*optional*): defines the size of data packets that will be sent in *bytes*. It accepts values starting from *1000000*.\n- **Log Line Separator** (*optional*): defines what information will be used at the end of each log line. Used to break information into different lines.\n- **Payload Format** (*optional*): defines which information will be sent in your data, for each data streaming request.\n\nBy default, Data Streaming recommends a NDJSON format with the use of `\\n` as a log line separator and `$dataset` as a payload format, which uses the information from the **Data Set** code box, describing the variables chosen as a template.\n\nYou can choose other options for both fields. Depending on your logs, you can use `,` as a log line separator, for example.\n\nA NDJSON format isn't wrapped with typical JSON arrays `[]`, and each data is presented in a different line, without a comma separating them. It can be useful for structured data with processing of one record at a time. A JSON format, on the other hand, is well known and has tabular data, using arrays `[]` and being separated by commas. With it, the payload can be treated as a single record.\n\nFor example, if the **Log Line Separator** receives `,` and the **Payload Format** receives `[$dataset]`, and the template has the following variables in the **Data Set** code box:\n\n$request_method\\\n$host\\\n$status\n\nYou get a JSON response similar to this:\n\n```json\n    [\n    \t{\n\t\t\t\"request_method\": \"GET\",\n         \t\"host\": \"www.onedomain.com\",\n          \"status\": \"200\"\n        },\n        {\n        \t\"request_method\": \"POST\",\n          \t\"host\": \"www.anotherdomain.com.br\",\n          \t\"status\": \"200\"\n        }\n\t]\n```\n\nBut if the **Log Line Separator** receives `\\n` and the **Payload Format** receives `$dataset`, you get a NDJSON response similar to this:\n\n```json\n{\"request_method\": \"GET\", \"host\": \"www.onedomain.com\", \"status\": \"200\"}\n{\"request_method\": \"POST\", \"host\": \"www.anotherdomain.com.br\", \"status\": \"200\"}\n```\n\n### Customizing payload with Activity History\n\nYou can customize the payload with specific information if you're using the [Activity History](#activity-history) data source and the [Standard HTTP/HTTPS POST](#standard-http-https-post) endpoint.\n\nThe following information must be used in the payload fields to configure it:\n\n- **Log Line Separator**: \\n\n- **Payload Format**: 'v1\\t$time_iso8601\\t$clientid\\t$title\\t$comment\\t$type\\t$author_name\\t$author_email'\n\n---\n\n## Status code\n\n**Data Streaming** servers work in two steps: they monitor the endpoints once a minute (1x/min) and state whether the endpoint is *available* or *unavailable*. The cost of sending messages with an error is very high, so prior monitoring is required.\n\nData Streaming attempts to send messages to endpoints that are *available*. If the endpoint is *unavailable*, messages aren't sent, as the information is discarded. During the next minute, Data Streaming sends the data again if the endpoint is considered *available*.\n\nThe endpoint must be approved by all Azion servers to be considered as *available*. If one of the servers indicates that the endpoint is *unavailable*, messages aren't sent.\n\n### HTTP 504 Status Behavior\n\nOccurs when the endpoint responds to the test successfully, but doesn't receive messages within the timeout: *20 seconds* for HTTP POST type endpoints.\n\n### HTTP 503 Status Behavior\n\nOccurs when the endpoint is declared *unavailable* by endpoint monitoring. Therefore, Data Streaming doesn't attempt to send the messages.\n\nSince the system is distributed, it isn't possible to know the specific server that sends messages to each endpoint.\n",

    "body": "\n**Application Acceleration** is an **Edge Application** module that speeds up web applications and APIs through protocol optimizations and manages dynamic content requirements. This module enables the **Advanced Cache Key** functionality, as well as new  options to customize your rules using [Rules Engine](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/rules-engine/), and provides support for HTTP methods.\n\n---\n\n## How it works\n\n**Application Acceleration** is an **Edge Application** module that optimizes protocols and manages the different requirements of static and dynamic content in order to accelerate the performance of web applications and APIs.\n\nBy keeping processes within Azion's edge nodes, Application Acceleration can help you increase the performance of APIs and decrease the complexity of the infrastructure at the backend.\n\nWith Application Acceleration, you can:\n\n- Create advanced rules in [Rules Engine](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/rules-engine/) for HTTP request and response phases.\n- Use the **Advanced Cache Key** functionality to customize cache policies for dynamic content based on cookies or query strings.\n- Enable support for POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE methods for Edge Application, as well as the natively supported GET, HEAD and OPTIONS methods.\n- Customize [CDN cache TTL](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-caching/#cdn-cache-settings) to values under 60 seconds.\n\n---\n\n## Advanced Cache Key\n\nBy default, Azion considers each URL as a distinct object in cache. The **Advanced Cache Key** feature allows you to create advanced cache rules based on two options: [Query Strings](#cache-by-query-string) and [Cookies](#cache-by-cookie). If needed, you can use both options simultaneously to define the content segmentation of your application.\n\n> See the guide on [How to configure Advanced Cache Key for Edge Application](/en/documentation/products/guides/apis-performance-sites-application-acceleration/).\n\n### Cache by Query String options \n\nAt Azion, you define how you want the content to be cached according to **Query String** variations in your URLs:\n\n- **Content does not vary by Query String (Improves Caching)**: defines that the cache key must ignore the Query String. That is, two URLs that are different just by the variation of the Query String will be considered as the same cached object. For example, `http://yourdomain.com/path?queryA` and `http://yourdomain.com/path?queryB` will deliver the same cache content to your users.\n\n- **Content varies by some Query String fields (Whitelist)**: you can list which Query String fields should be considered to differentiate between objects in the Azion cache. All other fields will be ignored. For example, if you list the `city` field, the URLs `http://yourdomain.com/path?city=A&name=X` and `http://yourdomain.com/path?city=A&name=Y` will be considered as a single object in cache, while URLs `http://yourdomain.com/path?city=A&name=X` and `http://yourdomain.com/path?city=B&name=X` will be considered as different objects.\n\n- **Content varies by Query String, except for some fields (Blocklist)**: you can list which fields in the Query String should be ignored when differentiating cached objects. All other fields will be considered. For example, if you list the `random` field, the URLs `http://yourdomain.com/path?city=A&random=123` and `http://yourdomain.com/path?city=B&random=123` will be considered different object in cache, while `http://yourdomain.com/path?city=A&random=123` and `http://yourdomain.com/path?city=A&random=456` will be considered as the same object in cache.\n\n- **Content varies by all Query String fields**: defines that the cache key must consider all fields of the Query String. That is, two URLs distinct by the variation of the Query String will be considered as two distinct objects in the cache. For example, `http://yourdomain.com/path?queryA` and `http://yourdomain.com/path?queryB` will be stored as separate objects in the Azion cache.\n\nIn order to increase caching efficiency, you can enable the **Query String Sort** option. If activated, it orders all the fields of the Query String, making the position of the fields irrelevant in the definition of the cache key. If the position of the fields is relevant to differentiate your content, you should disable this option.\n\n### Cache by Cookie options\n\nYou can also distinguish objects in the Azion cache by name/value of cookies.\n\n- **Content does not vary by Cookies (Improves Caching)**: differentiates objects in Azion's cache through URL; doesn't take cookies into account.\n\n- **Content varies by some Cookies (Allowed Rules)**: you can list the name of the cookies that your application uses to differentiate cached objects. All other cookies will be ignored, allowing you to segment your content by user profiles and other settings. This is the most recommended option if you use cookies to manage user sessions.\n\n- **Content varies by Cookies, with the exception of a few (Blocklist)**: you can list the name of the cookies you want to ignore in the cache key setting, considering all cookies except those listed.\n\n- **Content varies by all Cookies**: in addition to the URL, it considers all cookies to differentiate objects in Azion's cache.\n\n> **Tip**: use this feature to segment your content by user profile, browsing session, access region, or according to your content targeting needs.\n\n---\n\n## Bypass Cache\n\nYou can also use Azion to deliver your dynamic and personalized content, even when some of your content can't be cached in Azion's infrastructure. At Azion, you define cache rules per path. You can create a **Bypass Cache** rule for the paths of your website that won't be cached in our infrastructure.\n\nBy using Bypass Cache, you'll configure Azion's service to forward all requests to a path directly to their origin. However, you'll count on important protocol optimizations to speed up your application and a keepalive connection between Azion edge nodes and their origin whenever possible.\n\n> See the guide on [How to configure cache policies for Edge Application](/en/documentation/products/guides/edge-caching/#bypass-cache) for more information on Bypass Cache.\n\n### Difference between Bypass Cache and TTL 0\n\nWhile both the **Bypass Cache** behavior and **Maximum TTL** at zero seconds allow you to optimize content delivery and reduce load times at the origin, their effects are a bit different.\n\nBy using the Bypass Cache behavior, all HTTP and HTTPS requests received by Azion's edge nodes will be sent to the origin, without caching any content. Use Bypass Cache if you want to deliver different content for each user request.\n\nHowever, when setting TTL to 0 (zero) seconds, multiple requests in parallel to Azion's edge nodes will be sent as a single request to their origin. In this case, Azion's edge nodes also validate changes to the content with its origin by using the *If-Modified-Since* parameter. If the object hasn't changed since the last request, the content won't need to be transferred again, which could result in a much faster *304 Not Modified* response. Also, setting maximum cache TTL to 0 will still generate a cache object that lives for 999 milliseconds.\n\n> **Tip**: you can set TTL to zero if the dynamic content, which varies from time to time, can be delivered identically to all users who make simultaneous requests.\n\n---\n\n## Forward Cookies\n\nIf your origin manages application cookies, you may need the **Forward Cookies** functionality. By default, Azion filters the Response Header `Set-Cookie` sent by the origin. If you wish, you can configure Azion so that `Set-Cookie` is passed on to your users.\n\nBy using the Forward Cookies functionality, you're determining that Azion forwards the `Set-Cookie` header received from your origin, even in a cache hit. To prevent a user from receiving another user's `Set-Cookie` session, you must list all session cookies (private cookies) your application must ignore using the [Advanced Cache Key](#cache-by-cookie).\n\n> See the guide on [How to configure cache policies for Edge Application](/en/documentation/products/guides/edge-caching/#forward-cookies) for more information on Forward Cookies.\n\n### JavaScript Cookies\n\nAn alternative to sending the response header `Set-Cookie` is to create cookies using **JavaScript**, which allows you to create, read, and expire cookies through the `document.cookie` property.\n\nA [JavaScript cookie](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_cookies.asp) should have the following format:\n\n```js\ndocument.cookie = “username=John Doe; expires=Thu, 18 Dec 2020 12:00:00 UTC; path=/”;\n```\n\nBy default, Azion won't filter the request header `Cookie` regardless of its **Forward Cookies** configuration and therefore JavaScript Cookies may be sent to the origin to enable the management of your application.\n\n---\n\n## Support for HTTP methods\n\nThe `GET`, `HEAD`, and `OPTIONS` HTTP methods are already natively supported in any edge application. By enabling **Application Acceleration**, you'll be able to use `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` methods.\n",

    "body": "\n**Device Groups** is an **Edge Application** capability that allows you to identify the devices that will send requests to your application and categorize them into groups. You can use Device Groups to set custom application behaviors and cache policies based on the groups you create.\n\n---\n\n## How it works\n\nUsers that access applications created in [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com) send Azion data via HTTP request headers. The `User-Agent` header stores information on the user’s browser, operating system, version, and manufacturer. This header follows the syntax:\n\n```yaml\nUser-Agent: <product>/<product-version> <comment>\n```\n\n**Where:**\n\n- `product`: product identifier.\n- `product-version`: version number of the product.\n- `comment`: system information, platform name and details, and extensions.\n\nFor instance, the following `User-Agent` header indicates that a Windows machine has accessed the application using Mozilla Firefox:\n\n```yaml\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/47.0\n```\n\n**Device Groups** works by matching the contents of the `User-Agent` header to a regular expression of your choice. Once you've created a device group, you can configure a rule or a cache policy specifically for the devices within the group.\n\n---\n\n## Usage\n\n**Device Groups** can be used to identify the devices that send requests to your application and categorize them accordingly.\n\nFor example, you can create a device group called *Mobile* whose regular expression must match the contents within the `User-Agent` header that identifies mobile devices. The following expression can be used to identify most of the existing mobile devices:\n\n```\n(Mobile|iP(hone|od)|BlackBerry|IEMobile)\n```\n\nThe *Mobile* device group can then be referenced in your application's **Rules Engine** tab or in the **Cache Settings** tab.\n\n### Rules Engine\n\nWhen you create a rule, you can use the variable `${device_group}` to define which behaviors your application should perform for the device groups you’ve created. To reference a device group, you can add its name to the argument section after you select the desired comparison operator.\n\n> To activate this variable, you must enable [Application Acceleration](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/application-acceleration/).\n\nThe following criteria identifies whether the user request comes from a device that matches a device group named *Mobile*:\n\n|  | Variable | Comparison Operator | Argument |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| If | `${device_group}` | is equal to | Mobile |\n\nRules Engine can also identify devices using the `${http_user_agent}` variable directly by adding a string or regular expression as an argument. That way, you can identify specific devices without having to dedicate a device group to them.\n\nThe following criteria identifies whether the user request comes from an iPhone device:\n\n|  | Variable | Comparison Operator | Argument |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| If | `${http_user_agent}` | matches | `(?i)iPhone` |\n\n[Find out more about Rules Engine](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/rules-engine/).\n\n---\n\n### Adaptive Delivery\n\nIn the **Cache Settings** tab of your **Edge Application**, you can reference an existing device group for **Adaptive Delivery**.\n\nWhen choosing the option **Content varies by some Device Groups (Whitelist)**, you are allowing Azion to keep device-based variations of its objects in the cache.\n\n> You can choose one or more device groups to apply the same Adaptive Delivery policies. To activate Adaptive Delivery, [contact our Sales team](https://www.azion.com/en/contact-sales).\n\n[Find out more about Cache Settings](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-caching/#advanced-cache-key).\n\n---\n\n## Prioritization\n\n**Device Groups** will prioritize matches first-to-last, regardless of the order within the `User-Agent` header from the request. Given the following list of device groups:\n\n| Device group | Regular expression |\n| --- | --- |\n| Mobile | `(Mobile\\|Android)` |\n| Tablet | `(iPad\\|Android)` |\n| Desktop | `(Chrome\\|Mozilla)` |\n\nIf the request is made by a device that contains `Android Tablet Mobile (Mozilla Firefox)` in its header, the words `Android` and `Mobile` will match the *Mobile* group.\n\nHowever, for a request from `iPad Apple Webkit Mobile`, the device will be identified as *Mobile* owing to the presence of `Mobile` within the request, despite `iPad` matching the *Tablet* device group.\n\nWhen setting up your rules, keep in mind that `User-Agent` headers for different devices can sometimes contain the same words. For instance: `Google Chrome Android` likely came from a mobile device while `Google Chrome Symbian` likely belongs to a desktop; both used the same Google Chrome application to access the application. Make sure to use precise wording when grouping devices.\n",

    "body": "\nYou need a TLS certificate to transfer data over HTTPS. Using the HTTPS protocol with a certificate ensures that your customers' data is securely transferred over the Internet, demonstrates the reliability of your website and the authenticity of your domain, and improves your website's position in search engines like Google.\n\nAt Azion, you can rely on the following TLS certificate options for HTTPS traffic:\n\n- **Azion SAN**: register your domain as a Subject Alternate Name (SAN) under Azion's certificate.\n- **Custom certificate**: add your personal TLS certificate obtained from a Certificate Authority (CA).\n- **Let's Encrypt certificate**: request the issuance of a *Let's Encrypt*™ certificate managed automatically by Azion.\n\nYou can also issue a **Certificate Signing Request (CSR)** via Azion to request a certificate from a CA.\n\n---\n\n## Azion SAN certificate\n\nWhen using Azion **Edge Application**, our TLS certificate for HTTPS traffic is available at no additional cost. When you create a domain for an edge application in [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/), your application is assigned an address in the `azionedge.net` zone.\n\nIf you wish, you may use the assigned domain to deliver your static content over HTTPS, avoiding the costs of issuing TLS certificates for approval environments or URLs whose domain can be shared with other Azion customers. This way, your domain will be registered as a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) under Azion's TLS certificate.\n\n---\n\n## Custom certificate\n\nIf you want to use a custom domain, you can register your own TLS certificate (X.509) at no additional cost in [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com). To use this feature, you'll need to prove that the domain is really yours.\n\nTo use your Custom Certificate with Azion, the Server Name Indication (SNI) extension of the TLS protocol is used. Check the [browser list with SNI support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=sni).\n\n### Validation\n\nThere are three types of validations that you can choose:\n\n| Domain Validation (DV) | Organization Validation (OV) | Extended Validation (EV) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Validates your right to use the domain and it's the simplest of the three options. This is the option recommended by Azion for most companies. | Validates your right to use the domain and some further validations about the requesting organization. | It's an extended validation, which requires additional documentation to prove the physical, legal, and operational existence of the requesting organization and the most complex of the three options. |\n\n### Encryption types\n\nAzion currently works with two types of certificates: *RSA* and *ECC/ECDSA*. Each certificate has its characteristics and its security level, and Azion allows you to choose the option that best fits your scenario.\n\n#### RSA\n\nRivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) is one of the earliest public key cryptography systems and it is widely used for the secure transmission of data. In this encryption system, the encryption key is public and is different from the decryption key that is secret (private). Any message encrypted using a public key can only be decrypted using the respective private key.\n\nRSA is a relatively slow algorithm and is therefore less used to directly encrypt user data. Most often, RSA passes shared encrypted keys to symmetric key encryption, which in turn can perform mass encryption-decryption operations at a much faster rate.\n\n#### ECC/ECDSA\n\nElliptical Curve Cryptography (ECC), specifically *Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)* for digital certificate encryption, is an approach to public key cryptography based on the algebraic structure of elliptical curves. Public key cryptography is based on creating mathematical puzzles that are difficult to solve, therefore it becomes much more secure than other types of certificates such as RSA.\n\nSmaller keys are less computationally intensive to generate signatures because they involve smaller mathematical numbers. ECC is faster in generating signatures and has better performance than RSA.\n\n---\n\n## Let's Encrypt certificate \n\n[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)™ is a nonprofit global CA that allows people and organizations to obtain, renew, and manage TLS certificates for free. When [creating a Domain](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/domains/) with Azion, you may choose to obtain a TLS certificate signed by Let's Encrypt. You can request Let's Encrypt certificates for domains hosted in [Intelligent DNS](/en/documentation/products/intelligent-dns/) or in a third-party DNS provider.\n\nOnce you [create a domain with Azion](/en/documentation/products/getting-started/#step-4-creating-a-new-domain-associated-with-your-edge-application), you can choose the option **Let's Encrypt** to automatically generate a Let's Encrypt certificate. An entry for this certificate will be listed in the **Digital Certificates** page in [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/). After the certificate undergoes DNS validation, issuance, and storage, it'll become active.\n\n> See [How to generate a Let's Encrypt for your domain](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-generate-a-lets-encrypt-certificate/) to know how to validate this type of certificate.\n\nActive Let's Encrypt certificates *will be renewed automatically before the expiration date* of 90 days, provided that you don't bind a custom certificate to the domain or delete the associated domain. Certificates that were unbound from a domain can be rebound if they remain valid.\n\n### CNAME configuration\n\nWhen you create an Azion **Domain** and select the **Let's Encrypt certificate** option, you can list up to 50 CNAMEs to request the certificate. CNAMEs listed after a top-level domain are registered as *Subject Alternative Names* (SAN).\n\nWhen you modify the CNAME list on the domain settings, Azion will create a new certificate based on the modified set of CNAMEs, and the old entry won't be renewed by the certificate manager.\n\n#### Status\n\nIf any of the CNAMEs hosted in external providers fail the [DNS-01 challenge](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-generate-a-lets-encrypt-certificate/#option-2-preparing-dns-entry-with-an-external-dns-provider), the certificate won't be generated and will remain with the *Pending* status.\n\n#### Wildcard usage\n\nYou can use wildcard CNAMEs (`*.domain.com`) or mix wildcard and non-wildcard CNAMEs in the same Domain. However, when using the wildcard notation, you don't have to specify subdomains that are already covered by the wildcard. For instance, if you decide that the certificate should be applied to `*.domain.com`, you don't need to include `blog.domain.com` in the CNAME list.\n\nThe hostname resolution follows Azion's standard rules: specific domains have precedence over wildcard ones. For example, a Let's Encrypt certificate for a Domain `blog.domain.com` will take precedence over another certificate for the Domain `*.domain.com`.\n\n---\n\n### Certificate Signing Request\n\nA Certificate Signing Request (CSR) is one of the first steps towards getting your own TLS certificate. For customers with contracted FIPS 140 support, the private key will be stored in an HSM that uses a cryptographic module certified in the FIPS-140 Level 3 standard.\n\n---\n\n## Trademarks\n\n[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) is a trademark of [Internet Security Research Group](https://www.abetterinternet.org/).

    "body": "\n**Domains** is an Azion's [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/) tool that provides a domain generation and management service.\n\n---\n\n## How it works\n\n**Domains** is a standard feature available for all **Edge Applications** on Azion. When you [build an edge application](/en/documentation/products/getting-started/), your application is given an automatically generated **Azion domain**, in the format `xxxx.map.azionedge.net`. You can create multiple domains for your edge applications.\n\nIf you already own a domain, you can redirect your traffic to Azion by configuring record in your DNS provider and listing your **custom domain** CNAME into the domain in **RTM**.\n\nYou may also bind a [Digital Certificate](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/digital-certificate/) to domains that use the HTTPs protocol.\n\n---\n\n## Environment\n\nBefore going operational, you can activate a testing configuration to preview setups. When creating a new Domain, you can choose the environment type:\n\n* **Production**: production environment of the application. The Azion domain will be in the format `xxxx.map.azionedge.net`.\n* **Preview**: environment for testing the application. This configuration won't impact the **Production** environment. The Azion domain will be in the format `xxxx.preview.azionedge.net`.\n\nTo enable environment selection, contact the [Sales Team](https://www.azion.com/en/contact-sales/).\n\n---\n\n## CNAME\n\nCNAME is the standard service responsible for creating CNAME settings, enabling you to customize the edge application's  domain. Each domain can accommodate up to 50 CNAMEs.\n\nYou may restrict access to your application from the Azion domain by enabling the **CNAME Access Only** switch.\n\n---\n\n## Digital Certificates\n\nTo use your domain in HTTPS, you'll need a TLS certificate (X.509). Without additional costs, you may include your TLS certificates in [Real-Time Manager](http://manager.azion.com) or generate a *Let's Encrypt*™ certificate, which will be automatically managed by Azion.\n\n[Find out more about Digital Certificates](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/digital-certificates/).\n\n---\n\n## Support for Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS)\n\nAzion's Domains also have **Support for Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS)**, an authentication method for users and visitors that validates the digital certificate on both sides of a request, client, and edge (server). Adding support for mTLS to your **Edge Application** ensures a more secure *TLS/TLS handshake* and is an *Open Banking* requirement.\n\n> **Tip**: you may need mTLS if your Edge Application deals with financial services and payments.\n\nTo enable this feature, contact our [Sales Team](https://www.azion.com/en/contact-sales/).\n\n[Find out more about mTLS](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/domains/mtls/).\n",

However, it does promise a more secure TLS *handshake* and is an *Open Banking* requirement.\n\n> You may need mTLS if your Edge Application offers financial services and payments.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nIt's necessary that your **Edge Application** is operating with the *Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)* protocol. [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com) allows you to configure **mTLS** in applications running with HTTP only (without the TLS encryption layer). However, mTLS requires an HTTPS connection to work.\n\nProtocol options are available on your **Edge Application** configuration page in RTM.\n\n> **Note:** mTLS will only be available if the service is activated. Contact our [Sales Team](https://www.azion.com/en/contact-sales/) to activate it.\n\n## Digital Certificate with support for mTLS (Trusted CA)\n\nTo configure **mTLS** in your **Edge Application**, you need a *Digital Certificate* that supports mTLS, generated by a *Third-Party Certificate Authority*. At Azion, we call this certificate **Trusted CA**.\n\nSelect or add a new *Domain* and make sure the mTLS option is enabled. Then select the previously added Trusted CA.\n\n> Free certificates, generated internally by Azion (Azion [SAN]), don't support mTLS.\n\nTo use mTLS *Enforce* mode, you must use *Server Name Indication (SNI)* extension to the traditional TLS protocol.\n\nConnections without SNI are connected to the default configuration, which, at the time of the TLS handshake, delivers the Azion SAN certificate.\n\nWhen we have requests without SNI for a Domain with mTLS in *Enforce* mode, the connection will be interrupted before the route of your Edge Application is resolved.\n\n> Make sure your Edge Applications always use SNI on requests.\n\n## How mTLS works at Azion\n\nThe default configuration of **mTLS** blocks accesses whose user identity can't be verified.\n\nIf your application needs special access, it is necessary to configure a permissive check (*Permissive mTLS*). Permissive checking can be configured on the *Domains* page.\n\nYou can also change and specify the *header variables* of your **mTLS** to meet Open Banking requirements. This can be done in the **Edge Application** configuration page, within [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com).\n\n> The list of accepted variables is available on the [Rules Engine for Edge Application](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/rules-engine/) page.\n",

    "body": "\n**Edge Application** is a product that lets you build web applications on Azion Edge Network, reducing latency and throughput between origin servers and users. You can define how your content will be cached, execute functions and business rules, and optimize content delivery for your users.\n\n> Learn how to create an edge application in the [getting started](/en/documentation/products/getting-started/) guide.\n\n---\n\n## How it works\n\n**Edge Application** works with a reverse proxy architecture. When you build an application in [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/) and point the traffic from your domain to Azion, your users will access your application through our highly distributed global network of edge nodes.\n\n> See the [documentation on Domains](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/domains/) for more information on how to associate a domain to an edge application.\n\nThen, Azion selects which edge node closest to the user can handle the request, reducing latency and speeding up content transfer and downloads.\n\nIn this architecture, your content or web application has to be available from an origin, which can be one or more web servers in your infrastructure, a cloud service, or one of Azion Origin Services.\n\n> See the documentation on [Single Origin](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/single-origin/) and [Load Balancer](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/load-balancer/) to find out more about how to set up one or multiple origins.\n\n---\n\n## Edge Caching\n\nThrough Edge Caching, Azion's highly distributed global network allows you to deliver your content much more efficiently. Content that is successfully cached – cache hit – on Azion's edge nodes can be delivered directly to your users from the nearest Edge Node, without having to access the origin. In addition to increasing performance and scalability for your content, you can reduce costs on your origin infrastructure.\n\nA cache miss occurs when content is requested and it isn't in cache. The Edge Caching module minimizes the effect of cache miss by maintaining a keep-alive connection with the origin whenever possible, avoiding the overhead of the TCP/IP handshake. Regardless of the volume of simultaneous requests made to Azion's Edge Nodes, each Edge Node will search the content at the origin only once per cache miss, which substantially reduces the impact on your infrastructure.\n\n---\n\n## Delivery\n\n### Delivery Protocols\n\nYou can customize the delivery of your application by choosing the following options:\n\n- **HTTP**: delivers your application using only the HTTP protocol.\n- **HTTP & HTTPS**: delivers your application using both the HTTP and HTTPS protocols.\n\n> If you choose to deliver your application through **HTTP & HTTPS**, you must define a **minimum TLS version** and set up [Digital Certificates](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/digital-certificates) for your domain.\n\n### HTTP/3 support\n\n> HTTP/3 support is in early access. [Contact the Azion Sales team](https://www.azion.com/en/contact-sales/) to enable this functionality for your account.\n\nIf you choose to deliver your application through **HTTP & HTTPS**, you can enable **HTTP/3 support**. Based on the QUIC protocol standard, HTTP/3 provides faster load vibes and lower latency when compared to previous versions.\n\nWhen you enable HTTP/3 support, your edge applications can utilize this protocol version in compatible browsers only through *HTTP port 80* and *HTTPS port 443*, as well as *minimum TLS version 1.3*.\n\nUpon a user's first request to an edge application with HTTP/3, the handshake and first response will be conducted using TCP and HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2. The response from this exchange will assign a value to the [Alt-Svc header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Alt-Svc) that indicates that the latest version of the protocol is available to the browser. If the browser supports HTTP/3, the QUIC protocol and HTTP/3 will be used, unless the cached response misses or expires.\n\n### Ports\n\nAzion offers a simultaneous multiport solution, which means you can customize through which HTTP and HTTPS ports your application will be delivered to. You must choose *at least one port* for each protocol, but you can select from all available ports for delivery.\n\n> If you enable **HTTP/3 support**, multiport configuration will be overwritten to the default ports 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS. Simultaneous multiport isn't available for applications with HTTP/3 support.\n\n#### List of available ports\n\n| HTTP Port    | HTTPS Port     |\n|--------------|----------------|\n| 80 (default) | 443 (default)  |\n| 8080         | 8443           |\n| 8008         | 9440           |\n|              | 9441           |\n|              | 9442           |\n|              | 9443           |\n\n---\n\n## Minimum TLS version\n\nThe **Transport Layer Security (TLS)** protocol allows you to encrypt web traffic. The following TLS versions can be used with edge applications:\n\n- TLS 1.0 (*deprecated*)\n- TLS 1.1 (*deprecated*)\n- TLS 1.2\n- TLS 1.3\n\nYou can choose the minimum version of TLS that will be supported by your edge application. By choosing recent versions of the protocol, older devices or browsers might not be able to access the edge application.\n\n> If you enable **HTTP/3 support**, the minimum TLS version will be set to TLS 1.3.\n\nAzion blocks TLS Renegotiation and TLS Resumption by default. If you want to customize this setup, [contact the Azion Sales team](https://www.azion.com/en/contact-sales/).\n\n---\n\n## Ciphers\n\nCiphers are cryptography algorithms utilized to encrypt *plaintext* into *ciphertext*, which requires a key to be decrypted. Azion gives you the possibility to change the *cipher suite* your edge application will use in order to protect your application against TLS attacks.\n\nThe cipher suite will determine which cryptographic algorithms will be used in the TLS connections of your edge application. Both, client and server, will *negotiate* the cipher suite to securely encrypt and decrypt the data exchanged during the session.\n\nThe table below shows the ciphers available in each cipher suite.\n\n| Cipher                        | TLSv1.2_2018      | TLSv1.2_2019      | TLSv1.2_2021      | TLSv1.3_2022    |\n|-------------------------------|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:---------------:|\n| TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256        | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✕               |\n| TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384        | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✕               |\n| TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256  | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✕               |\n| ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✔︎               |\n| ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384 | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✔︎               |\n| ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305 | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✔︎               |\n| ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256   | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✔︎               |\n| ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384   | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✔︎               |\n| ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305   | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✔︎               |\n| ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA384     | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✕                 | ✕               |\n| ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA256     | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✕                 | ✕               |\n| ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256       | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✕                 | ✕               |\n| ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384       | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✕                 | ✕               |\n| AES128-SHA256                 | ✔︎                 | ✕                 | ✕                 | ✕               |\n| AES256-GCM-SHA384             | ✔︎                 | ✕                 | ✕                 | ✕               |\n| AES128-GCM-SHA256             | ✔︎                 | ✕                 | ✕                 | ✕               |\n\n> In the table above, the character ✔ indicates that the cipher in this line is present in the column group while ✕ indicates that the cipher in this line is not present in the column group.\n\n---\n\n## Edge Application Modules\n\n**Modules** can extend the capabilities of **Edge Application**. You can enable or disable modules in the **Main Settings** tab of your application, provided your account supports them and there are no existing dependencies upon deactivation. See the documentation for each module:\n\n| Module | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Application Acceleration](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/application-acceleration/) | Optimize API protocols and manage dynamic content delivery to accelerate web applications and APIs. |\n| [Edge Caching](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-caching/) | Configure cache settings to speed up the delivery of static and dynamic content. |\n| [Edge Functions](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-functions/) | Build ultra-low latency applications and customize content delivery. |\n| [Image Processor](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/image-processor/) | Optimize image processing for various devices, browsers, and screen resolutions. |\n| [Load Balancer](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/load-balancer/) | Balance traffic between your origin servers and cloud providers to improve fault tolerance and avoid network congestion. |\n\n---\n\n## Limits\n\n### Download rate\n\nWhen downloading large files in edge applications through connections around 3MB/s or slower, download reset may occur. The **Azion Platform** terminates connections that exceed the maximum session duration (10 to 15 minutes) by default and prioritizes dynamic, low-latency edge applications over large file transfers. For smoother downloads, consider switching to faster and more stable connections or implementing [file slicing](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-caching/#slice-settings), [compression](/en/documentation/products/guides/using-gzip-mime-types/) and edge caching in your application. If unexpected connection resets remain, [contact our Support team](https://www.azion.com/en/support/).\n",

    "body": "\n**Edge Caching** is an **Edge Application** module that reduces latency and enables a high transfer rate for your applications through Azion's global network of edge nodes.\n\n---\n\n## How it works\n\n**Edge Caching** is a standard module available for all Edge Applications on Azion, ensuring performance and low latency. It's comprised of a reverse proxy architecture, through which your users connect to the edge nodes of our highly distributed global network. Edge Caching can *cache* your content and further extend its versatility with the **L2 Caching** add-on.\n\nWhen a user requests content on the internet, their browser or application initiates the DNS resolution process in order to translate the requested domain into an IP address. When using Azion, you point your web application's DNS to an address generated when creating a Domain on Azion.\n\nAzion selects the Edge Node closest to the user by using its **Software-Defined Networking (SDN) Router**, reducing latency and increasing the speed of content transfer.\n\n---\n\n## Cache Settings \n\nThis service is responsible for creating cache configurations, containing several features that expand the way content is delivered.\n\n**Cache Settings** works with two versions:\n\n1. The first version focuses on static content. Thus, you don't need to have the **Application Acceleration** service enabled.\n2. The second version, which employs **Edge Caching**, extends numerous configuration options in the Cache Settings interface.\n\n> Check out the guide on [How to configure cache policies for Edge Application](/en/documentation/products/guides/edge-caching/) to create a custom cache setting.\n\n### Browser Cache Settings\n\nThe Browser Cache Settings configures the amount of time that content is cached in the user's browser. You can set the **Edge Application** to:\n\n| Honor Origin Cache Headers                    | Override Cache Settings                       |\n| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |\n| This feature honors the cache definitions sent by your origin servers through HTTP headers (*Cache-Control and Expires*), sending the same headers to the web browser. | This feature overrides the cache of your origin server and allows you to set the cache time-to-live (TTL) manually. |\n\n### CDN Cache Settings\n\n**CDN Cache Settings** is the amount of time Azion’s Edge Applications take to *cache* the content. You can set the **Edge Application** to:\n\n| Honor Origin Cache Headers                                   | Override Cache Settings                                      |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Maintains the cache definitions sent by your origin servers through HTTP headers (*Cache-Control and Expires*), sending the same headers to the web browser. | Overrides the cache setting of your origin server with the desired TTL.<br /><br />To set the TTL of CDN cache to values under 60 seconds, you must enable the [Application Acceleration](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/application-acceleration/) module. |\n\n> **Important**: when TTL for CDN cache values is lower than 10 seconds, there is a possibility that your application will experience recurring cache misses. This can happen when the origin servers are delayed in responding, such as during maintenance periods. In such situations, Azion recommends that you apply the [Bypass Cache](/documentation/products/edge-application/application-acceleration/#bypass-cache) behavior to your application or set a TTL value greater than 10 to accommodate CDN connection bursts to slower origin servers.\n\n---\n\n## L2 Caching\n\n> This functionality is only available if the service has been activated in your account. To activate **L2 Caching**, [contact our Sales team](https://www.azion.com/en/contact-sales/).\n\n**L2 Caching** is an additional layer of caching between Azion's edge and its origin that helps to further reduce the load on your infrastructure.\n\nWhen accessing your applications on Azion, your user accesses our highly distributed network capable of edge caching. By enabling L2 Caching in your edge applications, you have a second cache layer that will be responsible for feeding the edge, keeping your content cached for as long as you wish.\n\nWhen using L2 Caching as an additional caching layer, you must include a configuration per region. For example: `sa-brazil` for Brazil, `na-united-states` for the USA, etc., depending on the region.\n\nL2 Caching was specially designed for objects that can remain in cache for a long period of time. Thus, you can only activate it on cache policies with a TTL equal to or greater than *3 seconds*, with the default TTL equal to *60 seconds*.\n\nThe L2 Caching module currently doesn't support bypass cache. You can [configure a Bypass Cache rule](/en/documentation/products/guides/edge-caching/#bypass-cache) for caching at Azion, but applications with active L2 cache settings will continue to keep caching in that layer for the specified TTL.\n\nWhenever necessary, you can use **Real-Time Purge** to expire your L2 Caching content before the expected TTL time. Remember to purge first in L2 and only later in **Edge Caching**. This avoids edge feedback with outdated L2 content.\n\n> **Warning**: the **Honor Origin** setting isn't available for CDN Cache. You need to set a TTL to overwrite the CDN cache.\n\n---\n\n## Slice Settings\n\n**Slice** is a feature for Edge Applications that processes large amounts of data more effectively, reducing latency and saving bandwidth.\n\nWhen enabling this functionality, large files are fragmented into smaller ones. These fragments are gradually delivered to the end user according to data consumption, avoiding an abrupt data transfer that could be interrupted by the user. The Slice functionality caches data on demand at the moment the user requests it, initiating the cache operation.\n\n> **Note**: when activating the Slice functionality, the current *cache key* will be ignored and a new one will be created.\n\nThis feature works with a default *slice-range* of *1024kB*. If you want to modify the *slice-range*, [contact our Sales team](https://www.azion.com/en/contact-sales/).\n\nSlice can be applied to both the edge caching layer or the L2, provided that L2 Caching is an active module.\n\n---\n\n## Caching HTTP Methods \n\nBy default, Azion only caches GET and HEAD requests. To enable the OPTIONS method, you must activate the **Cache Options** button within your **Edge Application** settings in **RTM**.\n\nThe HTTP cache stores a response linked to a request and reuses it for subsequent requests.\n\nYou can enable the **Enable caching for POST** switch, allowing Azion to cache POST requests; the **Enable caching for OPTIONS** key allows Azion to cache OPTIONS requests. These two cache options imply using the request body as part of the cache key.\n\n> To enable the **Cache OPTIONS** or the **Cache POST** feature, you must activate the [Application Acceleration](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/application-acceleration/) product.\n\n---\n\n## Stale Cache \n\nWhen your application's cache passes its expiration date, it becomes *stale* (obsolete) and the server searches the source for the most up-to-date version. This new version, with an updated expiration date, overwrites the old one (*stale*).\n\nHowever, the server may encounter problems and be unable to get the most up-to-date version of your application from the origin. In such cases, it delivers the latest version of it, even though it has expired. This behavior is known as **Stale Cache**.\n\nStale Cache is a standard configuration of the **Edge Caching** module. However, if your **Edge Application** needs, you can turn it off.\n\n> **Warning**: it's important to remember that when disabling Stale Cache, if the server is unable to update the cache from the origin, it'll return an error to the user, interrupting the session.\n\n---\n\n## Advanced Cache Key \n\nYou can use Azion to deliver your dynamic or static content. Even the dynamic part of a website can often be cached for a user profile, grouped according to the specific needs of your application, such as city, browsing profile, or shopping profile.\n\nSee the documentation on the [Advanced Cache Key](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/application-acceleration/#advanced-cache-key) feature from the **Application Acceleration** for more details on this configuration.\n\n---\n\n## Adaptive Delivery \n\nThe **Adaptive Delivery** feature detects device groups you have created using the [Device Groups](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/device-groups/) capability, allowing you to configure how Azion delivers your content.\n\n- **Content does not vary by Device Groups (Improves Caching)**: choose this option to deliver the same version of the content, regardless of device detection.\n\n- **Content varies by some Device Groups (Allowed rules)**: choose this option so that Azion keeps device-based variations of its objects in the cache.\n",

    "body": "\nAzion **Edge Functions** allows you to create event-driven, serverless applications, at the edge of the network, closer to users.\n\nWith Edge Functions, you can perform serverless functions in response to events on edge nodes of our network with no need of having or managing servers.\n\nExplore how to use and get the most out of Edge Functions as follows.\n\n---\n\n## About Edge Functions\n\nHere are some of the solutions provided by Azion **Edge Functions**.\n\nYou can use functions to handle HTTP in the following Request and Response phases:\n\n- As soon as a user's requests are received in the *Edge Node* (Viewer Request).\n- Before the Azion *Edge Node* forwards the Request to the Origin (Origin Request).\n- As soon as the *Edge Node* gets the response from the Origin (Origin Response).\n- Before the Azion *Edge Node* forwards the response to the user (Viewer Response).\n\nYou can also generate responses without necessarily having to forward the request to the origin.\n\nBy using Edge Functions on your **Edge Application**, you can create a variety of solutions, for example:\n\n- Inspect cookies to rewrite URLs to different versions of a site for A/B testing.\n- Send different objects to your users based on the User-Agent header, which contains information about the device that submitted the request. For example, you can send images in different resolutions to users based on their devices.\n- Inspect headers or authorized tokens, inserting a corresponding header and allowing access control before forwarding a request to the origin.\n- Add, delete, and modify headers and rewrite the URL path to direct users to different cache objects.\n- Generate new HTTP responses to do things like redirect unauthenticated users to login pages or create and deliver static webpages right from the edge.\n\nSee more ways of using Edge Functions [in Guides](/en/documentation/products/guides/).\n\n---\n\n## How it works\n\nYou can create custom functions or use any of the existing ones provided by Azion, both for **Edge Application** and **Edge Firewall**.\n\nThe language currently supported by the platform is JavaScript.\n\n**Edge Functions** run during the handling of the request and Azion Edge Computing Platform provides a **Rules Engine** model that can trigger the execution of the Edge Functions code according to the handling phases.\n\nThe language-specific Runtime provides a programming interface for interacting and manipulating Request and Response objects to implement the necessary logic.\n\nWhen instantiating an edge function, you can enter parameters that will be passed on to the function, in [JSON](https://www.json.org/) format, through arguments. You can also define and run tests online to validate its construction.\n\nEdge Functions are performed directly on Azion Edge Infrastructure. To use them, they just need to be associated to a *Behavior* in the Rules Engine. Thus, when a request meets the criteria defined in the **Rule Engine** rules, the edge function will be triggered.\n\n---\n\n## Basics\n\nYou can create **Edge Functions** and maintain a repository of functions that can be used in **Edge Application** or **Edge Firewall**. Consult the [Runtime API](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-functions/runtime-apis/javascript/) according to the Runtime chosen for writing the edge function.\n\nIn addition to customizing your own functions, you can also choose from the ready-to-use ones provided by Azion or Independent Software Vendors (ISV). Browse the [Azion Marketplace](/en/documentation/products/marketplace/) catalog on **Real-Time Manager (RTM)**.\n\n### JavaScript Runtime Environment\n\nBy using the *JavaScript Runtime Environment*, Edge Functions written by the user go directly into effect without undergoing an internal review because the code runs on limited to isolated resources.\n\nYou can modify a function's behavior without changing the code itself. This means you don't need to hard-code the function. In the *Arguments (Args)* tab, you can insert `JSON` parameters by internal code functions. This format allows you to designate variable alternatives to your code that can contain details about a function and request.\n\n*Arguments* are dynamic values that can change the Edge Functions running at the *edge nodes*.\n\nYou can use the same function in different Edge Applications.\n\nFor example, if you build an edge function with an argument that controls whether the code needs to send data to *Amazon S3 bucket*, and in a particular edge application you determine `true`, at the *Functions Instance*, in the *Args*, the function will generate a post for an S3 so the results of the request are kept.\n\n- **Structure**: arguments are always `JSON` structures that will be stored in a function configuration through the *Args* tab in the functions module.\n- **Instantiating**: in order to instantiate Args, use `event.args.<ARG_CREATED>`. By using this command you will be able to connect to the Args tab to your code. See our [examples page](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-functions/javascript-examples/using-args/).\n\n### Edge Functions Instances\n\nAccording to its initiator type, before associating an execution trigger with Edge Function, it must be instantiated in Edge Application or Edge Firewall. With the Edge Functions module enabled, you can instantiate your edge functions for later use in a **Rules Engine Rule**, through the **Functions** tab.\n\nLearn more about **Edge Functions Instances** in the [Edge Application](/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-functions-instances/) and [Edge Firewall](/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-functions-instances/) documentation.\n\n### Edge Functions Metrics\n\nWe provide real-time information about the performance of your Edge Functions through **RTM**.\n\nTo access the graphs, follow these steps:\n\n1. Log in to [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/).\n2. Select **Products menu** > **Real-Time Metrics**.\n3. Select the Edge Functions and the **Time Range** you want to analyze. Click on the **Filter** button.\n4. You'll get the total number of invocations per instance of Edge Functions from Edge Firewall, for example.\n\nRead the [Real-Time Metrics](/en/documentation/products/real-time-metrics/) documentation to learn more about this product.\n\n---\n\n## Step-by-step: creating an Edge Function\n\nTo see your **Edge Function** in effective operation you just need to write, instantiate, and associate it with a Behavior *Run Function*, using a Rule in the **Rules Engine**. \n\n1. Log into the [**RTM**](https://manager.azion.com/). On the *Products Menu*, click **Edge Functions**.\n2. Click **Add Function** to add a new Edge Function.\n3. Name your function in the **Edge Function Name** field to be able to save your settings.\n4. In *Language*, select **JavaScript**. Copy the following example to the *Code* tab field.\n\n```js\nasync function handleRequest(request) {\n return new Response(\"Hello World!\",\n   {\n       status:200\n   })\n}\naddEventListener(\"fetch\", event => {\n event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))\n})\n```\n\n1. In the *Function to run* field, enter the name of the main function to run in the source code.\n2. Select the *Initiator Type*, which refers to the type of module where the function will be instantiated and executed.  In this example, it refers to **Edge Application**.\n3. Click on **Save** to save your settings. You return to the Edge Functions home page, where you see your list of Edge Functions.\n4. Then, access the **Products** menu, on the top left. Select an Edge Application from your list.\n5. On the *Main Settings* tab, enable the Edge Functions module in the *Edge Application Modules* section.\n6. On the *Rules Engine* tab, create or edit a Rule and in the *Behavior* section, in the *Then* field, select **Run Function** and associate it to the desired Edge Function.\n7. Example of response when running the Behavior *Run Function*:\n\n   `Hello World!`\n\n\n\n1. Use **Real-Time Metrics** to check on your metrics. For example, when you want to see the number of *Invocations of Edge Functions instances*.\n\n> Fields marked with an asterisk are required.\n\n---\n\n## Edge Functions with multiple files\n\n**Edge Functions** work with a single JavaScript (`.js`) file. In case your Edge Functions has more than one file or uses JavaScript modules, you'll need to bundle those files. \n\nOne of the ways to proceed is to use [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), which allows you to bundle JavaScript files into a single file.\n\n> Only JavaScript files are supported.\n\n> We don't support Node/Deno API native, so your code must solve all dependencies.\n\nLearn more about [Azion's Runtime API](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-functions/runtime-apis/javascript/).\n\nExample:\n\nIf you have an **Edge Function** that has a module to fetch data:\n\n- The `index.js` has the event listener and imports modules.\n- The modules folder has all `modules` that are required by your function.\n- The `webpack.config.js` has the configuration of how to bundle your function.\n\n### Requirements\n\n- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org).\n- [webpack-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-cli).\n\n### Bundle and Upload\n\nAfter you code your function, you need to bundle it using the following command:\n\n`webpack-cli --config webpack.config.js`\n\nIt will generate a directory called `dist` with a single file called `main.js`. You need to copy the content of this file and paste it into the [RTM](https://manager.azion.com/).\n\n- File structure:\n\n```\nyour_function/\n  \tmodules/\n  \t\tdata.js\n  \tindex.js\n  \twebpack.config.js\n```\n\n- Content:\n\n`index.js`\n\n```js\nimport fetchData from \"./modules/data\"\n \naddEventListener(\"fetch\", (event) => {\n   event.respondWith(fetchData())\n})\n```\n\n- `modules/data.js`:\n\n```js\nasync function fetchData() {\n   let data = await fetch(\"https://httpbin.org/get?username=azionuser&name=Azion&last_login=2021-03-10\")\n   let json = await data.json()\n   return new Response(JSON.stringify(json[\"args\"]), {\"status\": 200})\n}\n \nexport default fetchData\n```\n\n- `webpack.config.js`:\n\nThe target must be \"webworker\" and the mode must be \"production\".\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n target: \"webworker\",\n entry: \"./index.js\",\n mode: \"production\",\n}\n```\n### Generated file\n\n- `dist/main.js`:\n\n```js\n(()=>{\"use strict\";addEventListener(\"fetch\",(t=>{t.respondWith(async function(){let t=await fetch(\"https://httpbin.org/get?username=azionuser&name=Azion&last_login=2021-03-10\"),e=await t.json();return new Response(JSON.stringify(e.args),{status:200})}())}))})();\n```\n\n---\n\n## Activating your Settings\n\nYou will find the following buttons at the bottom of the screen:\n\n- **Active:** this option enables or disables your settings on the system.\n- **Cancel:** with this option, you return to the  Edge Functions home page, also discard your edits.\n- **Save:** once your selections are complete, click on **Save** to save your settings.\n\nWhen you save your settings, you return to the **Edge Functions** home page, where you see your list of Edge Functions sorted by these options: *name*, *language*, *initiator type*, *last editor*, *last modified,* *ref. count*, and *active*. By clicking on the arrows on those tabs, you can also change how your list is displayed.\n",

    "body": "\n**Error Responses** is an Azion **Edge Application** capability that allows you to customize error pages for users based on the status code received from the origin.\n\n---\n\n## How it works\n\nWhen a user requests content from an edge application, Azion sends the request to the origin servers. As a response, the origin sends back an HTTP status code, which indicates whether or not the request has been completed.\n\nHTTP status codes are three-digit numbers, grouped into five categories:\n\n* Informational responses (1xx): the connection status or progress before completing the request.\n* Successful responses (2xx): the request was successfully received, understood, accepted, and processed by the origin.\n* Redirection messages (3xx): in order to fulfill the request, there must be a redirect.\n* Client error responses (4xx): the request couldn't be completed due to an apparent error on the client's side.\n* Server error responses (5xx): the server is unable to process the request.\n\n> See the [specifications on HTTP status codes](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9110.html#overview.of.status.codes) for more information on HTTP statuses.\n\nWith **Error Responses**, you can customize how your application will handle *Client (4xx)* and *Server (5xx)* error types. This way, when a request is made to a URL that can't be found at the origin or when the server is unable to respond, the user will be redirected to a custom error page, whose contents can be cached.\n\n> Read the guide [How to customize an error response page](/en/documentation/products/guides/customizing-error-response-page/) for more instructions about how to use this feature.\n\n| Field | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Status Code | Code Azion receives when connecting to the origin. |\n| Error Caching | Defines the time in seconds that the error page will remain in cache before it's refreshed.<br /><br />Since an error page is often static and doesn't change frequently, Azion recommends high value cache times. That way, you can optimize your application's performance and reduce the cost of processing at the origin. |\n| URI | Path to the file (usually HTML) with the content of the error page that will be delivered. Example: `/404.html` |\n| Custom Status Code | Status code that will be delivered to the user instead of the original one. Example: `404` |\n| Set Origin | The origin in which the URI file is located. |\n\n---\n\n## Available error status codes\n\n| Status Code | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| 400: Bad Request | Request error caused by invalid parameters, missing required parameters, or others. |\n| 401: Unauthorized | Error resulting from a lack of the `Authentication` HTTP header. |\n| 403: Forbidden | Lack of user permissions to execute the operation. |\n| 404: Not Found | The resource requested doesn't exist. |\n| 405: Method Not Allowed | The requested method can't be applied to the URL. |\n| 406: Not Acceptable | `Accept` header wasn't found in the HTTP request or header contains content whose formatting or version isn't supported by the API. |\n| 408: Request Timeout | The server informs that the request is coming in slower than the server is prepared to wait. This means the server would like to terminate the connection.<br /><br />This response is often used since some browsers, like Chrome, Firefox 27+, or IE9, use HTTP pre-connection to speed up navigation. Also, some servers take down the connection without sending this message. |\n| 409: Conflict | Conflict in the execution of the request, such as creating an existing registry. |\n| 410: Gone | This response is sent when the requested content was permanently deleted from the server, without a preset redirect address. If this error happens, any caches or links to this resource should be removed.<br /><br />The HTTP specification describes that this code should be used for \"limited promotional services\". APIs shouldn't be made to indicate which resources were removed with this status code. |\n| 411: Length Required | The server has rejected the request because the header `Content-Length` is undefined but required by the server. |\n| 414: URI Too Long | The requested URI is larger than the server's limits. |\n| 415: Unsupported Media Type | The media format of the requested data is unsupported by the server, so the server rejects it. |\n| 416: Request Range Not Satisfiable | The value specified by the `Range` header couldn't be filled; it's likely that it's out of range of the target URI data. |\n| 426: Upgrade Required | The server refuses to execute the requisition using the current protocol, but it'll be ready to do so after the client updates to a different protocol. The server sends an `Upgrade` header response to indicate the required protocols. |\n| 429: Too Many Requests | The request was temporarily rejected for exceeding operation limits. The client must wait until the moment defined in the `X-Ratelimit-Reset` and try again. |\n| 431: Request Header Fields Too Large | The request's headers are too long or too many cookies were sent in the request. |\n| 500: Internal Server Error | Unintentional error, fault unidentified in the processing of the request. |\n| 501: Not Implemented | The request method is unsupported by the server and can't be modified. The only methods required for servers to support (and thus shouldn't return this code) are GET and HEAD. |\n| 502: Bad Gateway | This error response means that the server, working as a gateway in order to obtain a necessary response to manipulate the request, obtained an invalid response. |\n| 503: Service Unavailable | The server isn't ready to handle the request. Common causes are an overloaded server or a server under maintenance. Next to this response, a friendly page explaining the problem should be sent.<br /><br />These responses should be used for temporary conditions and the `Retry-After` header should contain the estimated time to recover the service. The webmaster should also be careful with the caching related headers that are sent with this response, since these temporary condition responses shouldn't normally be cached. |\n| 504: Gateway Timeout | This error response is sent when the server is acting as a gateway and doesn't obtain a response in time. |\n| 505: HTTP Version Not Supported | The HTTP version used in the request isn't supported by the server. |\n",

    "body": "\n**Image Processor** is an **Edge Application** module that can apply filters to your images, as well as process them without any noticeable loss of visual quality. With Image Processor, you can speed up the transfer time of your content and improve user experience in your applications.\n\n---\n\n## Instructions\n\nThis module supports the following image formats:\n\n- JPEG\n- GIF\n- PNG\n- BMP\n- ICO\n- WEBP (for [compatible browsers](https://caniuse.com/%23search=webp))\n\n**To configure this module, follow the steps below:**\n\n1. Access [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/).\n2. On the upper-left corner of the page, select **Products menu** > **Edge Application**.\n3. Select the **Edge Application** that is responsible for managing your images from your list of existing applications or add a new one with the help of our [getting started](/en/documentation/products/getting-started/) guide.\n4. In the **Cache Settings** tab, add or edit a custom cache policy for your images.\n5. In the **Expiration Settings** section, configure the expiration policy for your images in [Edge Caching](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-caching/).\n\n    > **Tip**: for images, Azion recommends that you choose a larger time-to-live (TTL) values, such as the **Maximum TTL** for the **CDN Cache**, which is 7.776.000 seconds (3 months).\n\n6. In the **Advanced Cache Key** section, choose one of the following options:\n\n    - **Content varies by some Query String fields (Whitelist):** if you want to list all the fields in the Query String that will identify your images. **Image Processor** uses the *ims* field, so this has to be included in the list as one of the required fields for your image manager application. For this, you must enable the [Application Acceleration module](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/application-acceleration/).\n    - **Content varies by Query String, except for some fields (Blacklist):** if you only want to list those fields in the Query String that should be ignored to identify the objects in your cache. In this case, it guarantees that the *ims* field will be removed from the list. For this, you must enable the [Application Acceleration module](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/application-acceleration/).\n    - **Content varies by all Query String fields:** if you don’t know or aren’t sure about which fields to list in the Query String because you aren’t responsible for all the content in the cache or don't have the [Application Acceleration module](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/application-acceleration/) activated.\n\n7. Edit the remaining settings as required and click the **Save** button to save your cache setting.\n8. In the **Rules Engine** tab for the **Edge Application**, add or edit a custom rule for one or more image paths.\n9. In the **Path** field, enter the path for your images or use the *regex* recommended by Azion:\n\n    > If you select the parameter `$ {request_uri}`, use the regex below:\n\n    ```\n    \\.(jpg|jpeg|gif|bmp|png)\n    ```\n\n    > If you select the parameter `$ {uri}`, use the *regex* below:\n\n    ```\n    \\.(jpg|jpeg|gif|bmp|png)$\n    ```\n\n10. If you used the regular expression in the **Path** field, choose the logical operator **Matches**.\n11. In the **Behavior** > **Set Cache Settings** field, select the preset used in Stage 2.\n12. Also select **Optimize Images** in the **Behavior** field.\n13. Click the **Save** button to save your rule.\n\nFrom this point on, images from the configured path will be automatically processed. In addition, the **Image Processor** detects the browser's compatibility with WEBP format and, when possible, will convert the image format automatically. BMP images will also be automatically converted to JPEG or WEBP, depending on the browser's compatibility.\n\nFollow the *Bandwidth Saving* graph through [Real-Time Metrics](/en/documentation/products/real-time-metrics/) to monitor the traffic savings resulting from the processed images.\n\n---\n\n## Resizing the image with auto-crop\n\nStarting with an original image from your library, the **Image Processor** can create derived images on demand, in the size that best suits your page.\n\nYou can specify the required size as arguments in the Query String in the following structure:\n\n```\nims=WidthxHeight\n```\n\nReplace `Width` and `Height` with the cropped image dimensions in pixels.\n\nTo resize the image while preserving the aspect ratio, delete one of the two values, which will be calculated automatically. Use `Widthx` to specify only the width and calculate the corresponding height, or `xHeight` to specify only the height and calculate the corresponding width.\n\nYou can also specify both dimensions, `Width` and `Height`, and auto-crop the image to the required size. The cropping is centered and can be either vertical or horizontal, depending on how well the original dimensions fit the specified dimensions.\n\nUse the value `orig` for any of the image dimensions, if you want to keep the original dimension.\n\n**Example:**\n\n`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=880x`\n(880 pixels in width, automatic height)\n\n[![Image_Processor_1](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=880x)](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=880x)\n\n`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=880xorig`\n(880 pixels in width, original height)\n\n[![Image_Processor_2](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_2.png)](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_2.png)\n\n`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=400x`\n(400 pixels in width, automatic height)\n\n[![Image_Processor_1](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=400x)](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_2.png?ims=400x)\n\n`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=400x400`\n(400 pixels in width, 400 pixels in height)\n\n[![Image_Processor_1](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=400x400)](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=400x400)\n\n`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=x100`\n(automatic width, 100 pixels in height)\n\n[![Image_Processor_1](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=x100)](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=x100)\n\n---\n\n## Resizing the image with fit-in \n\nAnother way to resize an image is using fit-in:\n\n```\nims=fit-in/WidthxHeight\n```\n\nReplace `Width` and `Height` with the cropped image dimensions in pixels.\n\nThe derived image will be resized to fit the area specified by `WidthxHeight`. The aspect ratio of the original image is preserved, and you can hide one of the values if you wish.\n\nIf the specified area is larger than the image dimensions, the image won't be enlarged. The dimensions specified as fit-in parameters represent the maximum size limits of the area the image can occupy. One or both dimensions of the image can be smaller than its boundaries.\n\n**Example:**\n\n`https://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=fit-in/400x400`\n(maximum width of 400 pixels and maximum height of 400 pixels)\n\n[![Image_Processor_1](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=fit-in/400x400)](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=fit-in/400x400)\n\n---\n\n## Cropping the image\n\nThe image cropping can be done by entering a start point (AxB) and an endpoint (CxD), as an argument in the Query String of the image URL:\n\n```\nims=AxB:CxD\n```\n\n- `AxB` is the starting point for the crop indicates the coordinates, in pixels, of the upper-left corner of the area to be cropped.\n- `CxD` is the endpoint for the crop indicates the coordinates, in pixels, form the bottom-right corner of the area to be cropped.\n\n**Example:**\n\n`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=430x20:910x730`\n(initial coordinate at 430x20 pixels and final coordinate at 910x730 pixels)\n\n[![Image_Processor_7](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_7.png)](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_7.png)\n\n---\n\n## Changing image quality \n\nThe **Image Processor** processes your images, reducing file size and transfer time. The default quality value used is 85%, which provides optimization without any noticeable loss of visual quality.\n\nYou can set a custom quality for your images using the filter:\n\n```\nfilters:quality(Number)\n```\n\n`Number` must be a whole number between 0 and 100, which represents the level of quality you wish.\n\n**Example:**\n\n`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=filters:quality(100)`\n(100% quality)\n\n[![Image_Processor_1](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=filters:quality(100))](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=filters:quality(100))\n\n`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=filters:quality(85)`\n(85% quality)\n\n[![Image_Processor_1](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=filters:quality(85))](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=filters:quality(85))\n\n`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=filters:quality(15)`\n(15% quality)\n\n[![Image_Processor_1](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=filters:quality(15))](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=filters:quality(15))\n\n> To confirm whether your image is being optimized, [inspect the page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools) using your browser and find the corresponding path in the image. In the URL's query string, the `ims=VALUExVALUE` field corresponds to the resolution loaded on the page.\n\nThe `ims` parameter also allows you to alter optimization, quality, and sizing as needed. To see the original file, you only need to remove the query string added in the URL.\n\n> **Note**: if you insert a resolution larger than the original one, the IMS will display the image with the highest possible resolution.\n\n---\n\n## Adding a watermark to the image\n\nTo add watermarks to images using the **Image Processor**, use the following filter:\n\n```\nfilters:watermark(ImageURL,X,Y,Alpha)\n```\n\n- `ImageURL` is the URL of the image that you wish to insert as a watermark. If the URL contains parentheses, they must be coded as `%28` for “(” and `%29` for “)”.\n- `X` represents the horizontal position for the watermark's insertion. Positive numbers represent the offset, in pixels, from left edge to right edge, while negative numbers represent offset from right edge to left edge. You can use the value *center*, to center the watermark horizontally, or the value *repeat*, to fill the image horizontally with repetitions of the watermark.\n- `Y` represents the vertical position for the watermark's insertion. Positive numbers represent the offset, in pixels, from top to bottom, while negative numbers represent the offset from bottom to top. You can use the value *center*, to center the watermark vertically, or the value *repeat*, to fill the image vertically with repetitions of the watermark.\n- `Alpha` is the transparency of the watermark. It must be a number between 0 (completely opaque) and 100 (completely transparent).\n\n**Example:**\n\n`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=filters:watermark(http://yourdomain.com/watermark-image.png,-25,-10,50)`\n\n---\n\n## Converting image to another format\n\nYou can convert the image to another format using the filter:\n\n```\nfilters:format(ImageFormat)\n```\n\nWhere **ImageFormat** can be replaced by `webp`, `jpeg`, `gif` or `png`.\n\n**Example:**\n\n`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=filters:format(gif)`\n(converts a JPEG image into GIF)\n\n[![Image_Processor_1](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=filters:format(gif))](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=filters:format(gif))\n\n---\n\n## Filling Image\n\nThe **Image Processor** can also be used to create a derived image that is larger than the original, but instead of resizing it to the required size, you can fill the area with a custom color. Use the same [parameters as fit-in](#resize-with-fit-in) with the dimensions you want and the *fill* filter:\n\n```\nfilters:fill(Color)\n```\n\n`Color` is the fill color, following the nomenclature and codes specified by [hexadecimal values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors).\n\n**Example:**\n\n`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=fit-in/400x400/filters:fill(gray)`\n\n[![Image_Processor_1](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=fit-in/400x400/filters:fill(gray))](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=fit-in/400x400/filters:fill(gray))\n\n`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=fit-in/400x400/filters:fill(008080)`\n\n[![Image_Processor_1](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=fit-in/400x400/filters:fill(008080))](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=fit-in/400x400/filters:fill(008080))\n\n`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=fit-in/400x400/filters:fill(00ffff)`\n\n[![Image_Processor_1](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=fit-in/400x400/filters:fill(00ffff))](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=fit-in/400x400/filters:fill(00ffff))\n\n---\n\n## Combining filters\n\n**Image Processor** allows you to combine the filters you want by separating each of them with `:`.\n\n```\nfilters:filter1(arg1):filter2(arg2)\n```\n\nWhere **filter1(arg1)** and **filter2(arg2)** are the filters you want to apply.\n\n**Example:**\n\n`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=fit-in/400x400/filters:fill(gray):quality(100)`\n\n",

    "body": "\nAzion **Load Balancer** allows you to balance traffic to your origin data centers or cloud providers, avoid network congestion, and overload your servers.\n\n---\n\n## How it works\n\nTo achieve high levels of fault tolerance and performance, you need to ensure the availability of your content and applications even in case of incidents with your origin servers.\n\nWith Azion **Load Balancer**, you add multiple origins to your content, select the load balancing method that best suits your needs, and customize timeouts and error handling.\n\nLoad Balancer also detects failures and provides multiple algorithms that allow you to distribute the load to the available infrastructures, ensuring the best experience for your users and results for your company.\n\n## Balancing method\n\nThe balancing method defines how the load will be distributed among your origins. It can be selected as follows:\n\n| Method            | Description                                                  |\n| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Round-Robin | Defines the balancing algorithm in rotation. It takes into account the volume of requests and not the time that each origin takes to respond. Each origin will receive a load in proportion to its weight in the round robin. Slower origins may accumulate more connections in parallel. |\n| Least connections | Keeps track of the number of active connections with each origin and always sends the next request to the origin with the fewest connections. <br />Slower origins will receive fewer requests, while faster origins will be able to attend more requests sequentially. |\n| IP Hash           | Keeps track per user IP address and tries, whenever possible, to associate the same origin for each IP. |\n\n## Host header\n\nThe `Host` header is used by your origin to identify the *virtualhost* and locate your content or application. When setting up an origin in [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/), you can customize the value that must be sent by Azion in the `Host` header.\n\nIf this field is left blank, Azion will default to the same address that is set in the **Address** field. Leave the **Host Header** field blank if your origin is configured to respond to *virtualhost* by the same address that is configured in DNS.\n\nYou can fill in a custom value for the `Host` header to be sent to your origin, for instance, `www.azion.com`.\n\n> **Warning**: you must customize the `Host` header if your origin is configured to respond to a *virtualhost* at an address other than the one configured in DNS.\n\nYou can also use the `${host}` variable in the **Host Header** field to instruct the edge nodes to pass on to the origin the same `Host` header received from your visitors. Use this setting if you have multiple *virtualhosts* being replied by the same origin.\n\n## Origin Path\n\nIf you need Azion edge nodes to request your origin content in a path other than the URI, you can define an **Origin Path**. Azion will concatenate the Origin Path with the URI requested by the user.\n\n> **Note**: the Origin Path definition is optional. If not defined, only the URI will be considered.\n\nFor example, if in your origin the whole content is under the path `/secure`, even though this path isn't shown in the URL for your users, you can set the `/secure` as the **Origin Path** in your origin settings. The rest of the path will be preserved according to the user’s request.\n\n## Origin Protocol Policy\n\nAzion's delivery architecture allows you to customize the desired connection type of Edge Nodes for your source, as follows:\n\n| Connection type              | Description                                                  |\n| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Preserve HTTP/HTTPS protocol | Will keep the same connection protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) and ports used by your user when accessing your content on Azion to connect to your origin. |\n| Enforce HTTP                 | The connection between Azion's edge nodes and your origin will be through HTTP, regardless of the connection protocol - *HTTP or HTTPS* - and ports used by your user to access Azion's content. With this new option, you may customize a port to your origin in the **Address** field different from the default port (80 for HTTP), if you wish. |\n| Enforce HTTPS                | The connection between Azion's edge nodes and your origin will be through HTTPS, regardless of the connection protocol - *HTTP or HTTPS* - and ports used by your user to access Azion's content. With this new option, you may customize a port to your origin in the **Address** field different from the default port (443 for HTTPS), if you wish. |\n\n## Multiple origins\n\nYou must add multiple origins to achieve high levels of availability and prevent an incident from impacting the availability of your content and applications, according to the following options:\n\n| Option      | Description                                                  |\n| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Address     | IP address or hostname of your origin. You may customize your origin, if you defined the Origin Protocol Policy in Enforce HTTP or Enforce HTTPS, using the notation `host:port`. |\n| Weight      | You may define a weight for each origin. This weight defines the proportion of load that the origin will receive. If you set the weight of an origin to 3, for example, it will receive 3 times more load than an origin with a weight set to 1. |\n| Server Role | If the balancing method you select is Round-Robin or Least connections, you can define Server Role for each origin: Primary or Backup. The Backup origins will act and *standby* origins and only receive the load if all Primary origins fail. |\n| Active      | To remove a server from balance temporarily for maintenance, you can disable it by deselecting the **Active** switch.  At least one active origin is required for the content to be available. |\n\n## Customizing timeouts\n\nAzion **Load Balancer** will verify the origins respecting the balancing and weight methods attributed by you. If any origin returns a 404 error (Not Found), a 5xx error or takes longer than the timeouts pre-defined by Azion to respond, the other origins will be consulted before returning any error to users.\n\nThe default values for Azion **Load Balancer** timeouts are:\n\n- **Connection**: 60 seconds timeout in the connection establishments with the origin.\n- **Between Bytes**: 120 seconds timeout between bytes in a connection already established.\n",

    "body": "\nThrough **Real-Time Purge** you can instantly delete the cache of your content at Azion, using a **Cache Key** list, a **URL** list or a **Wildcard** expression that represents the objects you want to purge.\n\n---\n\n## Content update strategies\n\nWhen you update content at your origin, you must choose the best strategy for updating it in Azion's cache. The available options are expiration time, object names with version and **Real-Time Purge**.\n\nWhen configuring your cache policy, you determine the amount of time you want your objects to be cached at Azion. When you update your content at the origin, Azion can continue providing a cached copy for as much time as you have set it to be cached.\n\nWe recommend, whenever possible, that you use some versioning markup in an object name. When you update it at your origin, you can add the version in the object name, forcing each modification of your content to be treated as a new object by Azion.\n\nWith Real-Time Purge, you can instantly delete the cache of your content at Azion, from either **Edge Caching** or **L2 Caching**. This way, Azion system fetches the latest version of your content in the origin.\n\n> Whenever possible, use cache policies with long expiration time for your content, such as 1 year – setting the Maximum TTL field to 31,536,000 seconds. This way, you will be optimizing the performance of your content or application, improving the experience for your users, reducing traffic with Azion and reducing the load at your origin.\n\nTo version your objects name, you can use a sequential number, a timestamp or other mechanism that you think is most appropriate as a version markup. For example, instead of naming an image as `image.jpg`, you could name it `image_1.jpg` and, when you need to update it, change the version to `image_2.jpg`.\n\nThis way, each content update will be treated as a new object by Azion, which guarantees you the following benefits:\n\n- Allows you to control which object a request should return, even if the user has the previous version locally saved in the browser cache or in some intermediate cache. Even if Azion cache is purged, users can still access the old version of their local cache, until the expiration time elapses.\n- Versioning allows you to provide different versions of your objects to different users.\n- Simplifies the *roll∑back* process in case of problems with your update.\n\n---\n\n## Real-Time Purge\n\nBy providing a fast and predictable purge operation, Azion enables you to increase the expiration time (TTL) of your cached objects, or cache event-drive objects, improving the *offload* and performance of your content or application, and also reducing your traffic with Azion.\n\nBy using **Real-Time Purge** to manage the cache expiration of your content, you can also perform:\n\n- Dynamic content caching and API responses, without sacrificing the user experience, as Azion's Edge Caching and L2 Caching products will be updated with your latest content.\n- Better cache efficiency, ensuring greater control over how your objects are served by Azion.\n- Better and more predictable management of obsolete or outdated objects, helping your developers to build reliable, resilient and better performing solutions.\n\nIn addition, we provide two interface options for running object purge in **Edge Caching** and **L2 Caching**: via [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/) or via [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/#efd901f3-77fa-485e-899b-fd93e243ab65).\n\n| Field | Options |\n| --- | --- |\n| Layer | Edge Caching: Purge web content delivered at the Edge.<br/><br/> L2 Caching: Purge web content in the layer nearest to your origin. |\n| Purge Type | Cache Key<br/>URL<br/>Wildcard                               |\n| Arguments | `www.example.com.br/index.html`<br/>Separate arguments with a line break. |\n\nYou can remove content from both **Edge Caching** - to clean up web content that is delivered to the Edge - and **L2 Caching** - to clean up web content at the layer closest to your origin.\n\n> **Note:** All three purge options are available for the Edge Caching layer. For the L2 Caching layer, the *Wildcard* purge option is not yet available, that is, L2 Caching purge is available only through URL and Cache Key. \n\n---\n\n## Types of Purge\n\nYou can run Real-Time Purge on either the **Edge Caching** or **L2 Caching** product by entering as a parameter the  *URLs* list, a *Wildcard* expression, or the list of *Cache Keys*.\n\n| URL Purge | Cache Key Purge | Wildcard Purge |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| It's the simplest way to purge your content cache by passing a URL list of until 50 objects per request. You can't purge content cache variations with this method. | It's the most accurate way to purge your content cache by entering a cache key list of until 50 objects per request. | It's a powerful way to purge a list of objects by entering a Wildcard expression. You can use the wildcard character (`*`) in path or query string arguments. |\n\n### URL Purge\n\nIt allows you to purge cached objects by entering a list of URLs as an argument. The URL format must respect the standard: `scheme://host` or just `host`, followed or not by a `/path` and the `?query-string`. When hiding the scheme, both HTTP and HTTPS contents will be purged.\n\nA URL Purge is non-recursive, which means that only the URLs entered will be purged from the cache. The URLs are automatically converted to their respective Cache Keys, without considering any content variation in the same URL. \n\n> Content variations based on cookies, device groups, image format or others do not expire with this operation. Consider using **Cache Key Purge** or **Wildcard Purge** for these situations. \n\nThe expiration of content variations based on Query String can be run using URL Purge, since Query String is a component of the URL, as long as the arguments used for content variation are sent in the correct order in which they were presented. If you use the Query String Sort feature, either sort the arguments in the request, or consider using Cache Key Purge or Wildcard Purge as an alternative.\n\n> If you use the asterisk (`*`) character in a URL Purge request, it'll be treated as a character in the URL and not as a Wildcard.\n\nExamples of a URL Purge:\n\n- `www.yourdomain.com`\n- `static.yourdomain.com/include/site.css`\n- `static.yourdomain.com/include/site.js`\n- `dynamic.yourdomain.com/app.py?argument`\n\n### Cache Key Purge\n\nIt allows you to purge cached objects by passing a list of Cache Keys as an argument.\n\nA Cache Key is an index entry for an object in Azion's cache. The default cache key format adopted by Azion uses the *URL host* and *path* to identify objects. You can specify an advanced cache key to identify different variations of an object, based on:\n\n*   Query String or Query String Sort arguments;\n*   cookies – when using [Azion Application Acceleration](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/application-acceleration/);\n*   image format according to browser support – when using [Azion Image Processor](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/image-processor/).\n\nTo obtain the Cache Key, you must request the content using the Azion debug header `Pragma: azion-debug-cache`, for example:\n\n```\nHEAD /path HTTP/1.1 Host: yourdomain.com Pragma: azion-debug-cache\n```\n\nThe response will return an `X-Cache-Key` header with the cache key, for example:\n\n```\nX-Cache-Key: yourdomain.com/path@@\n```\n\nEach object variation is represented by a distinct cache key and is expired individually. For example, if there's an object variation per device group, each URL in each group will have a distinct Cache Key with the separator `@@` and the device group name. To purge all variations, you must search for the cache key individually for each group.\n\nExamples of Cache Key Purge:\n\n- `www.yourdomain.com/@@`\n- `www.yourdomain.com/@@Mobile`\n- `static.yourdomain.com/include/site.css`\n- `static.yourdomain.com/include/site.js`\n- `static.yourdomain.com/static/images/image_1.jpg?ims=880x@@`\n- `static.yourdomain.com/static/images/image_1.jpg?ims=880x@@webp`\n\n### Wildcard Purge\n\nIt allows you to purge cached object by giving a Wildcard expression as an argument. The Wildcard expression format must be according to the standard: `scheme://host` or just `host`, followed or not by a `/path` and the `?query-string`, with an asterisk character (`*`) in the path or query string.\n\nThe Wildcard expression is automatically converted to multiple objects in the same domain. To expire the content variations based on cookies, device groups or image format, for the same URL, use the URL with the expression `@@*` at the end. For example:\n\n- `www.yourdomain.com/*`\n- `static.yourdomain.com/include/*.css`\n- `static.yourdomain.com/*/site.js`\n- `static.yourdomain.com/static/images/image_1.jpg?ims=*`\n- `dynamic.yourdomain.com/app.py@@*`\n\nYou can even use multiple wildcards to select a complex pattern:\n\n- `www.yourdomain.com/alpha*`\n- `www.yourdomain.com/*beta*`\n- `www.yourdomain.com/*a*/charlie`\n- `www.yourdomain.com/*a*/*a*`\n- `www.yourdomain.com/*?b*`\n- `www.yourdomain.com/*?*2*c=*`\n\n---\n\n## Purge methods\n\n### Delete\n\nThe Delete method removes the object from the cache. In the next user's content request, an unconditional GET request will be made to the origin.\n\nThis purge method prevents Azion from delivering an outdated object (_stale_) if the origin is inaccessible. Instead, if the origin is inaccessible, an error page will be delivered.\n\nThe use of the Delete method is indicated for:\n\n- Removing content from Azion's cache, after it has been removed from the origin.\n- Forcing the removal and later updating of contents for which the *timestamp* is unreliable.\n- Forcing the delivery of an error page  instead of an outdated object (*stale*), if your origin is inaccessible and Azion is unable to get the latest version of your content.\n\n---\n\n## Purge objects with content variation\n\n### Application Acceleration\n\nWhen using cookie-based content variation, in addition to the *host* and *path*, the cache key will include the `@@` separator followed by the name of the cookies used and values.\n\nFor example, for the same URL `http://www.yourdomain.com/`, using content variation based on the `user` cookie, the cache keys could be:\n\n- `www.yourdomain.com/@@`\n- `www.yourdomain.com/@@user=user1`\n- `www.yourdomain.com/@@user=user2`\n\nTo purge objects with cookie-based variation, you can use Cache Key Purge, entering all variations individually, or a Wildcard Purge, using `@@*` at the end.\n\nWhen using Query String based content variation, in addition to the `host` and `path`, the cache key will include the `?` separator and the query string arguments used. For example:\n\n- `dynamic.yourdomain.com/product.py?id=1000`\n- `dynamic.yourdomain.com/product.py?id=1001`\n\nTo purge objects with variation based on query string, you can use a Cache Key Purge, entering all the variations individually, or a Wildcard Purge, using `?*` at the end, or a URL Purge, entering in the URL only the arguments used in the cache key. If you use Query String Sort, the arguments must be sent in the correct order.\n\n### Image Processor\n\nBy using Image Processor, you'll be using an advanced cache key. In addition to `host` and `path` the cache key will include the separator`?` and the product arguments, and the `@@` separator for identifying image format variation supported by the browser.\n\nExamples of cache keys using Image Processor:\n\n- `static.yourdomain.com/static/images/image.jpg@@`\n- `static.yourdomain.com/static/images/image.jpg@@webp`\n- `static.yourdomain.com/static/images/image.jpg?ims=88x@@`\n- `static.yourdomain.com/static/images/image.jpg?ims=88x@@webp`\n\nTo purge images processed by Image Processor, you can use a Cache Key Purge, entering all variations individually, or a Wildcard Purge, using `*` at the end.\n\n### Slice Configurations\n\nIf you use cache optimization to deliver large files –sliced files– such as in Progressive Download media, you will be using an advanced cache key. In addition to `host` and `path`, the cache key will include the `@@bytes=` separator for each slice of content.\n\nExamples of cache keys using optimization for delivering large files:\n\n- `static.yourdomain.com/midias/file.mp4@@bytes=0-1048575`\n- `static.yourdomain.com/midias/file.mp4@@bytes=1048576-2097151`\n\nTo purge objects using this optimization, you must use a Wildcard Purge, with `@@*` at the end. You can also use the Cache Key Purge, as long as you enter the cache key for all slices correctly.\n\nBe careful when you purge for a slice individually, because if there is a change of content at the origin, it may be inconsistent in the cache.\n\n---\n\n### POST and HTTP Method\n\nBy default, Azion allows caching of GET and HEAD methods only. You can enable the `POST` or `OPTIONS` caching in the **Cache Settings** tab, in the edge application in which you'll be using an advanced cache key. In addition to host and path, the cache key will include the @@ separator followed by the MD5 hash of the request body (`POST` arguments).\n\n#### Syntax\n\n| Example POST method | Example OPTIONS method |\n| --- | --- |\n| `dynamic.yourdomain.com/path@@md5_of_post_arguments` | `dynamic.yourdomain.com/path@@md5_of_options_arguments` |\n\nTo purge these objects, you can either use a Cache Key Purge, entering all variations individually or a Wildcard Purge, using `@@*` at the end.\n\n### Custom Configurations\n\nIf you have a Custom Configuration with a custom cache key, you must use the Cache Key Purge to delete the cache of your objects. In addition to `host` and `path`, the cache key may include the `@@` separator followed by custom arguments.\n\n`dynamic.yourdomain.com/path@@custom_arguments`\n\nYou need to refer to the custom format of your cache key to run the Cache Key Purge.\n\n---\n\n## Purge confirmation\n\nThe purge is an operation that does not require confirmation. Since the Real-Time Purge is completed almost instantly, no confirmation of the operation is required and you can expect your purges to be completed in less than 3 seconds, except in the case of consistent use of Rate Limits.\n\nWhen needed, you can query the purging history to find out the user who made the request, the time, argument list, purge type and method.\n\n---\n\n## Limits\n\nThe purge operation is performed according to the following usage limits, based on the type and number of objects that are being purged:\n\n- **URL** and **Cache Key Purges**: up to 10,000 objects every 60 seconds, up to 200 requests with 50 objects per request, per client. The URL and Cache Key are limited to 4,096 characters.\n- **Wildcard Purges**: up to 2,000 requests per day (per 24h interval), one Wildcard URL per request. The Wildcard URL is limited to 256 characters.\n- Purge history is limited to 6 months and up to 1 million requests.\n",

    "body": "\n**Rules Engine** is an [Edge Application](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/) capability that handles the conditional execution of behaviors through logical operators. By using Rules Engine, you can build an architecture that provides better performance to your users while consuming fewer resources by processing at the origin.\n\n---\n\n## How it works\n\nEach requisition made to an application built with Azion [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/) is processed in a fixed sequence of two phases: first the **Request Phase**, then the **Response Phase**.\n\nAt each processing phase, you can define a set of rules to handle the request according to the needs of your application or business. Once you have selected in which of the two phases your rule will be executed, you'll be able to create a new rule.\n\nRules are designed to follow a conditional *if-then* logic. Every rule is composed of **Criteria** (*if*) that will define the set of conditions that must be met for the execution of **Behaviors** (*then*).\n\nYou can use a set of variables, comparison operators, and logical operators to trigger the desired behaviors for your application. If the conditions are met, the behaviors of each rule are executed until all the rules are processed.\n\n> **Warning**: some behaviors can finish the execution of rules. If a sequence of rules includes such behavior, any rules or behaviors that follow the finalizing behavior won't be executed.\n\nBefore you create a rule, you should enable the [Application Acceleration](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/application-acceleration/) module, which extends the usability of **Rules Engine** by applying serverless computing features to **Edge Application**. If the module is disabled, only some variables and Behaviors will be available for your rule.\n\n> See [Creating rules using Rules Engine for Edge Application](/en/documentation/products/guides/static-sites-on-edge/) for a step-by-step guide on how to use Rules Engine.\n\n---\n\n## Processing phases\n\nWhen creating a rule, you'll be prompted to select one of the two available processing phases: **Request Phase** or **Response Phase**.\n\n### Request Phase\n\nIn the **Request Phase**, you can handle your user’s request according to your business rules and define which origins should handle the request in case the requested content isn't cached.\n\nYou can use any variable related to the data sent by your user in the request as variables for Request Phase rules. As the response hasn't been processed by your application yet, you don't have access to variables related to the content that will be delivered to your user in this phase.\n\nYou also define how Azion should manage your application’s cache in the Request Phase. If your application doesn't allow any type of cache, you can define the conditions to ignore caching.\n\n### Response Phase\n\nIn the **Response Phase**, your application handles what will be delivered to your users. All handling processed in the Response Phase is dynamic and will be performed individually for each user.\n\n---\n\n## Description\n\nAside from the name of the rule, you can add a description to your rule using the **Description** field. Your description will be visible from the rule list and can be used to help you identify what the rule does.\n\n---\n\n## Criteria\n\nThe **Criteria** section of **Rules Engine** is where you define the conditions for executing the rule.Criteria are composed of:\n\n- variables\n- comparison operators\n- arguments, when applicable\n\nThe inclusion of arguments in a criteria depends on the comparison operators chosen. The format of the arguments is described in the [variables](#variables) and [comparison operators](#comparison-operators) sections below. You can also add [logical operators](#logical-operators) to increase the amount of comparisons that the rule will execute.\n\nFor example, this criteria identifies whether a user is accessing your application via a desktop web browser using a regular expression as an argument:\n\n|  | Variable  | Comparison operator | Argument |\n| --- | ---- | --- | --- |\n| If | `${http_user_agent}` | *matches* | `(Chrome|Mozilla)` |\n\n### Variables\n\n| Variable | Description | Phase |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `${arg_name}` | The name argument sent by the user on the request line (query string). For example: for the GET `/path?Search=test` request, the variable will assume the value `test`. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |\n| `${args}` | All arguments sent by the user in the request string (query string). For example: for the GET `/path?Search=test` request, the variable will assume the value `Search=test`. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |\n| `${cookie_name}` | Value of the cookie name. For example, for `cookie_icl_current_language = pt-br`, the variable `${cookie_icl_current_language}` will assume the value `pt-br`. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |\n| `${device_group}` | User device group. You can customize your [device groups](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/device-groups/) in the **Device Groups** tab of your application in Real-Time Manager. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |\n| `${domain}` | Similar to the `${host}` variable. Stores the host name or the Host header from the request, excluding the last subdomain after the second-level domain. For example, for a domain `az.blog.domain.com`, this variable carries the value `blog.domain.com`. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |\n| `${geoip_city}` | Name of the city, using the geolocation base `geoip_city`. For example: `Sao Paulo`, `London`. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |\n| `${geoip_city_continent_code}` | 2-letter continent code, using the geolocation base `geoip_city`. For example: `EU` for Europe, `NA` for North America. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |\n| `${geoip_city_country_code}` | 2-letter country code, using the geolocation base `geoip_city`. For example: `RU` for Russia, `BR` for Brazil. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |\n| `${geoip_city_country_name}` | Name of the country, using the geolocation base `geoip_city`. For example: `United States`, `Brazil`. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |\n| `${geoip_continent_code}` | 2-letter continent code. For example: `EU` for Europe, `NA` for North America. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |\n| `${geoip_country_code}` | 2-letter country code, using the geolocation base `geoip_country`. For example: `RU` for Russia, `BR` for Brazil. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |\n| `${geoip_country_name}` | Name of the country, using the geolocation base `geoip_country`. For example: `United States`, `Brazil`. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |\n| `${geoip_region_name}` | Name of the country, using the geolocation base `geoip_region`. For example: `Ontario`, `Sao Paulo`. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |\n| `${geoip_region}` | 2-letter region code. For example: `RS` for Rio Grande do Sul, `ON` for Toronto. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |\n| `${host}` | In order of precedence: the host name of the request line, or the value of the Host header field of the request, or the name of the server serving the request. For example: `blog.domain.com`. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |\n| `${http_name}` | The value of a request header. `name` must be a valid [HTTP request header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Request_header) converted to lowercase; hyphens must be converted to underscore. For example: `${http_accept}` will take the value of the `Accept` header of the HTTP request field. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |\n| `${remote_addr}` | The IP address of the client performing the HTTP request. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |\n| `${remote_user}` | The username provided by basic authentication, if any. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |\n| `${request}` | Complete request query. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |\n| `${request_method}` | The HTTP method of the request. For example: `GET`. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |\n| `${request_uri}` | The complete URI of the request, with arguments (query string). | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |\n| `${scheme}` | The scheme of the request. For example: `http` or `https`. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |\n| `${sent_http_name}` | The value of the response header field name. The name argument must be converted to lowercase and the hyphens must be converted to underscore. For example: `${sent_http_content_length}` will take the value of the Content-Length header. | Response Phase |\n| `${status}` | Status code of the response. | Response Phase |\n| `${upstream_addr}` | The IP address and port of the queried origin for obtaining the response. If many origins are consulted during the processing of the request, the addresses will be separated by a comma. For example: `192.168.1.1:80, 192.168.1.2:80`. If an internal redirect from one group of servers to another occurs, initiated by an `X-Accel-Redirect` or an error page, the addresses of the different groups will be separated by a colon. For example: `192.168.1.1:80, 192.168.1.2:80 : 192.168.10.1:80, 192.168.10.2:80`. | Response Phase |\n| `${upstream_cookie_name}` | Value of cookie name sent by the origin using the Set-Cookie header field. If many origins are consulted while the request is processed, only cookies from the last origin are stored. | Response Phase |\n| `${upstream_http_name}` | Value of the name header field sent by the origin. The name argument must be converted to lowercase and the hyphens must be converted to underscore. If many origins are consulted while the request is processed, only headers from the last origin are stored. For example: `${upstream_http_server}` will assume the value of the Server header field sent by the last queried origin. | Response Phase |\n| `${upstream_status}` | Status code of the origin response sent to RTM. If many origins are consulted while the request is processed, the status codes will be separated by a comma. If an internal redirect from one group of servers to another is initiated by an `X-Accel-Redirect` or an error page, the status codes of the different groups will be separated by a colon. | Response Phase |\n| `${uri}` | The normalized (urldecoded) URI of the request. The value of `${uri}` can change during the processing of a request, for example, when an internal redirect occurs or when index files are used. For query string parameters, use `${request_uri}`. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |\n\n### Comparison Operators\n\n| Operator | Description | Argument type |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| is equal | The value of the variable is exactly the same as the argument. | string |\n| is not equal | The value of the variable isn't the same as the argument. | string |\n| starts with | The value of the variable starts with the argument. | string |\n| does not start with | The value of the variable doesn't start with the argument. | string |\n| matches | The value of the variable matches the regular expression entered as an argument. | regular expression |\n| does not match | The value of the variable doesn't match the regular expression entered as an argument. | regular expression |\n| exists | The variable has a defined value. For example: `${arg_search}` exists if a search argument was sent in the request query string. | - |\n| does not exist | The variable doesn't have a defined value. For example: `${arg_search}` doesn't exist if a search argument wasn't sent in the request query string. | - |\n\n### Logical Operators\n\nMultiple criteria can be defined using the logical operators **AND** and **OR**. Each rule can have up to 10 criteria.\n\nThe operator **AND** has implicit precedence over the operator **OR**. If explicit precedence is required, you can add more criteria groups using the **AND** operator only.\n\n---\n\n## Behaviors\n\nIn the **Behaviors** section of the **Rules Engine**, you must add the behaviors you want your rule to perform if the conditions defined in the criteria are met.\n\nFor example, this behavior redirects the user to an English version of an FAQ location:\n\n|  Behavior  | Argument |\n| --- | --- |\n| Redirect To (302 Found) | `/en-us/faq` |\n\nEach rule can perform up to 10 behaviors.\n\nEach behavior has its own set of requirements, described in the table below.\n\n| Behavior | Description | Phase | Requirements |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Add Request Cookie | Adds a cookie in the `Set-Cookie` request header. The cookie must be inputted as an argument in the format `cookie-name=cookie-value`. <br />You may use a variable as a cookie value, for example: `cookie-name=${arg_cookie}`. | Request Phase | [Application Acceleration](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/application-acceleration/) |\n| Add Response Cookie | Adds a cookie and policies in the `Set-Cookie` response header. The cookie must be inputted as an argument in the format `cookie-name=cookie-value`.<br />For response cookies, the following [Set-Cookie policies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie) can be added to the argument, following the cookie value and a semicolon (`;`):<br /><li>`Expires=date` (EEE, d MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss Z)</li><li>`Domain=domain-value`</li><li>`Path=path-value`</li><li>`Max-age=number` (TTL in seconds, takes precedence over `Expires`)</li><li>`SameSite=value; Secure`</li><li>`HttpOnly`</li><br />Multiple policies for the same cookie can be separated by semicolons (`;`). For example: `cookie-name=cookie-value; Domain=domain-value; Path=path-value; SameSite=value`.<br />You may also use variables as a cookie or policy value, for example: `Path=${uri}; Domain=${host}`. | Response Phase | [Application Acceleration](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/application-acceleration/) |\n| Add Request Header | Adds a header field to the request that will be sent to the origin. The header field must be informed as an argument in the format `Field:value` | Request Phase | - |\n| Add Response Header | Adds a header field to the response that will be sent to the user. The header field must be informed as an argument in the format `Field: value`. | Response Phase | - |\n| Bypass Cache | Defines that Azion shouldn't cache the response from its origin. The execution of this rule has no impact on the cache in the users’ browser, which must be defined using the *Set Cache Policy* behavior. | Request Phase | [Application Acceleration](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/application-acceleration/) |\n| Capture Match Groups | Support behavior for handling strings. Stores in a temporary variable the result of capturing correspondence groups defined by a regex applied to one of the available HTTP request fields. This temporary variable can be referenced later in the behavior *Rewrite Request* to assemble the rewrite string.<br />This behavior requires three arguments:<br />*captured array name*: the name you want to give the temporary variable where the array of captured strings will be stored.<br />*subject*: the HTTP request field where you want to capture a string.<br />*regex*: the regular expression used to capture the strings. Each captured group must be represented in parentheses.<br /><br />For example, to capture the path and name of a file in an HTTP request, you could use:<br />*captured array name:* `capture`<br />*subject:* `${uri}`<br />*regex:* `^(./)([^/])$`<br /><br />You may reference the capture variable as an array by using the notation `%{variable[index]}`. Because it's a local variable, you can only use it within the same rule you are setting up. In this example, if the URI is `/path/image.jpg`, the capture variable will have the following values:<br />`%{capture[0]} = “/path/image.jpg”`<br />`%{capture[1]} = “/path/”`<br />`%{capture[2]} = “image.jpg”`<br /><br />You can also name the indexes to reference them using names instead of a numeric index. To do so, use the `?&lt;name&gt;` notation as in the example:<br />*captured array name:* `capture`<br />*subject:* `${uri}`<br />*regex:* `^(?<path>.*/)(?<filename>[^/]*)$` | Request Phase | [Application Acceleration](/documentation/products/edge-application/application-acceleration/) |\n| Deliver | Finishes processing the request and delivers the content to the user, without executing any of the rules added later. You are forcing the processing to end immediately. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase | - |\n| Deny (403 Forbidden) | Delivers a *403 Forbidden* page to the user. Ends the request processing. | Request Phase | - |\n| Enable Gzip | Enables Gzip data compression, if supported by the user’s browser. See the guide on [How to enable gzip compression](/en/documentation/products/guides/using-gzip-mime-types/) for more information. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase | - |\n| Enable Sliced Files | Enables segmentation of large objects into 1MB slices, if their origin supports HTTP range requests. You can use this behavior to optimize the performance of your website or application; if you deliver media larger than 1MB through the CDN so that the content reaches users before Azion has received the entire object from its origin.<br /><br />When activating this functionality, Azion will request the objects for their origin via range requests and they'll be cached in Azion with [Advanced Cache Key](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-caching/#advanced-cache-key).<br /><br />If your origin doesn't support range requests, Azion will only be able to start delivering your content to its users after your origin has completed the complete sending of the object. | Default Rule | - |\n| Enforce HLS cache | This behavior is automatically included by Azion whenever you select a Live Ingest origin. Performs two actions: the bypass of all your Cache Phase rules and the imposition of the cache policy defined by Azion for live transmissions in HTTP Live Streaming (HLS).<br /><br />Azion’s cache policy for live HLS streams is 5 seconds of cache for playlists (.m3u8) and 60 seconds of cache for chunks (.ts). | Request Phase | Live Ingest |\n| Filter Request Cookie | Removes a cookie from the request header that would be sent to the origin. As an argument, add the name of the cookie you want to remove as `cookie-name`.<br /><br />To remove only specific values, you must inform the name and value of the cookie as `cookie-name=cookie-value`. | Request Phase | [Application Acceleration](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/application-acceleration/) |\n| Filter Response Cookie | Removes a cookie from the request header that would be sent to the user. As an argument, add the name of the cookie you want to remove as `cookie-name`.<br /><br />To remove only specific values, you must inform the name and value of the cookie as `cookie-name=cookie-value`. | Response Phase | [Application Acceleration](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/application-acceleration/) |\n| Filter Request Header | Removes a request header that would be sent to the origin. The name of the header field must be entered as an argument, for example: `Header-Name`. | Request Phase | - |\n| Filter Response Header | Removes a response header that would be sent to the user. The name of the header field must be entered as an argument, for example: `Header-Name`. | Response Phase | - |\n| Forward Cookies | By using the Forward Cookies behavior, you are determining that Azion forwards to the users the Set-Cookie header received from its origin, even in a cache content situation (cache hit).<br /><br />To prevent a user from receiving another user’s `Set-Cookie` session, see the [guide on Forward Cookies](/en/documentation/products/guides/edge-caching/#forward-cookies). | Request Phase | [Application Acceleration](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/application-acceleration/) |\n| Optimize Images | Enables [Image Processor](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/image-processor/). | Request Phase | [Image Processor](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/image-processor/) |\n| Redirect HTTP to HTTPS | Redirects the HTTP request to the respective HTTPS URL. If the request is already HTTPS, it doesn't execute any behavior. | Request Phase | HTTPS application. |\n| Redirect To (301 Moved Permanently)<br /><br />Redirect To (302 Found) |These behaviors redirect the user to another URL entered as an argument, returning the status code *301 Moved Permanently* or *302 Found*.<br /><br />It is recommended that these behaviors be used for path changes; *301 Moved Permanently* for permanent changes and *302 Found* for temporary changes.<br /><br />This behavior ends the request processing.<br /><br />**Warning**: in the Response Phase, Redirect To behaviors are only executed when the origin returns a 404 error. | Request Phase <br />Response Phase | - |\n\n\n---\n\n## Functions\n\nFor behaviors that request a mandatory argument, you can use the same variables available for both processing phases. This way, you can compose cookies or HTTP headers via a Response using data collected from a Request, such as the user's device group or their geolocation.\n\nAzion also provides some functions to simplify the handling of your arguments:\n\n| Function and Argument | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `${cookie_time_offset(number)}` | Returns the current date plus an offset in seconds, entered as an argument, to be used to define the expiration time of a cookie. For example, if you want the cookie to expire in 1 hour, use the *Add Response Cookie* behavior with the argument: `cookie-name=cookie-value; Expires=${cookie_time_offset(3600)}` |\n| `${encode_base64(string)}` | Returns the arguments coded in base64.

    "body": "\nThrough **Single Origin** you may set up the address of your origin and adjust parameters.\n\n---\n\n## Single Origin Features\n\nWith **Single Origin** you add an origin for your content and customize **Host Header**, connection method and authentication credentials.\n\n### Host Header\n\nThe Host header is used by your origin to identify the *virtualhost* and locate your content or application. When setting up an origin in Real-Time Manager, you can customize the value that must be sent by Azion in the Host header.\n\nIf this field is left blank, Azion will use, by default, the same address defined in the **Address** field. Leave the **Host Header** field blank if your origin is configured to respond to *virtualhost* by the same address that is set in DNS.\n\nYou can fill in a custom value for **Host Header** to be sent to your origin. For example, *www.azion.com*. You must customize the **Host Header** if your origin is configured to respond to a *virtualhost* at an address other than the one configured in DNS.\n\nYou can also use the variable `$host` in the **Host Header** field, to instruct the edge nodes to pass on to the origin the same Host header received from your visitors. Use this setting if you multiple *virtualhosts* being replied by the same origin.\n\n### Origin Path\n\nIf you need Azion Edge Nodes to request the content of your origin in a path other than the URI, you may define an **Origin Path**. Azion will concatenate the Origin Path with the URI requested by the user.\n\nThe definition of the **Origin Path** is optional. If it is not defined, only the URI will be considered.\n\nFor example, if in your origin the whole content is under the **path** `/secure`, though this path is not shown in the URL for your users, you may define the `/secure` as the **Origin Path** in your origin settings. The rest of the path will be preserved, in accordance with the user’s request.\n\n### Origin Protocol Policy\n\nAzion’s delivery architecture allows you to customize the desired type of connection of the Edge Nodes to your origin:\n\n| Connection Type              | Description                                                  |\n| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Preserve HTTP/HTTPS protocol | It will keep the same connection protocol - *HTTP or HTTPS* - and ports used by your user when accessing your content on Azion to connect to your origin. |\n| Enforce HTTP                 | The connection between Azion’s Edge Nodes and your origin will be through HTTP, regardless of the connection protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) and ports used by your user to access Azion’s content. With this new option, you may customize a port to your origin in the **Address** field different from the default port (80 for HTTP) if you wish. |\n| Enforce HTTPS                | The connection between Azion’s Edge Nodes and your origin will be through HTTPS, regardless of the connection protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) and ports used by your user to access Azion’s content. With this new option, you may customize a port to your origin in the **Address** field different from the default port (443 for HTTPS) if you wish. |\n\n### Address\n\nAfter the definition of the fields above, add an origin informing the IP address or hostname FQDN –*Full Qualified Domain Name* - of your origin.\n\nYou may also customize the origin port, if you defined the *Origin Protocol Policy* in the *Enforce HTTP* or *Enforce HTTPS*, using the notation `host:port`.\n\n### HMAC Authentication \n\nYou may include a Single Origin where the origin is found in an Object Storage with private access, with authentication through HMAC.\n\nWhen enabling *HMAC Authentication*, your private content will begin to be delivered to your users through Edge Application.You should include in the access credentials HMAC, Region, Access Key and Secret Key provided by your Object Storage provider. \n\nSecret Key is protected by being displayed only to its users with write permission and maintaining their access security.\n\n### Timeouts \n\nDisplays timeout setting in seconds pre-defined by Azion. Timeout values cannot be customized.\n\n---\n",

This way, complex attacks on your content, applications, and Domain Name System (DNS) service can be prevented directly at the edge, even if you're still using an on-premise or cloud origin infrastructure, since mitigation will be extended to the edge regardless of whether your network is ipv4, ipv6, or hybrid.\n\n*Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Protection* is integrated into each of our edge locations. It's also connected to multiple mitigation centers around the world for effective mitigation as close as possible to the origin of the attack. As a founding participant in *MANRS* initiative led by the *Internet Society*, we strengthen network routing security by using stringent AS-path filters, thereby applying due diligence to verify customer advertisements as well as our own, and perform origin address validation for customer networks, end-users, and infrastructure to prevent IP address spoofing.\n\nWith such *Software-defined networking (SDN)* routing practices, associated with real-time network packet analysis (DPI or Deep Packet Inspection) at the edges and traffic anomaly and signature analysis algorithms for automatic attack mitigation, in addition to higher-level algorithms for the detection and mitigation of the most complex and varied types of attacks in real-time, we neutralize BGP hijacking threats and denial of service attacks (DoS and DDoS) without impacting delivery latency. \n\n**DDoS Protection** covers all products and services, including Azion **Intelligent DNS**, thus providing security and availability for address resolution.\n\nIn the best effort to non-exhaustively enumerate some mitigable attacks, we begin by classifying DDoS attacks:\n\n* **Volume-based attacks**: also known as flood attacks, this type of attack uses a form of amplification or malware and worm requests, potentially coordinated by a botnet, to create large amounts of traffic and overload a system.\n* **Protocol attacks**: also known as state exhaustion attacks, protocol attacks focus on exploiting vulnerabilities in network resources, overloading the processing of critical services and infrastructure such as security and load balancing.\n* **Application layer attacks**: also known as layer 7 attacks, this type of attack aims to make the application unavailable, affecting services such as DNS and HTTP.\n\nIn the best effort, we have listed below in a **non-exhaustive way** some DDoS attacks that can be mitigated with Azion:\n\n* Bogons\n* Botnet attacks\n* Brute force attacks\n* Connection flood attacks\n* DNS flood (including well-formed DNS Queries)\n* HTTP floods (including HTTP well-formed POST / GET URL requests)\n* HTTP Slow Reads\n* ICMP Flood\n* IGMP Flood\n* IP Bogons\n* IP Fragmentation\n* Low and Slow attacks\n* MALFORMED ICMP Flood (Ping of death)\n* MIXED Floods (TCP+UDP, ICMP+UDP, etc.)\n* Nuke\n* OWASP top 10\n* Reflected ICMP / UDP\n* Slowloris\n* Smurf\n* Spoofing\n* TCP ACK Flood\n* TCP ACK-PSH Flood\n* TCP SYN-ACK Flood\n* TCP FIN Flood\n* TCP Out of state Flood\n* TCP RESET Flood\n* TCP SYN Flood\n* TCP Fragmentation\n* TCP Invalid\n* Teardrop\n* UDP Flood\n* Zero-day attacks\n\nAs an example of detection and mitigation techniques employed, we can mention:\n\n* Allowlists, blocklists and greylists.\n* Blocking, redirecting or dropping according to HTTP headers, geolocation, among other parameters.\n* Blocking, redirecting or dropping according to reputation, network lists, etc.\n* Botnet lists, cloud providers, malware, proxies, etc.\n* Bots mitigation and management techniques.\n* Challenge-response techniques.\n* Captcha and recaptcha for identifying human users.\n* Cookie tampering.\n* Dynamic IP reputation, fingerprints, IP+user agents, etc.\n* Fingerprinting.\n* HTTP redirect.\n* Malformed packets discarding.\n* Origin access restriction for Azion IP addresses only.\n* Pattern analysis and anomaly detection.\n* Score-based blocking.\n* security token, JWT, etc.\n* Session timeout.\n* Signature/fingerprint-based blocking.\n* Simple (local) and advanced (global, contextual) rate limit.\n* Standby rules (to be used in response to incidents as they happen).\n* Techniques to prevent brute force attacks.\n\nAttack records and monitoring can be done through Azion **Real-Time Metrics** or a large number of *Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)*. In addition, they rely on market-known Big Data services that can be easily integrated with Azion.\n\nAzion applies a security-centric strategy to our products and services, providing customers with programmable and extensible zero-trust security that is always protected and visible with end-to-end encryption. \n\nWe prioritize algorithm development for automatic detection and blocking of attacks. Once a threat is identified, our *Security Response Team* tracks threats end-to-end and may come to apply customized rules to mitigate sophisticated network, transport, and application layer attacks. These rules will be instantly enforced by the real-time architecture of **Edge Firewall**, allowing you to quickly and efficiently protect your content or application. As such, we build and support, along with our customers, efficient and effective attack mitigation mechanisms.\n",

It uses advanced algorithms and Software-Defined Network (SDN) to enable granular detection and mitigation of DDoS attacks. Azion **DDoS Protection - 20Gbps, 50Gbps, and Unlimited** detects attacks such as HTTP floods, HTTP Slow Reads, DNS query floods, SYN/ACK Flood and many others.\n\n### Mitigation of complex attacks\n\nIn addition to the benefits of the standard modality, **Azion DDoS Protection - 20Gbps, 50Gbps**, and Unlimited offers more sophisticated algorithms for automated attack mitigation. Using advanced routing techniques, **DDoS Protection - 20Gbps, 50Gbps, and Unlimited** offers an additional level of automated protection against higher volume DDoS attacks.\n\nFor application layer attacks, you will need Azion **WAF** to create advanced rules to automatically block malicious requests and Azion **Edge Firewall** to configure proactive blacklist or whitelist rules for networks, geolocation or rate limit, or create standby rules to be used in response to incidents as they happen.\n\n### Protection of your infrastructure\n\nThe Infrastructure Protection add-on allows you to protect your own infrastructure (Autonomous System Number [ASN]) from DDoS attacks. The mitigation of DDoS attacks against your infrastructure is performed using Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and can be activated during an attack or it can be activated during an attack or remain always-on. To ensure security against application layer attacks, in addition to Azion **WAF** we also suggest using Azion **Origin Shield** to ensure that accesses to your infrastructure are always done through Azion.\n\n### Protection for your DNS\n\nThe **DNS Protection** add-on allows you to protect your DNS service from DDoS attacks. By keeping your DNS Master server hidden and spreading Azion's DNS servers to the internet, you will rely on Azion to ensure the continuity of your services. The Azion DNS service is distributed in different geographic regions and has protection against DDoS attacks. Azion's DNS servers get their configuration from the customer's Master server, whether it is inside their infrastructure or in the cloud. If your infrastructure already uses the [DNSSEC extension](/en/documentation/products/intelligent-dns/dnssec-compatibility), you can count on **DDoS Protection** without giving up the guarantee of integrity and authenticity of your records, thus providing security and availability for address resolution for your business.\n\n### Attack visibility\n\nAzion **DDoS Protection - 20Gbps, 50Gbps, and Unlimited** offers complete visibility of application attacks through the **Real-Time Manager** or API to be able to view the volume of attacks. In conjunction with our SRT, you will have access to post-event analysis and investigations.\n\n### Security Response Team (SRT)\n\nIf you choose the Mission Critical support plan along with **DDoS Protection Unlimited**, you will have 24×7 access to Azion's Security Response Team (SRT), which can be triggered during or after an attack or even earlier for support in building proactive rules.\n\nWhenever triggered, the SRT will assist you in tracing incidents, identifying the main cause and applying the necessary mitigations on your behalf.\n\n### Cost protection\n\n**DDoS Protection - 20Gbps, 50Gbps, and Unlimited** include Cost Protection for your Azion services, a measure to guarantee against the increase in your Azion costs resulting from a volumetric attack.\n\nIf the use of any of your Azion services expands in response to a DDoS attack, Azion will provide service credits to avoid surplus charges for peak usage.\n\n---\n\n## Modalities Comparison\n\n| Functionalities                                              | DDoS Protection - 5Gbps | DDoS Protection - 20Gbps, 50Gbps, and Unlimited              |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Network flow analysis (layers 3 and 4)                       | Yes                     | Yes                                                          |\n| Always-on detection of attacks                               | Yes                     | Yes                                                          |\n| Mitigation of most the common DDoS attacks (layers 3 and 4)  | Yes                     | Yes                                                          |\n| Attack volume (layers 3 and 4)                               | Up to 5 Gbps            | Up to 20 Gbps                                                |\n|                                                              |                         | Up to 50 Gbps                                                |\n|                                                              |                         | Unlimited                                                    |\n| Customization of rules for more sophisticated attacks (layers 3 and 4) | -             | Yes                                                          |\n| Cost protection to avoid excess traffic charges in case of volumetric attacks | -      | Yes                                                          |\n| Protection against layer 7 attacks, such as SQL Injection, XSS, RFI, Resource Exhaustion and others | Yes*                    | Yes*                  |\n| Customization of rules to mitigate attacks from the application layer (layer 7) | Self-service*           | Self-service or with SRT support *        |\n| Notification of network and transport layer attacks (layers 3 and 4) | -               | Yes                                                          |\n| Post-event analysis of network and transport layer attacks (layers 3 and 4) | -        | Yes, upon contracting Mission Critical Support               |\n| 24×7 access to the SRT                                       | -                       | Yes, upon contracting the Unlimited and Mission Critical Support attack volume |\n| Protection for your infrastructure (BGP)                     | -                       | Yes, upon contracting the Infrastructure Protection add-on   |\n| Protection for your DNS (Slave DNS/DNSSEC)                   | -                       | Yes, upon contracting the DNS Protection add-on              |\n| Contracting model                                            | Included                | Reserved Capacity (minimum of 12 months)                     |\n\n> \\* Requires Azion Edge Firewall and Web Application Firewall modules.\n",

    "body": "\nAzion **Edge Firewall** is a security product that protects from the network layer to the application layer. Your security team finds the most advanced features to protect your applications from all types of attacks in a single place.\n\nWith **Edge Firewall**, you can extend your security perimeter to the network edge, since your access control rules are processed directly through the Azion **Edge Network**, closer to users, preventing unwanted requests from reaching your origin or accessing your applications.\n\n> Because it is a programmable, modular and extendible firewall, it allows you to choose the modules that suit your needs.\n\nYou can make your own protection source code available and run it directly on the Azion distributed network. This benefits both the end-user and the application itself, as the user has access to a protected application with low latency. Protect against complex attacks by extending the protection perimeter to the edge.\n\n#### With the Edge Firewall you can:\n\n- Create allowed rules, blocklists, and greylists based on either the IP/CIDR address or the ASN or location of the user.\n- Protect your applications from the Tor network and other malicious traffic sources, such as botnets, malwares, proxies, etc.\n- Limit the access rate to an application using complex criteria and multiple buckets.\n- Mitigate Denial of Service attacks (DoS and DDoS).\n- Protect applications from OWASP Top 10 threats.\n- Implement bot mitigation techniques, including blocklists, fingerprints, tampering protection, brute force prevention, advanced rate limiting, human challenge, etc.\n- Add your own source code protection or content access controls, to be run from **Edge Firewall**.\n- Seamlessly integrate Azion curated functions or third-party software to be run in **Edge Firewall**, extending native platform functionalities with out-of-the-box solutions to IP reputation, fingerprint, JWT tokening, credential stuffing, account takeover, price scraping, contact scraping, etc.\n\n---\n\n## How it works\n\nBy using Azion as your edge computing platform, you can create security settings on **Edge Firewall** to protect your applications.\n\n**Edge Firewall** settings, called _Rule Sets_, are sets of security rules that must be applied to a group of domains.\n\n> You can share the same _Rule Set_ among all applications that adopt the same security policy.\n\n_Rule Sets_ consists in the selection of domains where **Edge Firewall** should be applied, what are the applied modules (see list below), and what are the security rules configured in _Rules Engine_.\n\n- DDoS Protection.\n- Edge Functions.\n- Network Layer Protection.\n- Web Application Firewall.\n\nYou need at least one activated module to use Azion **Edge Firewall**.\n\n> To ensure the security of your applications at all layers, we recommend that you _activate them all_.\n\nAfter activating the modules you want, you must configure your security rules in _Rules Engine_. The rules you configure will run sequentially until the request is blocked or restricted or until all your rules are processed, at which point the request is released. The request's data stream only passes into your edge application if none of your **Edge Firewall** rules block or reject the request, ensuring that malicious requests don't reach your application.\n\nEach rule is made of conditions - _Criteria_ -  and _Behaviors_. The _Behaviors_ setup will run if the conditions are met. For example, you can set up rules to block requests that come from IPs that are in a _blocklist_ or even make up rules to exclude IPs that are in the allowed rules list. In this example, “block” is the _Behavior_, while the IP of the request is in the _blacklist_ and not present in the _allowed rules_ is the condition - _Criteria_.\n\n> The _criteria_ and _behaviors_ available in the **Edge Firewall** depends on the modules you have enabled in the _Rule Set_.\n\n---\n\n## Edge Firewall Modules\n\nAzion **Edge Firewall** has the following modules that can help you build high-performance, scalable, safe edge applications, without heavy maintenance.\n\n### DDoS Protection\n\nThe **DDoS Protection** module protects your content and applications against attacks of the _Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)_ type, as it detects attacks using advanced algorithms that run on Azion's distributed network. This distributed network is connected to several mitigation centers to guarantee mitigation during large-scale attacks, both at the network and application levels.\n\nThrough a modern approach to detect and mitigate attacks to the network, transport, and application layers, we reduce downtime without impacting your service's performance.\n\n[See more](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/ddos-protection/)\n\n---\n\n### Edge Functions\n\n**Edge Functions** are components of Azion’s **Edge Computing Platform**, which enable serverless functions to be added to your applications, relieving your infrastructure, performing functions closer to the end-user, ensuring the necessary agility and scalability to meet your business objectives.\n\nYou can benefit from a microservice-based architecture by creating functions that run close to end-users.\n\nYou can also write your own security source code and deploy it to run at the edge of the network, close to the end-user or choose from ready-to-use solutions.\n\nYou can still use security solutions to protect sensitive data detection, identification and management of bots (botnets), covering the protection of websites, applications, APIs, and mobile applications against attacks at the edge of the network.\n\nYou can also use **Edge Functions** to configure an IP reputation service that covers website protection, applications, APIs and mobile apps, as well as web parameter tampering and cookie tampering.\n\n[See more](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/edge-functions-instances/).\n\n---\n\n### Network Layer Protection\n\nThis module allows the creation of filters by IP / CIDR, ASN addresses or by countries (geolocation), through the configuration of network lists and the definition of business rules that will validate blocking or release _criteria_, according to your need, specified on your **Edge Firewall's** _Rules Engine_.\n\nOperating within layers 3 and 4 of the OSI model, the **Network Layer Protection** extends the **Edge Network** protection range, closer to your end-user.\n\n- [See more](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/network-layer-protection/)\n- [Edge Functions on Edge Firewall](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/edge-functions/firewall/)\n\n#### Origin Shield Add-on\n\nWith **Origin Shield** add-on, you can create a security perimeter for your origin infrastructure, be it a cloud provider, hosting, or even your own data center. You can configure that only some specific IP addresses on our network can access your origin, and all requests from unwanted IP addresses are blocked.\n\n---\n\n### Web Application Firewall\n\nAzion **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** protects your applications against threats such as SQL Injections, Remote File Inclusion (RFI), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and many others. The WAF analyses HTTP and HTTPS requests, detects and blocks threats before they can reach your infrastructure and affect your application performance.\n\nIt works at layer 7 at the application level and is based on _scoring_, that is, each request is compared with a very rigorous and detailed set of application patterns and is given a _score_, which is associated with a certain threat family. According to the _score_ that this request has, it can be released or blocked. This happens directly in Azion's **Edge Nodes** before the threat reaches your origin or causes any damage. It is possible to customize the desired sensitivity, and have a differentiated blocking for each threat family.\n\n[See more](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/web-application-firewall/).\n",

    "body": "\nAzion's **Network Layer Protection** allows you to create lists based on the network IP/CIDR, user location or Autonomous System (ASN), or use automatic lists maintained and updated by Azion, such as a Tor network address list. With this, you can block, monitor suspicious behavior or apply restrictions, such as access limit.\n\n> It is a programmable security perimeter where you get your network layer protection at the edge from all inbound and outbound traffic.\n\nIf you have a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) or other security tools in your infrastructure, you can use the *Network Lists API* to keep your *blocklists* and *allowlists* always up to date.\n\n***\n\n## How it works\n\nWhen activating the **Network Layer Protection** module in *Main Settings* of a Rule Set in **Edge Firewall**, the *Conditions (criteria) and behaviors* will be enabled in the *Rules Engine* tab of the Rule Set.\n\nThe *conditions (criteria)* available with the activation of the **Network Layer Protection** module are:\n\n* Hostname.\n* Network.\n* Request URI.\n* Scheme. \n\nAnd the *behaviors* are:\n\n* Deny (403 forbidden).\n* Drop (close without response).\n* Set Rate Limit.\n\nUse the *Network Criteria* to create rules with lists based on the network, user location, or ASN, or use ready-to-use lists that are kept up-to-date by Azion itself, such as the outbound addresses of the Tor Network *Azion IP Tor Exit Nodes*. You can block, monitor suspicious behavior, or apply restrictions according to the chosen behavior.\n\nActivate other modules in the *Rule Set* to get numerous combinations of conditions and behavior in the *Rules Engine*. For example, *Network Layer Protection* and **Web Application Firewall** If: Network matches *My-Country-BlockList* and *Header User Agent* - Unique criteria of the **Web Application Firewall** module - *does not match* Googlebot Then: **Deny**. In this case requests originating from countries that are on the blocklist will be blocked unless the user-agent header contains \"Googlebot\".\n\n> The conditions and behaviors available in **Edge Firewall** depend on the modules you enable in the *Rule Set*. You will have a greater number of protection combinations if the **Web Application Firewall module** is also enabled.\n\n***\n\n## Network Lists\n\nThrough **Network Lists**, you can create, search, or update the Network Lists used in the _Edge Firewall Rules Engine_. Add and maintain your own lists in **Network Lists** via  Real-Time Manager or API. A single Network List can be associated with more than one Edge Firewall Rule or Rule Set. Whenever the Network List is updated, it will automatically propagate to all the rules in the associated Network List. To find out more and learn how to use it, check the [Network Lists](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/network-layer-protection/network-lists/) support documentation.\n\n***\n\n## Origin Shield \n\n**Origin Shield** is an Azion **Network Layer Protection** add-on. You will be able to create a security perimeter for your origin infrastructure, be it a *cloud*, *hosting* provider, or even your own *data center*. With this service, your origin will be able to restrict access only to specific IP addresses of our network and block any other access to your origin.\n\nOur IP list may change frequently, but after updating it, we will only put the new servers into production for those using the **Origin Shield** add-on 7 days after the list is published. You can also track and trace the changes made to the list through the *History* of the **Real-Time Manager**. There, you can find which IP's have been added or deleted from the list.\n\nOur *quarantine* process allows you to add new addresses one week in advance, which means that whenever a new address is added to the list, it will be on standby for seven days before being activated, giving you that time to update your firewall rules.\n\n> All users of the **RTM** accounts with the product enabled are notified by their **RTM** user emails whenever the **Origin Shield** addresses change.\n\n**Origin Shield** is available via **Real-Time Manager** or our API. To learn more and how to use our API, check the documentation on how to [Consult Network List data - Origin Shield.](/en/documentation/products/api/v3/network-lists/)\n",

If you prefer, also enter the subnet mask of the IP addresses.           |\n| ASN       | AS Number refers to *Autonomous System Number Allocation* which corresponds to a group of IP address networks managed by one or more network operators that have a clear and unique routing policy. Consulting the ASN Whois service for [LACNIC](http://lacnic.net/cgi-bin/lacnic/whois?lg=EN), Azion's ASN, for example, is AS52580. Choose the ASN type to represent a list of AS groups, filling in one address per line, with only the number without the prefix. |\n| Countries | It corresponds to a list of Countries. To include Countries in the list, select the items in the *Available Countries* tab and move to the *Chosen Countries* tab. |\n\nAfter creating a **Network List**, associate it with one or more *Rules* or **Rule Sets** that have the **Network Layer Protection** module activated.\n\n> A **Network List** is effective when it's associated with one or more Rules in the **Edge Firewall Rules Engine** via the conditional *(Criteria)*. To do this, the **Network Layer Protection** module must be enabled.\n\nTo provide even more agility to your processes, Azion provides and maintains **Network Lists** that are updated automatically and ready to use. One of them is the *Azion IP Tor Exit Nodes* *Network List*, which contains the IP addresses of the *Tor* network that can be used in one or more Rules through the condition *(Criteria)* Network according to your business needs.\n\n> The content of the Network Lists provided by Azion can't be modified.\n",

    "body": "\nThe **Rules Engine** is designed for you to be able to implement your security logic at the edge. Based on programmable criteria, you choose what you want to do.\n\nHere are some of the ways **Rules Engine** can help you: \n\n* Block a request.\n* Ignore a request.\n* Limit the access rate.\n* Apply Web Application Firewall (WAF) policy.\n* Run an **Edge Function** with your own security code.\n* Monitor traffic to identify threats.\n\n---\n\n## How it works\n\nEach request from your users to your application is processed first by **Edge Firewall**.\n\nYou can define a set of security rules in **Edge Firewall**. The rules are composed by *Criteria*, which represent the conditions for executing the rules, and by *Behaviors*, which represent the actions that need to be executed.\n\nThe processing of the rules is sequential and you can use them as *Criteria* as a powerful set of variables and comparison operators. If the conditions are met, the *Behaviors* of each rule are executed until all the rules are processed or a rule with a finalizing behavior is found in the path - *Deny* or *Drop*.\n\n---\n\n## Rules\n\nRules are always composed of *Criteria* (conditions) and *Behaviors* (actions). You can also add a *description* to your rule sets.\n\n### Description\n\nAside from the name of the rule, you can add a description to your rule using the **Description** field. Your description will be visible from the rule set list and can be used to help you identify what the rule does.\n\n### Criteria\n\nIt determines the set of conditions that need to be met for the execution of *Behaviors*.\n\n#### Variables\n\n| Criteria               | Description                                                  | Requirements             |\n| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |\n| Header Accept          | Header that tells you what types of media the customer accepts for the response. | Web Application Firewall |\n| Header Accept-Encoding | Header that tells you what types of content encoding, usually compression algorithms that the client accepts for the response. | Web Application Firewall |\n| Header Accept-Language | Header that informs the expected language.                   | Web Application Firewall |\n| Header Cookie          | Header containing the cookies sent by the client in the request to the server. | Web Application Firewall |\n| Header Origin          | Header that informs the origin of a cross-site access request or a preflight request. The source is a URI indicating the name of the server, with no path information. | Web Application Firewall |\n| Header Referer         | Header indicating the address of the document, or element in a document, from which the request's URI was obtained. | Web Application Firewall |\n| Header User Agent      | Header with a characteristic string that allows servers to identify the application, operating system, vendor and/or version of the device. | Web Application Firewall |\n| Hostname               | In order of precedence: the *hostname* of the request line, or the value of the *Host* header field of the request, or the name of the server serving the request. | -                        |\n| Network                | The IP address of the client making the HTTP request, which can be used for any network comparison (CIDR, ASN or Country). | Network Layer Protection |\n| Request Args           | All arguments sent by the user in the request string (*query string*). | Web Application Firewall |\n| Request Method         | The request's HTTP method. For example: GET, POST, PUT, etc. | -                        |\n| Request URI            | This relates to the `${uri}` variable from Rules Engine for Edge Applications. The normalized (urldecoded) URI of the request. The value of `${uri}` can change during the processing of a request, for example, when an internal redirect occurs or when index files are used. It does NOT carry the Query String parameters as `${request_uri}` do.| -                        |\n| Scheme                 | The scheme of the request: http or https.                    | -                        |\n| Client Certificate Validation | Server process to authenticate client digital certificate. | - |  \n\n\n#### Comparison Operators\n\nThe condition for the execution of a rule must be the comparison of a variable with an argument. The comparison operators are:\n\n| Operador            | Description                                                  | Argument                   |\n| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |\n| is equal            | The value of the variable is equal to the argument, compared character by character. | string                     |\n| is not equal        | The value of the variable is not exactly the same as the argument. | string                     |\n| starts with         | The value of the variable starts with the argument.          | string                     |\n| does not start with | The value of the variable does not start with the argument.  | string                     |\n| matches             | The value of the variable matches the regular expression or list entered as an argument. | regular expression<br />list |\n| does not match      | The value of the variable does not match the regular expression entered as an argument. | regular expression<br />list |\n| exists              | The variable has a defined value. For example, Request Args exists if an argument is sent in the request's query string. | -                          |\n| does not exist      | The variable does not have a defined value. For example, Request Args does not exist if an argument is sent in the request's query string. | -                          |\n\n> Note: The options vary according to the selected *Criteria*.\n\n#### Logic Operators\n\nMultiple conditions can be defined using the logical operators \"*and*\" and \"*or*”. The operator “and” has implicit precedence over the operator “*or*”.\n\nIf explicit precedence is required, you can add multiple criteria groups under the \"*and*\" logic.\n\n### Behaviors\n\nIn *Behavior*, you add the behaviors (actions) you want to perform if the rule's conditions (Criteria) are met.\n\n| Behavior                      | Description                                                  | Requirements             |\n| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |\n| Deny (403 Forbidden)          | It closes the request with HTTP *403 Forbidden* response.    | -                        |\n| Drop (Close Without Response) | It closes the request without responding to the customer.    | -                        |\n| Set Rate Limit                | It defines an access rate limit that, if exceeded, will result in an HTTP *429 Too Many Requests* response. To configure the *Rate Limit*, you must inform:<br />**Type** is the field to select the type of request for the Rate Limit, choosing **Req/s** (Requests per Second) or **Req/Min** (Requests per Minute); <br />**Average Rate Limit**, which is the limit rate itself by second; <br />**Client IP address**, if you want the access rate to be counted by the client's IP address or **Global**, if you want total access rate counted; <br />**Maximum burst size***, which indicates the maximum burst size of HTTP requests sent simultaneously, which will be queued and dispatched gradually, respecting the limit rate. <br /><br />`* The Maixumum Burst size is only available for the \"Req/s\"(Request per Second).`<br />The configured value will be the Rate Limit for each Azion Edge Node, implemented using the Leaky Bucket algorithm. We recommend that you use *Maximum burst size* at a maximum of 10 times of the value configured in *Average Rate Limit*, which would result in penalizing the last request for a burst with up to a 10 second delay. | -                        |\n| Set WAF Rule Set              | It associates the WAF Rule Set to be used in the request. WAF policies must be previously configured in the *Edge Libraries > WAF Rules*. | Web Application Firewall |\n| Run Function                  | It runs a function specified as a parameter. The function must have been previously instantiated and parameterized in the Functions tab, in order to be used. | Edge Functions           |",

WAF analyzes HTTP and HTTPS requests, detects and blocks malicious acts before they reach your infrastructure, without impacting the performance of your applications.\n\n---\n\n## Creating a WAF Rule Set for your applications\n\n**WAF Rule Set** is the set of rules that protects against the most varied types of attacks. It defines the protections you want to activate, the detection sensitivity level and the *whitelist*.\n\n#### To create a *WAF Rule Set*:\n\n1.  Access [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/) and go to the **Edge Libraries** > **WAF Rules** menu;\n2.  Click the **Add WAF** button to add a new **Rule Set**;\n3.  Give your **WAF** a suggestive name. You will need it to later join the **Rule Set** through **Rules Engine**;\n4.  Select the **Mode** you want: **Counting** or **Blocking**;\n5.  Activate the protections and select one of the five desired sensitivity levels in the **Main Settings** > **Threat Type Configuration** tab;\n6.  Clich the **Save** button.\n\n**Counting Mode** is used to specify that **WAF** should not block any request. It will analyze your traffic and will count threats. **Blocking Mode** is used to analyze and block detected threats, protecting your application from malicious users.\n\n> We recommend that you activate the rule in **Counting Mode** at the first moment, to follow the sample of threats detected in the learning stage, before effectively blocking requests. That way you can also adjust the detection sensitivity, according to your application.\n\nDuring **Counting Mode**, it is recommended that you leave all protections enabled so that you can monitor the threats detected by WAF.\n\nIf false positives are detected, some rules can be added to the *whitelist* by Azion Support, without the need to disable the full protection for a family of threats. Contact us if you wish to assess the need to include *whitelist* rules before disabling your protection.\n\nFinally, the **Rule Set** must be active for WAF to analyze your requests. The **Active** checkbox allows you to enable and disable WAF quickly for all *paths* that are associated with the **Rule Set**.\n\n---\n\n## Monitoring threat detection\n\nLeave the **WAF Rule Set** in **Counting Mode** for as long as you deem necessary so that most of your application's functionality is covered. \n\n> You should follow the graphics on the **WAF** tab through **Real-Time Metrics** > **Edge Applications** or the **WAF logs** through **Real-Time Events** and **Data Streaming** products. \n\nIn **Real-Time Metrics**, the first graph on the *WAF* tab *(Threats vs Requests)* shows three time series:\n\n*   **Regular Requests:** all HTTP and HTTPS requests are analyzed by WAF and are considered secure.\n*   **Threats:** the volume of threats detected by WAF and accounted for, when in **Counting** mode. These threats are not being blocked at the moment.\n*   **Threats Blocked:** threats effectively blocked by WAF. To start blocking the threats found, the rule set must be in **Blocking Mode**.\n\nIf you also have the **Data Streaming** service, you can track more detailed information about IP, date and time of access, status code, detected attack family and the configured mode of action.\n\n~~~\n$time-iso8601 $azion-client-id $azion-virtualhost-id $azion-configuration-id $azion-solution $azion-solution-id $host $conn-request-time $req-method $resp-status $req-uri $waf-threat-family $waf-threat-action $client-geoip-country-name $client-geoip-region-name $client-addr $client-port $req-header(User-Agent) $req-header(Referer) 2017-01-04T17:00:19+00:00 1234a 10203b 1020304050 ha 1441740010 www.yoursite.com 0.129 GET 200 /request-uri?key=value $XSS $LEARNING-BLOCK Brazil Sao Paulo 1.2.3.4 61511 Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/55.0.2883.87 Safari/537.36 https://www.yoursite.com/referrer 2017-01-04T17:00:19+00:00 1234a 10203b 1020304050 ha 1441740010 www.yoursite.com 0.025 POST 200 /request-uri $SQL $LEARNING-BLOCK Brazil Santa Catarina 2.3.4.5 61513 Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/55.0.2883.87 Safari/537.36 https://www.yoursite.com/referrer 2017-01-04T17:00:40+00:00 1234a 10203b 1020304050 ha 1441740010 www.yoursite.com 0.026 GET 301 /request-uri?key=value $RFI $LEARNING-BLOCK Brazil Rio de Janeiro 5.6.7.8 26102 Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 5.1.1; SM-G800H Build/LMY47X) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/55.0.2883.91 Mobile Safari/537.36 https://www.yoursite.com/referrer 2017-01-04T17:00:41+00:00 1234a 10203b 1020304050 ha 1441740010 www.yoursite.com 0.391 POST 200 /request-uri $UWA $LEARNING-BLOCK Brazil Rio Grande do Sul 9.10.11.12 26102 Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 5.1.1; SM-G800H Build/LMY47X) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/55.0.2883.91 Mobile Safari/537.36 https://www.yoursite.com/referrer\n~~~\n\nBased on this information, you can adjust the sensitivity of the *WAF Rule Set*, until no more false positives occur.

    "body": "\n**Web Application Firewall (WAF)** protects your applications from threats such as *SQL Injections*, *Remote File Inclusion (RFI)*, *Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)*, and other web vulnerabilities. WAF analyzes HTTP and HTTPS requests, detects, and blocks malicious activity before it reaches your application infrastructure.\n\nWAF operates in the seventh layer of the OSI model, the application layer, where the relationship between web applications and their respective network services and user data takes place. It also works as a barrier to filter and monitor traffic between your application and the requests from the internet.\n\n\n## How WAF works\n\n**Web Application Firewall** is an Azion **Edge Firewall** module based on the requisition *scoring* methodology. Each HTTP/HTTPS request is compared to a very strict and detailed set of application standards and given a *score* that is associated with a particular family of threats.\n\nAccording to the *score* received by the request, it can be released or blocked directly in Azion's edge nodes, before the threat reaches its origin or causes any type of damage. You define the desired level of sensitivity for blocking each family of threats.\n\nTo avoid blocking lawful requests and malfunctions of your application, you must perform a learning step. In this step, the **WAF Rule Set** identifies the legitimate behaviors of your application by placing them on an *allowlist*.\n\nIf internal traffic, tests, and false positives are being blocked by WAF, you can also fine-tune its settings in the **Tuning** tab, inside a created WAF.\n\n> To use WAF Rule Sets, you must enable the Web Application Firewall module in the Edge Firewall Rule Set.\n\n---\n\n## Creating a WAF\n\nTo access the WAF page:\n\n1. Access [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).\n2. Open the **Products menu**, indicated by the icon ☰.\n3. In the **Edge Libraries** category, click **WAF Rules**. This page will show all WAFs created. If you don't have any WAF configured, click the **Add WAF** button.\n\nThe button will send you to the WAF configuration page, with the field to add an **Identifier name**, the tabs **Main Settings**, **Tuning**, and **Allowed Rules**, in addition to the **Threat Type Configuration** table, where you set the sensitivity level for each threat family.\n\n---\n\n## Main Settings\n\nThe **Threat Type Configuration** table is available in the **Main Settings** tab. Threats are categorized into families, according to the purpose of the attack.\n\n| Threat family | Description |\n|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| SQL Injections Sensitivity | Detects attack attempts by injecting SQL code into the application. |\n| Remote File Inclusions (RFI) | Detects attempts to include files, usually through scripts on the web server. |\n| Directory Traversal | Prevents exploitation of vulnerability regarding insufficient sanitization of file name fields provided by users, so that characters representing shortcuts to the parent directory are passed through the file API. |\n| Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) | Prevents the injection of client-side scripts into pages viewed by your visitors. |\n| File Upload | Detects the attempt to upload files to the web server. |\n| Evading Tricks | Protects against some coding tricks used to try to evade protective mechanisms. |\n| Unwanted Access | Detects attempts to access administrative or vulnerable pages, bots, and security scanning tools. |\n| Identified Attacks | Prevents several types of common attacks and known vulnerabilities that should certainly be blocked. |\n\nYou can also enable or disable protection for each threat family individually through the **Active** switch in the third column.\n\n### Sensitivity levels and WAF scores\n\nSensitivity levels defines how strictly WAF will consider a request as a threat. A request will be blocked by WAF if it obtains a score greater than or equal to the configured sensitivity level threshold.\n\n| Sensitivity   | Description and WAF sore threshold                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Lowest        | The requisition will be considered a threat if it presents very strong evidence and receives a *score* greater than or equal to 40. This sensitivity has a lower level of protection for your applications, but it'll also avoid blocking requests with less chance of false positives.                  |\n| Low           | The request will be considered a threat if it presents very strong evidence and receives a *score* greater than or equal to 24. This sensitivity has a lower level of protection for your applications, but it'll also avoid blocking requests with less chance of false positives.                      |\n| Medium        | Recommended sensitivity level. The request will be considered a threat if it presents sufficient evidence and receives a *score* greater than or equal to 16.                                                                                                                                            |\n| High          | At the slightest hint of a threat, the requisition may be blocked, even when it has a *score* greater than or equal to 8. This level of sensitivity may present more false positives if the learning stage doesn't have sufficient coverage on the variability of scenarios and uses of its application. |\n| Highest       | At the slightest hint of a threat, the requisition may be blocked, even when it has a *score* greater than or equal to 4. This level of sensitivity may present more false positives if the learning stage doesn't have sufficient coverage on the variability of scenarios and uses of its application. |\n\nEach sensitivity level tolerates a defined number of threat indicatives, the WAF score represents this amount of threat indicatives. The more flexible the sensitivity level is, the higher the WAF score it accepts. The most rigid sensitivity levels, on the other hand, only accept requests with a less signs of threats.\n\n---\n\n## WAF Tuning\n\n**WAF Tuning** is an analytical tool that shows IPs blocked by possible attack attempts. The Tuning tab is where you can make the WAF's operation more flexible. Blocked IPs are displayed grouped in the **Filter Possible Attacks** table. You can filter by Domain, Time Range, Network Lists, IP, and Countries.\n\nIn the filters below **Filter Possible Attacks**:\n\n1. Enter the domain (required), time range, which Network Lists you prefer to use, which IPs you are investigating, and the country of origin of the requests.\n2. Click the **Apply filter** button.\n\n> To see IPs blocked by WAF, you must at least specify the domain (or the domains) of your application. The other fields are optional but enable a more detailed selection.\n\nBy clicking the **Apply filter** button, a list of **Possible Attacks** will be displayed. This list includes the fields **Rule ID**, **Description**, **Hits**, **IPs**, **Countries**, **Top 10 IPs Address**, and **Top 10 Countries**.\n\nFor more information about these possible attacks, see the WAF [Custom Allowed Rules](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/web-application-firewall/custom-allowed-rules/) documentation.\n\nIf you notice internal traffic, tests, or even false positives being blocked by WAF, you can create an **Allowed Rule** for these IPs and blocked behaviors. To do this:\n\n1. Click on the line that represents the blocked rule, to read more details such as *Field* and *Top 10 Paths*.\n2. Select the *checkbox* of the rules you want to allow.\n3. Click **Allow Rules**. A modal will appear asking to confirm the action and describe the reason.\n\n> **Tip**: it's important to remember that when describing the reason, it'll overwrite the description of the Rule ID. If you want to keep the description, along with the reason, copy the description and paste along with the reason.\n\n---\n\n## Allowed Rules\n\nThe Allowed Rules are composed of the fields:\n\n- **Rule ID**: unique numeric ID of each WAF rule.\n- **Rule Descriptions**: textual description of what the rule does.\n- **URI**: Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is the path that goes after the domain in the URL. Example: `/products/edge-firewall`.\n- Path: when specified, restricts the application of the Match Zone only to the defined path. The path delimits the scope of action of the rule.\n- **Match Zone**: parts or fields of the requisition that'll be compared with the `match pattern`. It could be:\n   - Path: the `match pattern` will be compared with the request *path*.\n   - Query String: the `match pattern` will be compared to the *query string*, also called *GET arguments*.\n   - Request Header: the `match pattern` will be compared to the HTTP headers of the request.\n   - Request Body: the `match pattern` will be compared to the body of a POST, also called *POST arguments*.\n   - File Name (Multipart Body): the `match pattern` will be compared with the name of files in *multipart POSTs*.\n   - Raw Body: The `match pattern` will be compared to the uninterpreted body of a requisition, also called the *unparsed body*.\n- **Last Editor**: name of the last user to modify this *Allowed Rule*.\n- **Last Modified**: date the rule was last modified.\n- **Active**: *Allowed Rule* status.\n\nIf you want to delete a created rule:\n\n1. Go to the *Allowed Rules* tab.\n2. Click on the trash can icon.\n3. Type *delete* in the confirmation window, then click the *Delete* button.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KWZaLXudFEg\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n",

To authorize an edge node, follow the steps below:\n\n1. Open the list of **Edge Nodes** in [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/).\n2. Click on the **icon** (key) and accept the confirmation window.\n\n> After the authorization, the **Edge Node** can take up to *10 seconds* before services can be orchestrated.\n\nYou can also authorize all the edge nodes you want at once. To start using  this option, follow the steps below:\n\n1. Open the list of Edge Nodes in [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/).\n2. Select the items you want to authorize or, if you prefer, select all items by checking the first check box on the left.\n3. On the top right corner, click the **Actions** button and select **Authorize**.\n4. A message to confirm your action will be shown, click the **Confirm** button to save your selection.\n5. You'll see the following confirmation message: \"*X nodes were successfully authorized!*\"\n\n---\n\n## Services\n\nYou can provision the services registered in your library by following steps:\n\n1. Open the list of **Edge Nodes** in [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/);\n2. Select the **Edge Node** that you want to configure;\n3. Open the **Services** tab and click the **Add Service** button;\n4. Link it to the service you want and, if necessary, you can configure the variables required by the service.\n\n> Services that are due to be orchestrated via Edge Node, must be registered in **Edge Libraries** > **Edge Services** and marked as active.\n\nOnce the service is provided, Edge Node can begin orchestrating it based on resource priorities. You can monitor the service installation process via logs in the Edge Orchestrator agent.\n\n> The service installation logs are stored in <br/>`/var/log/azion/edge-services.log`\n\n---\n\n## Agent commands and options \n\nThe Edge Orchestrator agent has additional commands and options to make it easier to use.\n\n|  | Description |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| --debug or -d | It sets the agent logs to debug mode. |\n| --help or -h | It helps on the commands that the agent can execute. |\n| install | It installs the agent to the client’s device, copies the binary to the installation location; adds the Edge Orchestrator agent to the device's service manager (if any) and; sets up credentials to authenticate the Edge Node. |\n| start \\[--foreground\\] | It initializes the Edge Orchestrator agent through the device's service manager.<br /> Note: The foreground option is used to run it in the foreground. |\n| start -g OR --join-group | By using these flags followed by a comma separated list of group names, you can enroll your edge-node with the specified group(s) through commandline while starting your node for the first time. <br/> Example: sudo edge-orchestrator start -g GROUP1,GROUP2,GROUP3 --foreground |\n| start \\[-n OR --set-name\\] | By using these flags followed by the desired name, you can specify your new node’s name through commandline while starting your node for the first time . By not using them, the hostname is used as default value. <br/> Example: sudo edge-orchestrator start -n Edgenodename --foreground |\n| status | It reports on the status of the execution of the Edge Orchestrator agent. |\n| stop | It stops the Edge Orchestrator agent through the device's service manager. |\n| uninstall | It uninstalls the agent from the client’s device, removes the binary from the installation location; removes the Edge Orchestrator agent from the device's service manager (if any).<br />Note: authentication credentials remain on the device and can be removed using the Azion control panel. |\n| --version or -v | It displays the installed version of the agent. |\n\n---\n\n## Watcher\n\nTo avoid any configuration changes to the resources managed by Orchestrator, the agent provides a feature called **Watcher**.\n\nIt's a non-manageable feature of Azion agent that restores any tampered file. It consists of a group of *workers* that periodically scan all provisioned files looking for any drift—modification or removal—based on the last applied manifest, restoring the desired state, if necessary.\n\nYou can verify any action made by Watcher by looking at the *logfile* `/var/log/azion/edge-orchestrator.log`.\n\n```\n    # /var/log/azion/edge-orchestrator.log\n    {\"level\":\"info\",\"time\":\"2021-09-22T17:31:16Z\",\"message\":\"finished applying resources for version 3128\"}\n    {\"level\":\"info\",\"time\":\"2021-09-22T17:31:16Z\",\"message\":\"apply manifest 3128 finished\"}\n    {\"level\":\"info\",\"time\":\"2021-09-22T17:31:16Z\",\"message\":\"watcher: started with period of 60 seconds using 5 workers\"}\n    {\"level\":\"info\",\"time\":\"2021-09-22T17:32:16Z\",\"message\":\"watcher: dispatching workers\"}\n    {\"level\":\"info\",\"time\":\"2021-09-22T17:32:16Z\",\"message\":\"watcher: dispatched 5 workers\"}\n    {\"level\":\"info\",\"time\":\"2021-09-22T17:32:16Z\",\"message\":\"watcher: workers finished\"}\n    {\"level\":\"info\",\"time\":\"2021-09-22T17:32:16Z\",\"message\":\"watcher: checked 19576 artifacts, 0 drifted from manifest.\"}\n```\n",

You can manage and control resources on the edge in real time, as well as orchestrate your services quickly and easily to meet your needs.\n\n## With Edge Orchestrator you can\n\n- Manage and control edge resources in real time, including: provisioning, updating, and managing Edge Applications, Edge Firewalls, Edge Functions, Digital Certificates, Edge Nodes, Edge Services, and third party services via Marketplace.\n\n- Operate and run on different types of architecture: microprocessors, like x86 and ARM and different sizes of equipment, including Raspberry PI, network equipment such as switches and SD-WAN routers as well as corporate servers, because it was designed for it.\n\n- Use it with most network architecture, including local and public networks, and also behind NATs.\n\n- Simplify software installation and upgrading, since it's compiled with all core and library dependencies.\n\n---\n\n## How it works\n\nAn Azion Edge Orchestrator agent is installed on the edge nodes and provides end-to-end encrypted remote node management from the control panel [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/) – Azion Control Panel – based in the cloud and API. It can be deployed in two different ways: \n\n1. Through manual installation on each edge node. \n2. Automatic installation along with the operating system: a Linux distro or the image of a client's OS or hardware supplier, for example, an SD-WAN router, a network switch or a Linux server. Customers can use an automatic registration mode, which makes it simpler to deploy (for example: new node locations or using automatic node scaling), update and manage a large number of scaling edge nodes.\n\nAll services linked to edge nodes will be orchestrated and configured from the moment the device is authorized via the control panel. The orchestration is done sequentially and respects the dependencies between resources and triggers needed for its configuration.\n\n---\n\n## Edge Orchestrator modules\n\nAzion Edge Orchestrator has the following modules so that you can build a high performance, scalable and secure Edge network, more simply and free of operational tasks.\n\n### Edge Node\n\nThe **Edge Node** module enables devices to be created and managed, as well as integration with Azion. You need to install our agent so that Azion platform can orchestrate its settings and ensure secure communication between the devices and Azion.\n\n [Learn more about Edge Node](/en/documentation/products/edge-orchestrator/edge-node/).\n\n---\n\n### Edge Services\n\nThe Edge Services module enables the customer to create their own services. You can use your customized services with Edge and ensure your device is managed and orchestrated by Real-Time Manager.\n\n[Learn more about Edge Services](/en/documentation/products/edge-orchestrator/edge-services/)\n",

    "body": "\n**Azion Edge Services** is an **Edge Orchestrator** product module that allows orchestrated services to be managed in your own nodes, enabling the resources registration and other configurations via [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/) and the services creation and customization so that they can be orchestrated on the defined Edge Nodes.\n\nYou can configure the  install, uninstall, and reload triggers and define the dependencies between the resources needed to run your service on your Edge network.\n\n---\n\n## How it works\n\nBy using Azion as your edge platform, you can create and customize services to run on private and hybrid edge networks. Azion **Edge Services** operates using triggers to install, uninstall, and reload. It defines dependencies between resources and natively implements a set of Azion functions, such as Edge Applications, Edge Firewalls, and Edge Functions, using **Azion Cells** technology from Azion as its basis.\n\nThis way, you can build Edge Applications for a wide variety of uses, ranging from a high scale and quality CDN to hosting web applications, AI applications, VR, and many others. To do so, you have to *activate* Azion Cells and define the **Edge Nodes** that should host certain applications, all controlled by the Azion dashboard or APIs, in a centralized interface and with different access controls.\n\n### Resources\n\nIn order to be able to orchestrate services on your device, you need to configure all the **resources** needed to install, uninstall, and reload your services.\n\nA **Text** type resource indicates that the content will be copied as plain text to the device. These resource types are typically used for configuration files.\n\nA **Shell Script** type resource indicates that the resource will be installed and run according to the selected **trigger**. The Edge Orchestrator agent uses the sh-bang entered in the content header for script execution; in the absence of one, the POSIX-compliant **shell** on the device (*/bin/sh*) is used.\n\nBoth resource types are compatible with the use of **variables** and **facts**, as long as the tag`{{ VARNAME }}` or`{{ FACT_NAME }}` is included.\n\nAll resources are executed using the *Path* referred during the registration. The *Path* field refers to the absolute path of the directory. Relative paths won't be accepted and aren't supported.\n\n**Note**: there is a known issue when using the `{#` syntax. If you use `{# `and do not use `#}` as a closure, the resource will not be processed and will not be provisioned in the edges. If you use `{#` and then use `#}`, the content inside the block is considered a comment. In this case, the file is processed and provisioned but without the content inside the comment. To provision a resource with `{# my content #}` you must use the following pattern:`{{'{# my content #}'}}`. Our engineering team is aware of this issue and is working to fix it.\n\n### Variables\n\nVariables are dynamic values that affect the Edge Services that will be orchestrated and run on Edge Nodes. In other words, it is possible to orchestrate and run the same service, on different devices, with different values for the settings, such as configuring a service on port 3306 on one device, and on port 3307 on another device.\n\nVariables can be used in the resource content if the tag`{{VARNAME }}` is used. For example: <br />`port = {{ PORT_HTTP }}`\n\nThere are some special predefined variables that, as facts, cannot be overwritten. See the list in the table below:\n\n| Variable | Description | Value | Note |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CHANGESET_RM_PATH | It contains a path to a file that provides a list of paths to all files that have been removed or modified in the current manifest. | STRING | It is only available while the manifest is being applied. Each line has a unique path. |\n| CHANGESET_ADD_PATH | It contains a path to a file that provides a list of paths to all files that have been added or modified in the current manifest. | STRING | It is only available while the manifest is being applied. Each line has a unique path. |\n\n### Facts\n\nIn addition to the defined variables, you can also use **Facts** which are available technical information about your node, such as architecture, client version, operating system and operating system version. You can use these, for example, if you are setting up multiple nodes.\n\nThese values cannot be overwritten and can be used in **resources** using the `{{ FACT_NAME }}` tag. For example:<br /> `{{CLIENT_VERSION}}`.\n\n| Facts | Description | Value | Notes |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| CLIENT_VERSION | Edge Orchestrator agent version | MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH | For example: 1.10.3, where 1 is MAJOR, 10 is MINOR and 3 is PATCH |\n| ARCH | Processor architecture | ARM or; AMD (x86), both with 32 or 64 bits |  |\n| OS_NAME | Operating System distribution name | macOS; Linux; FreeBSD; OpenBSD; DragonFlyBSD; NetBSD; or Solaris |  |\n| OS_DISTRO | Operating System distribution name, only for systems based on Linux | NAME + RELEASE | NAME: Debian; Ubuntu; openSUSE; Mint Linux; Gentoo; Fedora; CentOS; Arch Linux or; Kali Linux <br /> <br /> RELEASE: first obtaining via LSB Release, if there is no search in /etc/os-release the value of VERSION_ID or DISTRIB_RELEASE <br /> <br /> In the case of other Operating Systems the value will always be empty. |\n| OS_VERSION | Version of the operating system, only for MacOS | MAJOR.MINOR | Example: 10.5. For other Operating Systems it will always be empty. |\n| CPUS | Number of CPUs available | INTEGER | Example: 1, 2, 4. |\n| RAM_SIZE | Total system memory | BYTES | Example: 1048576 |\n\n### Triggers\n\nWhen configuring **Shell Script** type resources, you need to define which triggers will cause the resource to run.\n\nThe triggers are \"Install\", \"Reload\" and \"Uninstall” and each has a function and order of execution:\n\n**1) Install:** this is the first to be run and must include the script needed to install the service.\n\n**2) Reload:** when configured, this will be run at the end of the installation of all the resources and also whenever there is any change to the links between the Edge Service and Edge Node, such as a change to the values of the variables.\n\n**3) Uninstall:** this is run every time the link between the Edge Services and Edge Node is broken. That means, whenever the service is deleted from the Edge Nodes for which it was provisioned.\n\n### Link to the Edge Node\n\nAll registered services can be orchestrated and run on one or more Edge Nodes on your private network.\n\nOnly active services will be available for orchestration on the Edge Node and, after it has been linked, you can change the value of existing variables or delete or add new services to the device.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Creating an Edge Service Step by Step\n\n1- Go to [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/);\n\n2- On the top left menu, select  **Edge Libraries** > **Edge Services**;\n\n3- Click on the **Add Service** button;\n\n**Note:** your service will be created automatically. You can change the name of the service by clicking on **My New Service** in the name bar.\n\n4-  Go to the **Resources** tab and click on **Add Resource** ;\n\n5- Configure the resources you need for your service, using the triggers: \"*Install*\", \"*Reload*\", and \"*Uninstall*\";\n\n6- Optional: where you have used variables in the content of one or more resources, you can set the default values for them in the **Environment** tab.\n\n**Note:** The variables must be in the format \"Variable = Value\", where \"Variable\" has been used in the content of resources that are already registered.\n\n7- Activate the service and click on the **Save** button;\n\nDone! Now your service can use one or more edge nodes.\n",

    "body": "\n**Edge Pulse** is an [Observe](/en/documentation/products/observe/) product based on the market-leading *Real User Monitoring (RUM)* solution. With it, you can:\n\n- Collect navigation, availability, latency, and bandwidth information.\n- Use the collected information to enhance the end user's experience.\n- Ensure efficient content delivery.\n\nEdge Pulse collects user browsing data and metrics on availability, latency, and throughput. After inserting the **Edge Pulse JavaScript tag**, the script:\n\n- Respects the protocol in use (HTTP/HTTPS).\n- Is fully asynchronous.\n- Doesn't interfere with the loading process or the internal structure of the delivered content.\n\nIn addition, each test collects metrics for only three addresses of Azion's edge network at a time, in a 30 minute interval per user. This way, it doesn't burden clients with test repetitions.\n\nThe tests occur in a continuous and diversified way and cover all possible routes which that user has to get the content. After the data collection, the results are sent to Azion’s processing servers.\n\nSee the [Edge Pulse first steps](/en/documentation/products/edge-pulse/first-steps/).\n\n---\n\n## What RUM is\n\nReal User Monitoring (RUM) is a monitoring model that captures end-user data to explain how your end users are being impacted by the availability and efficiency of your content delivery.\n\nIt's a passive way to monitor the end-user device in action. It provides insight into many issues, including front-end browser, back-end database, server-related issues, and how end users experience them.\n\n---\n\n## Edge Pulse behavior\n\n**Edge Pulse** uses the [UUID4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) algorithm to control with more efficiency cases of successes and failures.\n\nIt also uses the [local storage of the browser](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/API/Window/Window.localStorage)) to control and handle its data.\n\nEdge Pulse's tracking respects the following settings of the user's browser:\n\n| Value | Behavior of Edge Pulse |\n|-------|------------------------|\n| navigator.doNotTrack = '1' | If the tracking has never been allowed and, as a result, Edge Pulse has never used the local storage, then an identifier code will be generated for each visit that the user makes on the site.<br />If it's configured as \"1\", but it has been tracked before, the previous identifier is deleted and a new one is generated. |\n| navigator.doNotTrack `<>` '1' | When a value isn't \"1\", it means that Edge Pulse will track. Thus, the same identifier will be used for each visit of a user. |\n\n---\n\n## Edge Pulse JavaScript tag \n\nTo monitor the page, you need to insert the **Edge Pulse JavaScript tag** on it. It's available on the **Edge Pulse** page [on RTM](https://manager.azion.com/) through the **Copy to Clipboard** button.\n\nYou must add the **JavaScript tag** to start collecting metrics. This action is required for *each page* you want to monitor.\n\nThe execution starts after the user's browser has loaded the page. The tag can be published manually or using tag management systems available on the market.\n\nThere are two available tags:\n\n| Tag             | Description                                                   |\n| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Default Tag     | Place this tag in the HTML of the pages you want to collect data from. You must place it before the closing BODY tag. This script waits until the loading event is completed before downloading and running the RUM Client, ensuring that the loading event isn't interrupted and doesn't affect the user experience. |\n| Pre-loading Tag | If you're using Content Security Policy settings preventing the use of inline JavaScript, place this tag just before the enclosing BODY tag. This script executes before the load event is fired. |\n\n---\n\n## Collected data\n\n**Edge Pulse** collects information from the Resolver used for DNS resolution, edge location tested, and the user's anonymous network. You can use this data to make decisions regarding user routing.\n\nIn addition, you can explore user experience and navigation data via [Real-Time Events](/en/documentation/products/real-time-events/). See the [documentation page](/en/documentation/products/real-time-events/#DataSources) for a list of all available variables for Edge Pulse.\n",

    "body": "\nWhen typing a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) in the address bar of a web browser, you generally use a text pattern that is easy to read and remember, such as `www.azion.com`. Based on the provided URL, a request then occurs to a server located on the Internet, such as a postal address.\n\nIf the request is correct, the server responds with a web page or some other resource that was requested by the computer that made the request, called a client. This repetitive process is known as the *request and response cycle*.\n\nHowever, this pattern of writing addresses based on URLs, although easy for us to understand, is incomprehensible to computers in web communications, as they use an address based on numbers, known as **IP** address (Internet Protocol). Therefore, whenever you type a URL into the address bar, a conversion is required so that the URL is transformed into an IP address.\n\nThis works the same as when you make a traditional phone call to another person: phones can't understand names. They only recognize sequences of numbers that follow a specific protocol, with the country code, the region, and finally, the number associated with the recipient of the call. Therefore, catalogs are needed to relate the names of people, easily recognizable by the caller, to the respective telephone numbers to be used by the telephone system.\n\nIn the case of the Internet, it's necessary to convert a domain from a URL to a certain IP address so that communication is possible. This conversion takes place on special servers that work with the specific purpose of keeping the **Domain Name System** (DNS) in operation, which is a hierarchical system with the purpose of allowing the conversion of URL domains into IP addresses in a decentralized way, as can be seen in the diagram below.\n![Diagram 1 normal IP address conversion](/assets/docs/images/uploads/DNSSEC_documentation_diagram1.png)\n\nThis process is completely transparent to the user who accesses a page on the internet. It happens in several steps using different DNS servers and caching systems to speed up the responses.\n\nIn order to simplify the understanding, consider that a request to convert the domain of a URL originates from a computer connected to the internet. Then, it arrives at a server in the DNS system that is capable of fulfilling the requested task. However, at this point a question arises: how to ensure that this domain conversion from a URL to an IP address actually originated from a DNS system server?\n\nIt's possible for malicious intermediaries to modify the response IP address provided by the DNS system midway to the client that requested the conversion. This interference can lead the client's navigation to another destination than the one requested by the requested URL, opening the possibility of fraudulent actions, as shown in the diagram below.\n\n![Diagram 2 tampering with an IP address](/assets/docs/images/uploads/DNSSEC_documentation_diagram2.png)\n\nTo prevent this harmful interference, an extra layer of security can be added to the URL domain to IP address conversions in the DNS system, known as **Domain Name System Security Extensions** (DNSSEC).\n\nTo understand **DNSSEC** in a simple way, imagine that, in the physical world, you received a correspondence by traditional mail. How to ensure that the text contained in the letter was, in fact, created by the sender? You can include a signature in the document that is recognized by the recipient. This way, unsigned letters would be disregarded, and only those signed would be considered legitimate and with the content intact.\n\nThis is exactly how DNSSEC prevents fraudulent DNS responses from being used by client computers. Digital signatures sign the IP address responses coming from the DNS server, which are then verified by the recipient, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of the information, as shown in the diagram below.\n\n![Diagram 3 DNS response with DNSSEC security layer](/assets/docs/images/uploads/DNSSEC_documentation_diagram3.png)\n\n> **Note**: it's important to mention that DNSSEC doesn't encrypt data, it only guarantees the authenticity of the IP addresses returned after the URL domain conversion process. Information that travels over the internet is encrypted using the **HTTPS** protocol, when used. Its use has become a common practice in the exchange of information over the internet due to security issues.\n\n## Compatibility between DNSSEC and the Azion platform\n\nAzion's Edge platform is compatible with the **DNSSEC** specification, supporting its use on websites and applications accelerated by Azion.\n\nDNSSEC uses digital signatures to provide:\n- Cryptographic authentication of data.\n- Authenticated denial of existence.\n- Data integrity.\n\nBy verifying the signature associated with existing DNS records such as A, AAAA, CNAME, PTR etc., it's possible to validate that the requested DNS record originates from the authoritative DNS server and that its original content has been preserved, unchanged along the way.\n\nUnlike the cryptographic security provided by HTTPS over HTTP, the *confidentiality* of responses isn't guaranteed by DNSSEC. Data and keys travel in plain text, following the DNS protocol specifications, and are able to be cached, thus preserving the high performance of the service.\n\nFor an effective use of DNSSEC:\n1. Your **Top-Level Domain** (TLD) must support the use of DNSSEC.\n2. Your zone must be configured with DNSSEC-related resource records.\n3. DNSSEC must be enabled at your domain registrar; for example, your DNSSEC should be working.\n\n## Hosting a DNSSEC zone with Azion\n\nIf your contracted services specify that Azion is responsible for publishing the zone with **DNSSEC** (authoritative DNS), new records (RRs or *Resource Records*) will be added to the existing ones. In addition, the following information will be provided:\n- Public key (DS).\n- Algorithm used in key generation.\n- Address of DNS servers.\n\nThis way, you can proceed with DNSSEC activation at the competent domain registrar, for example `registro.br`, establishing a chain of trust.\n\nEach DNS zone has a public/private key pair. The zone's private key is used to sign DNS data in the zone and generates digital signatures on that data. The private key is kept secret and the public key is available in the DNS zone itself for anyone to retrieve.\n\nTo enable signature verification, DNSSEC requires the administration of new *Resource Records* (RR), in addition to those already in use:\n\n- **DNSKEY** contains the public key to be used in the verification.\n- **DS** (Delegation Signer) contains the HASH of a DNSKEY record. This record is used by recursive DNS servers to verify the authenticity of the DNSKEY itself.\n- **RRSIG** contains the digital signature of a record.\n- **NSEC and NSEC3** enable the non-existence response of a queried record, known as authenticated denial of existence, preventing a malicious actor from falsifying a non-existent address response.\n\n### General recommendations and considerations\n\n- Before contracting the service, make sure that the TLD registry supports **DNSSEC**.\n- A few days before the scheduled change, it's recommended to reduce the TTLs of the DNS zone to be transferred, as well as using the TTL of a few minutes in the DNSSEC records (DS and DNSKEY) in order to enable a quick recovery if necessary.\n- For the new settings to become effective, wait for a new publication by the person responsible for the TLD.\n- Effective propagation and global visibility of the change may take a few days, as it depends on updating the cache of resolvers administered by third parties.\n\n[Contact the Sales team](https://www.azion.com/en/contact-sales/) to host a DNS zone previously configured with DNSSEC at Azion.\n",

    "body": "\nAzion **Intelligent DNS** is a domain hosting service that is part of Azion's traffic routing solution. By using it, your domains will be hosted on Azion distributed infrastructure using the same performance and security solutions built for other Azion products, combining techniques to optimize requests with protection against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.\n\n***\n\n## What is a Domain Name System (DNS)\n\nAs the name implies, it is a domain name resolution system. It manages to translate your site's domain name into an Internet Protocol (IP) address so a connection can be established with the destination that will provide the requested website content.\n\nIt's the DNS that allows you to type in a domain name instead of a string of numbers. In other words, DNS translates the string of numbers (IP) of the domain you want to access into words that form the URL you know.\n\n***\n\n## How Intelligent DNS works\n\nIt's designed for those that want high performance and high availability for their hosting and their domain. **Intelligent DNS** is an authoritative DNS solution that allows the customers to manage their domains, zones, and records through a friendly and intuitive interface.\n\n> You can create ANAME type entries, which allow you to host and use *naked domains* with other Azion products.\n\n***\n\n## Configuring Intelligent DNS\n\n### Creating a Hosting Zone\n\n1. Go to [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/), access the **Products menu**, indicated by the `☰`  icon and select **SECURE** > **Intelligent DNS**. You will see the main interface where you can create and manage your zones.\n\n2. Click the *Add Zone* button and fill in the following fields:\n\n   * *Name for zone*: identifier for the newly created zone of the domain. This field is free text. You can enter text in whatever form suits you best.\n   * *Domain*: you can only enter the Domain Name in [FQDN](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/FQDN) format, in this field. Example: *mydomain.com*.  \n   * *Active*: this flag indicates whether the zone is active and therefore whether the Intelligent DNS should respond to it or not. Deactivated zones are ignored in DNS responses.\n\n3. Click the *Save* button to finish.\n\n### Creating or editing records linked to a hosting zone\n\nA record is used to find a computer IP address connected to the internet from a name.\n\n1. [Go to **RTM**](https://manager.azion.com/), select the **Products Menu** > **Intelligent DNS**.\n2. Click in the zone you want to edit.\n\n   You will see the main interface where you can create or edit your zones. When you do this, you will see two tabs:\n\n   * *Main Settings*: in this tab, you can edit the zone's name, the main domain, the DNS service status and you will also have access to the addresses of Azion’s authoritative servers *(Nameservers)* that will answer the queries for your zone.\n   * *Records*: in this tab, you will see a list of all the records that are part of this zone.\n\n3. Click on the *Records* tab to create a new record or edit an existing one.\n4. To create a new record, click the *Add Record* button and fill in the following fields:\n\n   * Name.\n   * Type.\n   * Value\n   * Time-to-live (TTL), *defined in seconds*.\n   * Policy. \n   \n   See details for each field below.\n\n   #### Name\n\n   Identifier for the newly created *Record*.\n\n   This description is the domain that you want to create. For example: `manager` in [manager.azion.com](https://manager.azion.com/).\n\n   #### Type\n\n   This is the type of record that is being added, such as types A, AAAA, MX or CNAME, among other examples.\n   \n   [(See section *4. Types of supported entries and the respective recommendations that Intelligent DNS follows*)](#types-of-entries).\n\n   See the type options and description below:\n\n   | Type                                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n   |---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n   | A (IPv4 Address)                            | Address Mapping record (A Record), also known as a DNS host record, it stores a hostname and its corresponding IPv4 address.                                                                                                                                                                  |\n   | AAAA (IPv6 Address)                         | IP Version 6 Address record (AAAA Record), it stores a hostname and its corresponding IPv6 address.                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n   | ANAME (Maps a name to another name)         | ALIAS record is a virtual record type created to provide CNAME, like behavior on apex domains.                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n   | CAA (Certification Authority Authorization) | A CAA record allows a DNS domain name holder to specify one or more Certification Authorities (CAs) authorized to issue certificates for that domain or subdomain.                                                                                                                            |\n   | CNAME (Canonical name)                      | Canonical Name record (CNAME Record), it can be used to alias a hostname to another hostname. When a DNS client requests a record that contains a CNAME, which points to another hostname, the DNS resolution process is repeated with the new hostname.                                      |\n   | MX (Mail exchange)                          | Mail exchanger record (MX Record), specifies an SMTP email server for the domain, used to route outgoing emails to an email server.                                                                                                                                                           |\n   | NS (Name Servers)                           | NS-records identify the DNS servers responsible (authoritative) for a zone. A zone should contain one NS-record for each of its own DNS servers (primary and secondaries).                                                                                                                    |\n   | PTR (Reverse DNS lookup)                    | PTR records are used for the Reverse DNS (Domain Name System) lookup. Using the IP address, you can get the associated domain/hostname. An A record should exist for every PTR record. The usage of a reverse DNS setup for a mail server is a good solution.                                 |\n   | SRV (Location of server or service)         | A Service record (SRV record) is a specification of data in the Domain Name System defining the location, for example: the hostname and port number, of servers for specified services. It is defined in RFC 2782, and its type code is 33.                                                   |\n   | TXT (Text)                                  | A TXT record (short for text record) is a type of resource record in the Domain Name System (DNS) used to provide the ability to associate arbitrary text with a host or other name, such as human readable information about a server, network, data center, or other accounting information.|\n\n   #### Value\n\n   This is the DNS response to the registered record, such as an IPv4 address for example.\n   \n   [(See section *5. Rules for filling in values*)](#rules-for-filling)\n\n   #### TTL (seconds):\n\n   This is the time a response can be cached for on a resolver server. Time-to-live (TTL) is a value in an IP packet that tells a network router whether or not the packet has been on the network too long and should be discarded.\n\n   #### Policy\n\n   It allows you to specify which policy Intelligent DNS should consider while resolving requests answered by this record entry.\n\n   > You can select either *Simple* Policy (to use the standard DNS functionality) or *Weighted* Policy (to specify the amount of traffic to send to each Record).\n\n   By choosing the *Weighted* Policy, there will be two more fields to be completed, which are:\n\n   * *Weight:* you can choose a number between 0 and 255 to specify the weight for each record. When you choose 0, Intelligent DNS stops using this record.\n   * *Description:* used to differentiate records with the same *Name* and *Type*.\n\n   > Click the *Save* button to finish creating your record.\n\n   From this point on, this set of information will be synchronized with the **Intelligent DNS** service. Your settings are saved and distributed to the Azion network practically in real time.\n\n   Your domain is now set up and ready to be served by Azion **Intelligent DNS**. To make sure everything is working well, run some of the tests described in the section [*7. Testing my zone*](#test-my-zone).\n\n***\n\n### Record Policies\n\nWhile you are adding or modifying a record on **Intelligent DNS**, you will find the *“Policy“* field. This field is enabled just when you are configuring either A, AAAA, CNAME, ANAME or MX type records. This field lets you to choose between two policies to specify how **Intelligent DNS** should deal with requests answered by this record.\n\n#### Simple Policy\n\nBy selecting *simple policy*, **Intelligent DNS** uses the standard DNS records behavior, routing all the traffic to the specified addresses in the *\"Value\"* field.\n\n#### Weighted Policy\n\nBy selecting *weighted policy*, **Intelligent DNS** allows you to create multiple records with the same *Name* and *Type*, enabling you to specify a Weight that defines how much traffic should be routed to each record. This configuration allows you to load balance your applications or even gradually test new configurations.\n\nBy selecting *weighted policy*, different fields options are displayed:\n\n| Field                    | Description                                                                                                                                               |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Weight<br />*required      | You need to specify a weight value between 0 and 255. Higher values increase the chances of a specific record to be used. Setting 0 disables the record. |\n| Description<br />*optional | You may add a description up to 45 characters to distinguish between records with same Name and Type. <br/>Example: Florida Load Balancer                 |\n\nGiven a set of Weighted Records, with same *Name* and *Type*, the chances of a specific record to be chosen by **Intelligent DNS** is defined by the following formula:\n\n`Weight of the record / Sum of all Weights`\n\n***\n\n## Types of supported entries and the respective recommendations that Intelligent DNS follows\n\n##### To provide record creation, Intelligent DNS supports the following types of DNS entries.\n\n| Type   | Reference                 |\n|--------|---------------------------|\n| A      | RFC1035                   |\n| AAAA   | RFC3596                   |\n| ANAME  | draft-ietf-dnsop-aname-04 |\n| CAA    | RFC8659                   |\n| CNAME  | RFC1035                   |\n| MX     | RFC1035 e RFC7505         |\n| NS     | RFC2782                   |\n| PTR    | RFC1035                   |\n| SRV    | RFC2782                   |\n| TXT    | RFC1035 e RFC1464         |\n\n## Rules for filling in values\n\n| Type  | Restriction rule | Example |\n|-------|------------------|---------|\n| A     | It must be in IPv4 format <br /><br />Maximum of 10 IP addresses (one per line).<br /><br />Only valid IPv4 addresses are accepted as a response. | Name of zone: azion.com<br /><br />Name of record: @ (or blank)<br /><br />Value(s) of response:<br /><br /> 192.209.210.67<br /><br /> 198.199.105.93 |\n| AAAA  | It must be in IPv6 format <br /><br />Maximum of 10 IP addresses (one per line).<br/><br />Only valid IPv6 addresses are accepted as a response. | Name of zone: azion.com<br /><br />Name of record: www<br /><br />Value(s) of response:<br /><br /> 2800:3f0:4001:815::2004 |\n| ANAME | It must be in FQDN format<br /><br />Only one domain for each ANAME type record.<br /><br />Only the domains below from 'azioncdn.net', 'azionedge.net' e 'azionedge.com' are accepted.<br /><br />It can coexist with records of the same name but of different types (MX, TXT etc.) | Name of zone: azion.com<br /><br />Name of record: @<br /><br />Value of response:<br /><br /> 32082s.ha.azioncdn.net |\n| CAA   | The value of the response must follow the format \\[FLAG\\] \\[TAG\\] “\\[VALUE\\]”.<br />Example: 0 issue \"ca.example.net\".<br/><br />It won't be possible to register a CAA type record when the zone already has a CNAME type record.<br /><br />N.B. the tool [SSLmate](https://sslmate.com/) can help when creating and querying. | Flag:  <br />If the flag has a value of 0 (zero), all flags will be switched off. If the flag has a value of 1, the 0 bit (Issuer Critical Flag) is on, i.e. A CA must not send certificates for any FQDN, if the relevant record for that FQDN contains a CAA.<br/><br/>Tag: <br />The tags must be in lower case and must follow the naming convention in the RFC. Example: issue, issuewild, iodef.<br/> <br />Issue: it indicates that the CA of the ACM specified in the value field can send a certificate to your domain or sub-domain.<br/>Issuewild: it indicates that the CA of the ACM specified in the value field can send a wildcard certificate to your domain or sub-domain.<br/> <br />iodef: it indicates that should the CA receive an invalid request for a certificate, it should send a notification to the domain owner. Use url (http/https) or mailto. For example: “mailto:email@domain.com”, “https://url” and \"http://url\".<br /><br />Value:<br />The value must always be between double quotes. For example: “ca.example.com”, and the content will depend on the tag you use.<br />Issue: url or a sequence. For example: “ca.example.net; account=123456” or “ca.example.com”<br />Issuewild: must use a domain with a wildcard. For example: “*.example.com”<br />iodef: a url callback or an email address. For example: “mailto:email@domain”, “https://example.com/callback” and “http://example.com/callback”. |\n| CNAME | It must be in FQDN format <br /><br />Only point it to another domain name, never an IP address.<br /><br />It can’t be added at the level of the root domain.<br /><br />Only one domain is allowed for each CNAME type record.<br /><br />A defined host name in a CNAME record must not include records from other types of resources (MX, A, etc.)<br /><br />CNAME records can point to other CNAME records, but this isn’t considered good practice, as it is inefficient.<br /><br />If a CNAME record is pointing to a record in the same zone, Intelligent DNS will respond to all of them in just one query. |  |\n| MX    | It must be in the format \\[PRIORITY\\] \\[ADDRESS\\].<br /><br />Maximum of 10 IP addresses (one per line). | Name of zone: azion.com<br /><br />Name of record: mail<br /><br />Value(s) of response:<br /><br /> 10 mailserver.example.com<br /><br /> 20 mailserver2.example.com |\n| NS    | It must be in FQDN format or an IP address.<br /><br />Maximum of 10 addresses (one per line).<br /><br />An NS can't be configured by the main domain of the zone (naked domain).<br /><br />It must point to the servers that have authority over that record. | Name of zone: azion.com<br /><br />Name of records: ns<br /><br />Value(s) of response:<br /><br /> ns1.aziondns.net<br /><br /> ns2.aziondns.net |\n| PTR   | Reverse zones lined to IPv6 addresses follow other rules. | 1- Create a new zone, add the following information for DOMAIN:<br /> 0.168.192.in-addr.arpa<br /><br /> 2 - After creating the zone, you must create a type PTR record associated with it, with the following settings:<br /><br />Name of record: 1<br /><br />Value of response: www.exemplo.com |\n| SRV   | The record name must have the following format: '_service._protocol.name'. Example: \"_ldap._tcp.azionsrv\".<br /><br />The response values must be in the format \\[priority\\] \\[weight\\] \\[port\\] \\[target\\].<br /><br />Maximum of 10 records (one per line).<br /><br />It must point to the host name that has an A or AAAA record.<br /><br />Note: You must pay special attention to this, because Intelligent DNS will not validate this automatically. | Name of zone: azion.com<br /><br />Name of record: _ldap._tcp.azionsrv<br /><br />Value(s) of response:<br /><br /> 0 60 5060 bigbox.example.com |\n| TXT   | Limited to 100 characters.<br /><br />Text that is separated by ENTER is considered as different responses by Intelligent DNS | Name of zone: azion.com<br /><br />Name of record: txt<br /><br />Value(s) of response:<br /><br /> This domain name is reserved for use in documentation<br /><br /> \"printer=lpr5\"<br /><br /> \"favorite drink=orange juice\" |\n\nYou can set up a domain, such as *www.azion.com*, to be used as a naked domain, such as *Azion.com*, without the \"www\". There are two options to configure this function:\n\n* Create an A-type entry pointing to your webserver. Then, it will be redirected to Azion. This option may impact your Google ranking.\n* Create an ANAME entry in your DNS and point it to Azion. If you're using a DNS service outside Azion or a domain pointing to another platform, this option may not be supported.\n\n## Using wildcards\n\nA wildcard record is a record that responds to DNS requests by domains that you haven’t defined yet. You can create them for any type, inserting an asterisk (*)  in the record name. For example, imagine that you have the following configuration for a zone whose domain is “*example.com*”:\n\n| Name       | Type | Value                                               |\n|------------|------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| www        | A    | 192.168.0.1<br /><br /> 192.168.0.2<br /><br /> 192.168.0.3 |\n| *          | A    | 1.1.1.1                                             |\n| *.wildcard | A    | 2.2.2.2                                             |\n\n#### This means that:\n\n* If the query is made by *www.example.com*, the response will consist of 3 IP addresses: 192.168.0.1, 192.168.0.2 and 192.168.0. N.B. It isn’t a wildcard, but it is given priority for the response because it correctly meets the record that is queried.\n* If the query is made by *ghost.example.com* the response will be according to the wildcard it found. I.e. The response will be: 1.1.1.1.\n* If the query is made by *another.wildcard.example.com*, the response will be according to the wildcard it found this time, i.e. The response will be: 2.2.2.2.\n* If the query is made by *wrong.record.example.com*, the response will have no value, because there is nothing that corresponds to this structure.\n\n### Restrictions on the use of wildcards\n\nOnly the left-most asterisk followed by a dot will be considered a wildcard. All other asterisks, if any, will be considered as valid characters.\n\n> Asterisks located further to the left that are not followed by a dot will not be considered wildcards.\n\nIt is not allowed to use wildcard characters in SRV type records because it requires a standard format in its name.\n\n***\n\n## Testing my zone \n\nIf you have already set up **Intelligent DNS** as you want and you now want to test it to see if it is processing your information properly, you can test it using the following tools:\n\n### DIG\n\nThe *Domain Information Groper (DIG)* is a network administration command-line tool for querying the DNS. It's useful for network troubleshooting and for educational purposes. It can operate based on command line option and flag arguments, or in batch mode by reading requests from an operating system file. When a specific name server isn't specified in the command invocation, it uses the operating system's default resolver, usually configured in the file `resolv.conf`. Without any arguments, it queries the DNS root zone.\n\nIt's a component of the domain name server software suite *BIND* and, in practice, replaces older tools, such as *“nslookup”* and *“host”*. However, the older tools are still used in a complementary way.\n\nTo test **Intelligent DNS**, you should use one of the *nameservers* listed on the *Main Settings* tab of your Azion registered zone.\n\nFor example, imagine you have the following settings.\n\n| Name | Type | Value                                               | TTL  |\n|------|------|-----------------------------------------------------|------|\n| www  | A    | 192.168.0.1<br /><br /> 192.168.0.2<br /><br /> 192.168.0.3 | 3600 |\n\nTo check how **Intelligent DNS** handles a type \"A\" query, registered to the *“www”* record, type the following command:\n\n`dig A www.example.com @ns1.aziondns.net`\n\nThe response to this will be:\n\n`; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> A www.example.com @ns1.aziondns.net ;; global options: +cmd ;; Got answer: ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 46329 ;; flags: qr aa rd; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 3, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1 ;; WARNING: recursion requested but not available ;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION: ; EDNS: version: 0, flags:; udp: 4096 ;; QUESTION SECTION: ;www.example.com.

If no argument or option is provided, the host prints a brief summary of the command line options and arguments.\n\nFor example, imagine you have the following settings:\n\n| Name | Type | Value                                               | TTL  |\n|------|------|-----------------------------------------------------|------|\n| www  | A    | 192.168.0.1<br /><br /> 192.168.0.2<br /><br /> 192.168.0.3 | 3600 |\n\nTo check how Intelligent DNS handles a type \"A query, registered to the “www” record, type:\n\n`host www.example.com ns1.aziondns.net`\n\nThe response to this will be:\n\n`Using domain server: Name: ns1.aziondns.net Address: 179.191.160.2#53 Aliases: www.example.com has address 192.168.0.1 www.example.com has address 192.168.0.2 www.example.com has address 192.168.0.3`\n\n### NSLOOKUP\n\n*Nslookup* is a tool, common to both Windows and Linux, used to obtain information about DNS records for a particular domain, host or IP.\n\nFor example, imagine you have the following settings:\n\n| Name | Type | Value                                               | TTL  |\n|------|------|-----------------------------------------------------|------|\n| www  | A    | 192.168.0.1<br /><br /> 192.168.0.2<br /><br /> 192.168.0.3 | 3600 |\n\nTo check how Intelligent DNS handles a type \"A\" query, registered to the “www” record, type the following command:\n\n`nslookup www.example.com ns1.aziondns.net`\n\nThe response to this will be:\n\n`Server: ns1.aziondns.net Address: 179.191.160.2#53 Name: www.example.com Address: 192.168.0.1 Name: www.example.com Address: 192.168.0.2 Name: www.example.com Address: 192.168.0.3`\n\n***\n\n## Configuring Intelligent DNS to respond to my domains\n\nIn order for **Intelligent DNS** to become the authority over your zones, you must point it at your DNS registry. For example: `registro.br`, `GoDaddy`, `AWS`.\n\nTo point to your DNS registration, use one of the *nameservers* listed in the *Main Settings* tab of your Azion registered zones.\n\n> It is important to verify that all your records are properly registered and tested at **Intelligent DNS** before making this appointment. Otherwise, you run the risk of having your service unavailable.\n\n## Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) \n\nThe **Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC)** is a feature of the *Domain Name System (DNS)* that authenticates responses to domain name lookups. It doesn't provide privacy protections for those lookups but prevents attackers from manipulating or poisoning the responses to DNS requests.\n\n> Azion’s platform is compatible with DNSSEC. Learn [how to host a DNSSEC zone with Azion](/en/documentation/products/intelligent-dns/dnssec-compatibility/#hosting-DNSSEC-zone-with-Azion).  \n\n## 10. Configuring massive redirection for domain migration\n\n**Edge Function Massive Redirect** is Azion's serverless solution for processing many simultaneous redirects. It can be used where there is a need to change a significant number of addresses, for example, in domain migrations.\n\nTo configure massive redirection for domain migration, access the [Massive Redirect](/en/documentation/use-cases/massive-redirect) documentation. \n",

The Time Filter allows you to refine the event search result, and is selected by default for **Last 15 minutes**. You have the option of filtering with the following time ranges:\n\n* Last 15 minutes\n* Last 30 minutes\n* Last 1 hour\n* Last 3 hours\n* Last 6 hours\n* Last 12 hours\n* Last day\n* Last 2 days\n* Last 3 days\n* Last 5 days\n* Last 7 days\n\n> **Note:** by using the *Custom* field, you can also customize your search by selecting a time range during the last 168 hours.\n\n***\n\n## Filter by\n\nIn the _Filter by_ field, you can optionally filter your search results using a keyword or phrase.\n\nWhen submitting a search with a blank _Filter by_ field, you will get all existing records in the Data Origin for the selected time filter.\n\nThe searches are restricted to a particular field, using the notation: `key='value'`, such as `status='200'`. In this case, you will filter only the records which have these specified pair, value and key. As key, you can use the variables from the tables above, but note that each _Data Source_ has _its own_ list of variables.\n\n> Time filter is done using the **_Time Filter_** or **_Custom_** fields, for this reason it is not possible to use the \"timestamp\" key in the filter.\n\nYou may search for more complex field compositions. Use the notations AND, OR and NOT in the search field to combine the fields, such as `status='200' AND scheme='https'`.\n\nThe _Filter by_ field uses SQL language, therefore you must use “_equals_” (=) after the key and “_single quotes_” ( ' ) around values, for example: `status='200'`.\n\nIf you intend to search for a more generic value, you can use the “_like_” operator instead of “_equals_”, exactly like you use in SQL queries. The final query for this search can be `host like '%mydomain%'`.\n\nDepending on the size of our data, the query limit may exceed. If this happens, please filter by a short time filter.\n\n***\n\n## Refresh\n\nThe search always returns the results ordered by the time of the event, from the most recent to the oldest.\n\nYou can use the Refresh button to update the returned data, repeating the last search performed.\n",

Real-Time Metrics gives you the opportunity to:\n\n- Gain insights on the performance of your application.\n- Examine the availability of your content.\n- Quantify accesses and traffic to your content.\n- See bandwidth savings.\n- Find security threats in real time.\n- Troubleshoot problems in real time.\n- Compare your application's data through different data intervals.\n\nYou can combine your metrics analysis with [Real-Time Events](/en/documentation_products_real_time_events/) to further inspect your logs.\n\nYou can also use the **Azion Grafana plugin** to visualize your metrics. \nWith the **Azion Grafana plugin** you can:\n\n- [Customize your own dashboard](/en/documentation/products/guides/azion-plugin-grafana/)\n- [Use use a pre-built dashboard to view Data Transferred graphs](/en/documentation/products/guides/azion-plugin-grafana-pre-built-dash/)\n\n## Real-Time Metrics data consideration\n\nWhen comparing the data displayed on Real-Time Metrics and Azion Billing data, you may find differences. Real-Time Metrics focuses on performance, using an at-most-once approach, while Billing seeks precision, using an exactly-once approach. If you find such differences, you should consider Azion Billing data as the correct one.\n\nOn average, the difference between the two is smaller than 1%. See [Azion Pricing](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/) and the [Billing documentation](/en/documentation/products/accounts/billing/) for more information.\n\n---\n\n## Access\n\nTo access Real-Time Metrics, [contact the Support team](/en/documentation/services/support/#3-service-channels) and request access to **Historical Real-Time Metrics**. You'll receive the access link to the data source you want to analyze.\n\nSee the [Historical Real-Time Metrics first steps](/en/documentation/products/historical-real-time-metrics/first-steps/).\n\n---\n\n## Navigating through tabs\n\nAfter selecting one of the product's tabs, you'll see the available graphs for that specific product according to the data on your account. If you select Data Streaming, for example, you'll see graphs related to the data streamings configured in your account.\n\nThe products also have subtabs, which separate different types of metrics for the same product, and some have several subtabs. The tabs and subtabs are divided as:\n\n- Data Streaming\n    - Data Streamed\n    - Data Streaming Requests\n\n- Edge Applications\n    - Data Transferred\n    - Requests\n    - Status Codes\n    - HTTP Methods\n    - WAF\n    - Bandwidth Saving\n\n- Edge Functions\n    - Invocations\n\n- Intelligent DNS\n    - Standard Queries\n\n- Image Processor\n    - Requests\n\n[Data Streaming](/en/documentation/products/data-streaming/), [Edge Functions](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-functions/), [Intelligent DNS](/en/documentation/products/intelligent-dns/), and [Image Processor](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/image-processor/) are paid products. To view their metrics, you must subscribe to the products and activate them in your account.\n\n---\n\n## Configuring filters\n\nAfter you select the product you'll be analyzing, you need to configure the filters to fetch data for your graphs.\n\nOn Real-Time Metrics' screen, just before the section with the charts, you find the filters according to the product you've chosen. Find out more about the configurations for each product tab next.\n\n[Data Streaming](#data-streaming) _-_ [Edge Applications](#edge-applications) _-_ [Edge Functions](#edge-functions) _-_ [Intelligent DNS](#intelligent-dns) _-_ [Image Processor](#image-processor)\n\n### Data Streaming\n\n- **Time Range**: dropdown menu to select the time period you want to use to exhibit data on your graphs.

Real-Time Metrics focuses on performance, using an at-most-once approach, while Billing seeks precision, using an exactly-once approach. If you find such differences, you should consider Azion Billing data as the correct one.\n\nOn average, the difference between the two is smaller than 1%. See [Azion Pricing](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/) and the [Billing documentation](/en/documentation/products/accounts/billing/) for more information.\n\n---\n\n## Accessing Real-Time Metrics\n\nYou are about to get real-time insights from your applications. Get started with Real-Time Metrics as follows:\n\n* Enter **[Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/)**, go to the **Products Menu** and click on **Real-Time Metrics** in the **Observe** section.\n\nYou’ll be directed to the Real-Time Metrics page, which displays the Edge Applications product graphs by default.\n\n***\n\n## Basics \n\nThe Real-Time Metrics screen is composed of the _Data Interval Filter_ section and the _Data_ section.\n\n* _Data Interval Filter_ section: where you set the domain or the period that you would like to check out.\n* _Data_ section: where graphs are displayed according to your filter selection.\n\nReal-Time Metrics enables you to apply filters to focus on a variety  of data by simply selecting a period or domain you want to analyze.\n\n> As you hover the mouse over the graphs, you’ll get the exact values for each moment in the selected period.\n\n***\n\n## Selecting your Data Interval Filter\n\nAs you access Real-Time Metrics, you’ll see checkboxes on top of the page with the filter options available for that product.\n\nAll the graph options for the products in Real-Time Metrics have the  Data Interval Filter. Some graphs allow you to filter by domain as  follows:\n\n1. Select the domain from the _Configurations_ list and the time interval from the _Time Range_ list;\n2. Click on the **Filter** button to apply your selections.\n\nThe graphs are updated and the information is displayed accordingly.\n\n> Note that the graphs presented will vary according to the products you have contracted.\n\n***\n\n## Exporting to CSV \n\nYou can export graph's information as a CSV file. After applying the filters, click on the **CSV** icon on the upper-right corner of the graph you want to export. Data will be exported according to the information displayed on the graph, the time range you've applied, and with the interval of minutes, hours, or days.\n\n***\n\n## Interpreting your Graphs\n\nThe information is displayed according to the product and period of time selected in the filters. Graphs will be grouped in tabs as described in the section _Tracking your Applications_.\n\n***\n\n## Tracking your Applications \n\nData is key when making decisions. Real-Time Metrics offers you a  variety of options displayed in tabs, so you can support your actions  more effectively.\n\nYou can also use the **Azion Grafana plugin** to visualize your metrics. You can:\n\n- [Customize your own dashboard](/en/documentation/products/guides/azion-plugin-grafana/)\n- [Use use a pre-built dashboard to view Data Transferred graphs](/en/documentation/products/guides/azion-plugin-grafana-pre-built-dash/)\n\nCheck out the function of these tabs as follows:\n\n[Data Transferred](#DataTransferred) _-_ [Requests](#Requests) _-_ [Status Codes](#StatusCodes) _-_ [HTTP Methods](#HTTPMethods) _-_ [WAF](#WAF) _-_ [Bandwidth Saving](#BandwidthSaving)\n\n***\n\n### Data Transferred\n\nThis tab displays graphs referring to the amount of data transferred for the product and period you have selected as described here.\n\n#### Edge Caching\n\nEdge Caching is the standard feature available for all Edge Applications at Azion. It provides a first layer of caching to the client content on Azion Edges. This graph shows the sum of data (*Saved Data* + *Missed Data*) transferred for the product and period you have selected. At the bottom of the graph, you will see the total amount of data (Edge Application *In* + Edge Application *Out*) transferred for the product and period you have selected.\n\nIn order to track and properly account the data that was sent or received using the standard Edge Caching product, we can distinguish the following data transferred:\n\n- **Edge Application In**: data transferred from the user to the Edges, and from the Edges to the client origin.\n\n![Edge Application IN](/assets/docs/images/uploads/edge-applications-in.png)\n\n- **Edge Applications Out**: data transferred from the client origin to the Edges, and from the Edges to the user.\n\n![Edge Application OUT](/assets/docs/images/uploads/edge-applications-out.png)\n\n- **Edge Applications**: all data that was transferred in the process. The value of Edge Applications In + Edge Applications Out.\n\n![Edge Applications](/assets/docs/images/uploads/edge-applications.png)\n\n#### Edge Caching with L2 Enabled\n\nL2 Caching is an add-on that expands the Edge Caching versatility, providing an extra layer of cached content before the client origin. \n\nIn order to track and properly account the data that was sent or received using the Edge Caching product with the L2 Caching enabled, we can distinguish the following data transferred:\n\n- **Edge Applications In**: data transferred from the user to the Edges, and from the Edges to the L2 Caching.\n\n![Edge Applications IN](/assets/docs/images/uploads/l2-enabled-edge-applications-in.png)\n\n- **Edge Applications Out**: data transferred from the L2 Caching to the Edges, and from the Edges to the user.\n\n![Edge Applications OUT](/assets/docs/images/uploads/l2-enabled-edge-applications-out.png)\n\n- **Edge Applications**: all data that was transferred in the process. The value of Edge Applications In + Edge Applications Out.\n\n![Edge Applications](/assets/docs/images/uploads/l2-enabled-edge-applications.png)\n\n#### L2 Caching\n\nL2 Caching is an optional feature for Edge Applications that adds an additional layer of cache between the Azion Edges and the client origin. Additionally to displaying the total *L2 Caching*, you will also get the data on *L2 Caching In* + *L2 Caching Out* displayed separately at the bottom of the graph.\n\nIn order to track and properly account the data that was sent or received using L2 Caching, we can distinguish the following data transferred:\n\n- **L2 Caching In**: data transferred from the Edges, through L2 Caching until the client origin. \n\n![L2 Caching IN](/assets/docs/images/uploads/l2-caching-in.png)\n\n- **L2 Caching Out**: data transferred from the client origin, through L2 Caching to the Azion Edges.\n\n![L2 Caching OUT](/assets/docs/images/uploads/l2-caching-out.png)\n\n- **L2 Caching**: all data that was transferred in the process. The value of L2 Caching In + L2 Caching Out.\n\n![L2 Caching](/assets/docs/images/uploads/l2-caching.png)\n\n#### Edge Offload\n\nThis graph displays the percentage of the amount of data delivered by the Azion product. It displays the _Saved Data_ graph in percentages. You'll see the averages for the selected period displayed at the bottom of the graph.\n\n#### L2 Offload\n\nThis graph displays _L2 Caching_ in percentages. It refers to the amount of data delivered by the origin server. You'll get _L2 Caching_ data for the selected period at the bottom of the graph.\n\n#### Saved Data\n\nThis graph displays the sum of  data delivered by Azion servers, without looking up content on the origin server. You'll see the total amount for the selected period  displayed at the bottom of the graph.\n\n#### Missed Data\n\nThis graph displays the sum of bytes delivered by Azion (edge to end-user) plus the sum of bytes retrieved from origin (origin to edge) for the requests that were not cached or forced the data retrieval from the origin. For example: Cache revalidation, Bypass, Miss, POST requests, etc. You'll have to consider that when delivering content to the end-user, you may have rules that change the total bytes of the request, like removing or adding headers directly in the edge. Therefore, it is expected to have different values for what came out from your origin and what was really delivered to your end users. So, when measuring the amount of bytes that were fetched from your origin by the Azion Edge platform, consider that the _Missed Data_ value may reflect roughly two times what you measured at your origin.\n\nYou'll see the total amount for the selected period displayed at the bottom of the graph.\n\n### Bandwidth Usage\n\n**Total Bandwidth Usage:**  Quantity of MBps in  bandwidth used. You'll see the average bandwidth used during the  selected period displayed at the bottom of the graph.\n\n**Bandwidth Offloaded:** Percentage of the bandwidth  that was offloaded. You'll see the average bandwidth used during the  selected period displayed at the bottom of the graph.\n\n**Saved Bandwidth:** Quantity of MBps of  bandwidth that was delivered directly through the Edge Network, without  looking up content on the origin server.\n\nYou'll see the average bandwidth used during the selected period displayed at the bottom of the graph.\n\n**Missed Bandwidth:** Quantity of MBps of bandwidth used by the origin server searching for content.\n\n***\n\n### Requests\n\n**Total Number of Requests:** Quantity of requests made  for content. You'll see the total of requests during the selected period displayed at the bottom of the graph.\n\n**Saved Requests:** Quantity of requests  delivered by the Azion servers without looking up content on the origin server. You'll see the total number of requests delivered during the  selected period displayed at the bottom of the graph.\n\n**Missed Requests:** The amount of requests  delivered by the origin server. It means that the request was made to the  Azion servers but the content had not been transferred from the origin server to Azion.\n\nYou'll see the total number of requests delivered by  the origin server during the selected period displayed at the bottom of  the graph.\n\n#### **Requests per Second**\n\n**Total Requests per Second:** The amount of requests  per second, from customers for content. You'll see the average number of requests per second during the selected period displayed at the bottom  of the graph.\n\n**Requests per Second Offloaded:** Percentage of the  requests per second delivered by the Azion servers without looking up  content on the origin server. You'll see the average for the selected  period is at the bottom of the graph.\n\n**Saved Requests per Second:** Quantity of  requests per second delivered by the Azion servers without looking up  content on the origin server. You'll see the average number of requests  delivered during the selected period displayed at the bottom of the  graph.\n\n**Missed Requests per Second:** The amount of  requests per second delivered by the origin server. It means that the  request went to the Azion servers but the content had not been  transferred from the origin server to Azion.\n\nYou'll see the average  number of requests per second during the selected period displayed at  the bottom of the graph.\n\n***\n\n### Status Codes \n\nThis tab displays the graphs with information related to the Status  Codes of the content delivered. Learn more about the HTTP Status Codes  at [List of HTTP Status Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes).\n\n**HTTP Status Codes 2xx:** This type of status indicates that the user request was received, understood, accepted and processed by the server.\n\n| Code | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| 200 | OK: Standard status for a successful HTTP request. It means that the content was delivered to the user correctly. |\n| 204 | No Content: It means that the server completed the request, but had no content to deliver. |\n| 206 | Partial Content: The server delivered only a part of the content because it was divided into parts. |\n| 2xx | Other Status: There can be other types of Status for requests that have also been handled, but they are not common. |\n\n**HTTP Status Codes 3xx**: This type of status code indicates that the user request was redirected and needs to go through another stage to be delivered.\n\n| Code | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| 301 | Moved Permanently: This and all future requests will be redirected to another URL. |\n| 302 | Found: This request was temporarily redirected to another URL. |\n| 304 | Not Modified: The content header indicates that the it has not been modified and does not need to be resent. It can deliver the existing file to the user’s browser. |\n| 3xx | Redirection: There can be other types of Status for requests that were also redirected, but they are not common. |\n\n**HTTP Status Codes 4xx**: This type of status code indicates that an error has occurred with the user’s request.\n\n| Code | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| 400 | Bad request: The server cannot process the request, generally this is due to an error with the request format. |\n| 403 | Forbidden: The request is valid, but was not  authorized by the server. This means that the user or the IP that is  making the request is not authorized to do so. |\n| 404 | Not Found: The file that the request was for does not exist on the origin server. |\n| 4xx | Client Error: There can be other types of Status for requests that also generate errors, but they are not common. |\n\n**HTTP Status Codes 5xx**: This type of status indicates that the server failed to deliver an apparently valid request.\n\n| Code | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| 500 | Internal Server Error: This is the generic message given, when an unexpected error occurs on the server and it is unable to handle the request. |\n| 502 | Bad Gateway: When the server is acting as a Gateway or Proxy and receives an invalid response from the origin. It generally occurs when the origin server is offline. |\n| 503 | Service Unavailable: Server is not available. Generally a temporary Status. |\n| 5xx | Server Error: There can be other types of Status for requests that also generate errors, but they are not common. |\n\n***\n\n### HTTP Methods\n\nThis graph shows the requests for your site divided by the HTTP method used. Learn more about the HTTP Methods at [ Hypertext Transfer Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol).\n\n| Method | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| GET | This request method only receives data from the server. |\n| POST | This request method sends data to the server. |\n| HEAD | This request method is the same as GET, but the body of the HTML page is not sent, only the header. |\n| OTHERS | Other request methods, which are not so common, are grouped together here. |\n\n***\n\n### WAF - Web Application Firewall\n\nFor clients who have the Web Application Firewall product, there is a specific graph to display the request behavior.\n\n**Threats vs Requests:** This graph displays the average of blocked attacks for the selected period.\n\n**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Threats:** This graph  displays the average of Cross-Site Scripting attacks.

Welcome to iDNS example\")\n  \n      fmt.Println(\"Please, provide your Personal Token: \")\n      fmt.Scanf(\"%s\", &personalToken)\n  \n      err := IDNSHandler(personalToken)\n      if err != nil {\n          fmt.Println(err)\n      }\n  \n  }\n  \n  // IDNSHandler\n  //\n  //   - I/O operations - asks and reads domain name e zone\n  //   - Instantiates a new client\n  //   - Calls NewIdns\n  func IDNSHandler(personalToken string) error {\n      var domainName, dnsZone string\n      active := true\n  \n      reader := bufio.NewReader(os.Stdin)\n  \n      fmt.Println(\"Plase, provide the Domain Name: \")\n      domainName, err := reader.ReadString('\\n')\n      if err != nil {\n          return err\n      }\n      domainName = strings.Replace(domainName, \"\\n\", \"\", -1)\n  \n      fmt.Println(\"Enter a dns zone: \")\n      dnsZone, err = reader.ReadString('\\n')\n      if err != nil {\n          return err\n      }\n      dnsZone = strings.Replace(dnsZone, \"\\n\", \"\", -1)\n  \n      var f *http.Client\n  \n      client := NewClient(f, intelligentDnsURL, personalToken)\n      err = client.NewIdns(&domainName, &dnsZone, &active)\n      if err != nil {\n          fmt.Println(err)\n          return err\n      }\n      return nil\n  }\n  \n  // NewIdns\n  //   - Instantiate a sdk.Zone object\n  //   - Instantiate the request and exec it\n  //   - Prints success or error\n  func (c *Client) NewIdns(domainName, domain *string, active *bool) error {\n      ctx := context.Background()\n      idns := new(sdk.Zone)\n      idns.Name = domainName\n      idns.Domain = domain\n      idns.IsActive = active\n  \n      fmt.Println(\"Creating iDNS zone....\")\n  \n      req := c.apiClient.ZonesApi.PostZone(ctx).Zone(*idns)\n      _, httpResp, err := req.Execute()\n      if err != nil {\n          fmt.Println(httpResp)\n          return err\n      }\n      bytes, err := io.ReadAll(httpResp.Body)\n      if err != nil {\n          return err\n      }\n  \n      fmt.Println(string(bytes))\n      return nil\n  }\n  \n  // NewClient\n  //   - Instantiates a new skd-api client\n  //   - Set headers\n  func NewClient(f *http.Client, url string, token string) *Client {\n  \n      conf := sdk.NewConfiguration()\n  \n      conf.HTTPClient = f\n      conf.AddDefaultHeader(\"Authorization\", \"token \"+token)\n      conf.AddDefaultHeader(\"Accept\", \"application/json;version=3\")\n      conf.Servers = sdk.ServerConfigurations{\n          {URL: url},\n      }\n  \n      return &Client{\n          apiClient: *sdk.NewAPIClient(conf),\n      }\n  }\n  \n```\n\n## Explaining the example \n\nLearn about the implementation of the Azion API SDK by analyzing the steps of the creation of a new Intelligent DNS zone.\n\n### Instantiating a Client \n\nThe Go client abstracts away the complexity of the underlying service or API, making it easier for developers to integrate with it.\n\nTo instantiate a client, you have to:\n\n1. Import the package you want to use. In this example, you'll create a new Intelligent DNS zone.\n\n```go\n  import(\n      sdk \"github.com/aziontech/azionapi-go-sdk/idns\"\n  )\n```\n\n2. Instantiate the client:\n\n```go\n  // Client is used to instantiate a Azion API Client \n  type Client struct {\n      apiClient sdk.APIClient\n  }  \n  // NewClient\n  //  - Receives:\n  //  A *http.Client\n  //  The base path to the API you want to consume. ex: https://api.azionapi.net/\n  //  The Azion Personal Token\n  func NewClient(f * http.Client, url string, token string) * Client {\n      conf: = sdk.NewConfiguration()\n      conf.HTTPClient = f\n      conf.AddDefaultHeader(\"Authorization\", \"token \" + token)\n      conf.AddDefaultHeader(\"Accept\", \"application/json;version=3\")\n      conf.Servers = sdk.ServerConfigurations {\n          {\n              URL: url\n          },\n      }\n      // Returns a ready to use client\n      return &Client {\n          apiClient: * sdk.NewAPIClient(conf),\n      }\n  }\n```\n\n### Creating an Intelligent DNS zone \n\nTake a look at the creation of an Intelligent DNS zone using the SDK:\n\n```go\n  // NewIdns\n  //   - Instantiate a sdk.Zone object\n  //   - Instantiate the request and exec it\n  func(c * Client) NewIdns(domainName, domain * string, active * bool) error {\n      // Instantiate a ctx variable\n      ctx: = context.Background()\n          // From the section iDNS of the SDK, we initialize a sdk.Zone object\n          // Informing the required values for creating an iDNS zone.\n      idns: = new(sdk.Zone)\n      idns.Name = domainName\n      idns.Domain = domain\n      idns.IsActive = active\n      // Make use of the PostZone Method, passing the idns zone object\n      req: = c.apiClient.ZonesApi.PostZone(ctx).Zone( * idns)\n      res,\n      httpResp,\n      err: = req.Execute()\n      if err != nil {\n          return err\n      }\n      // Here, the logic related to the response is applied...\n \n      fmt.Println(res, httpResp)\n      return nil\n  }\n```\n\n---\n\n## Available APIs\n\nThe Azion SDK offers management to the following services:\n\n- [Domains](https://github.com/aziontech/azionapi-go-sdk/blob/master/domains/README.md)\n- [Edge Applications](https://github.com/aziontech/azionapi-go-sdk/blob/master/edgeapplications/README.md)\n- [Edge Functions](https://github.com/aziontech/azionapi-go-sdk/blob/master/edgefunctions/README.md)\n- [Edge Services](https://github.com/aziontech/azionapi-go-sdk/blob/master/edgeservices/README.md)\n- [Intelligent DNS](https://github.com/aziontech/azionapi-go-sdk/blob/master/idns/README.md)\n- [Real-Time Purge](https://github.com/aziontech/azionapi-go-sdk/blob/master/realtimepurge/README.md)\n",

    "body": "\n[Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/docs) is an infrastructure as code tool that makes it possible to manage your infrastructure efficiently through code. The files created to manage your infrastructure can be reused, versioned, and shared, helping you to have a consistent workflow to provision and manage all of your infrastructure throughout its lifecycle.\n\n---\n\n## How does Azion Terraform Provider work?\n\n**Terraform** works based [on providers](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/registry/providers). A provider is in charge of managing the lifecycle of a particular resource type. They're implemented as plugins, which are separate executable code files that may be loaded into Terraform at runtime.\n\n[Azion Terraform Provider](https://github.com/aziontech/terraform-provider-azion) is an open source project, registered in [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/aziontech/azion/latest) that uses [the Azion SDK (Go)](https://github.com/aziontech/azionapi-go-sdk) to communicate with the Azion APIs, so you can manage your infrastructure hosted on the Azion platform, locally, as code.\n\n---\n\n## Process\n\n![Azion Terraform Provider Process](/assets/docs/images/uploads/terraformProviderFlow.png)\n\n**Terraform Core**: it communicates with the Azion Terraform Provider.\n\n> **Note**: you must have Terraform Core installed in your environment. [See how to install it](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads).\n\n**Azion Terraform Provider**: built in Go, it communicates with the Azion SDK (Go).\n\n**Azion SDK (Go)**: it communicates with the Azion APIs.\n\n---\n\n## First steps\n\nIn your `.tf` file, you must set the **Azion Terraform Provider** as the provider and set its version as well, such as:\n\n```json\n    required_providers {\n        source = \"aziontech/azion\"\n        version =  \"1.x.y\" // it depends on the version you're willing to use.\n    }\n```\n\nWith the provider configured, it's recommended to configure a [personal token](/en/documentation/products/accounts/personal-tokens/):\n\n```json\n    provider \"azion\" {\n      api_token  = \"token\" // Here you place your personal token\n    }\n```\n\n> **Note**: if the personal token isn't provided as presented above, a prompt will ask you to inform it when you try to run any Terraform command.\n\nAfter these steps, you're ready to get started managing your infrastructure using the Azion Terraform Provider.\n\nHere's how your `.tf` should look like at this point:\n\n```json\n    required_providers {\n            source = \"aziontech/azion\"\n            version = \"1.x.y\" // it depends on the version you're willing to use.\n        }\n    provider \"azion\" {\n            api_token  = \"token\" // Here you place your personal token\n     }\n```\n\n---\n\n## Implementation\n\n| Scope | Resource | Data source |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Domains | [Managing domains](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/aziontech/azion/latest/docs/resources/domain) | [Consulting domains](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/aziontech/azion/latest/docs/data-sources/domains) |\n| Edge Functions | [Managing edge functions](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/aziontech/azion/latest/docs/resources/edge_function) | [Consulting edge functions](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/aziontech/azion/latest/docs/data-sources/edge_functions) |\n|  Intelligent DNS Zones | [Managing zones](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/aziontech/azion/latest/docs/resources/intelligent_dns_zone)| [Consulting zones](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/aziontech/azion/latest/docs/data-sources/intelligent_dns_zones) |\n|  Intelligent DNS Records | [Managing records](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/aziontech/azion/latest/docs/resources/intelligent_dns_record) | [Consulting records](https://github.com/aziontech/terraform-provider-azion/blob/main/docs/data-sources/records.md)|\n|  Intelligent DNS DNSSEC | [Managing DNSSEC](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/aziontech/azion/latest/docs/resources/intelligent_dns_dnssec) | [Consulting DNSSEC](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/aziontech/azion/latest/docs/data-sources/intelligent_dns_dnssec)|\n|  Edge Application Edge Functions Instances | [Managing Edge Functions Instances](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/aziontech/azion/latest/docs/resources/edge_application_edge_functions_instance) | [Consulting Edge Functions Instances](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/aziontech/azion/latest/docs/data-sources/edge_application_edge_functions_instance)|\n|  Edge Application Origin | [Managing Origins](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/aziontech/azion/latest/docs/resources/edge_application_origin) | [Consulting Origins](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/aziontech/azion/latest/docs/data-sources/edge_applications_origins)|\n",

    "body": "\nO logon único (SSO) permite que você conceda aos membros de sua equipe uma conta para todos os sistemas que sua empresa usa. Se você tiver uma conta Azion Enterprise e tiver o SSO configurado para sua empresa, seus usuários poderão fazer o login no **Real-Time Manager (RTM)** usando suas credenciais de SSO.\n\nSomente usuários com privilégio de *Account Owner* podem configurar o *login* dos membros do time entre duas opções de autenticação de conta: **Azion SSO** ou um **Identity Provider (IdP)** externo.\n\n## Definições\n\n* **Identity Provider (IdP)**: é uma entidade confiável que permite habilitar o logon único para acessar outros sites ou serviços, como os da Azion. Seus usuários podem continuar usando suas identidades de usuários corporativos sem precisar lembrar de uma senha específica ou digitar credenciais cada vez que for acessar o RTM. Um exemplo de provedor de identidade é o Azure.\n* **Service Provider**: a Azion, neste contexto, é o provedor de serviços configurado como uma aplicação em um provedor de identidade para habilitar o logon único.\n* **Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)**: é um protocolo de padrão aberto para troca de dados de autenticação e autorização entre as partes, em particular, entre um Provedor de Identidade e um Provedor de Serviços. SAML é uma linguagem de marcação baseada em XML para declarações de segurança (declarações que os provedores de serviços usam para tomar decisões de controle de acesso). A Azion suporta o protocolo SAML, versão 2.0.\n* **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**: o OpenID Connect é um protocolo de identidade de padrão aberto que usa o OAuth 2.0 para autenticação e autorização e, em seguida, constrói identidades que identificam os usuários exclusivamente.\n\n## Configurar a integração SSO no RTM\n\nApós criar uma aplicação SSO no seu provedor de identidade, proceda conforme a seguir para configurar essa integração no RTM:\n\n1. Acesse **[Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/)** com seu usuário e senha.\n2. Entre em **Menu Account** no canto superior direito e selecione **SSO Management**.\n3. Clique no botão **Add Identity Provider** e escolha o protocolo que você deseja cadastrar.\n\nVocê receberá do seu provedor de identidade as informações obrigatórias para preencher o formulário de configuração de cada protocolo. A Azion oferece, nos campos de cada formulário, ajuda para facilitar o seu preenchimento.\n\n* Para saber como configurar um Provedor de Identidade SAML, clique [aqui](https://docs.github.com/pt/github-ae@latest/admin/identity-and-access-management/managing-iam-for-your-enterprise/configuring-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-enterprise).\n* Para saber como configurar um Provedor de Identidade OIDC, clique [aqui](https://docs.github.com/pt/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-cloud-providers).\n\nAo finalizar a configuração de um provedor de identidade, clique em **Save**. Você será redirecionado para a lista de provedores de identidade, onde é possível visualizar todos os provedores criados na sua conta.\n\n> Você pode adicionar quantos provedores de identidade desejar. Contudo, poderá ativar apenas um provedor por vez.\n\n## Editar os dados de um Provedor de Identidade (IdP)\n\n1. Acesse **[Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/)** com seu usuário e senha.\n2. Entre em **Menu Account** no canto superior direito e selecione **SSO Management**.\n3. Clique no ícone de edição (...) para abrir a opção de editar o provedor.\n4. Após fazer as alterações desejadas, clique em **Save**.\n\n> Não é possível excluir um IdP ativo, mas você pode desativá-lo. Caso opte por desativar, basta escolher um outro IdP externo ou o SSO da Azion.\n\n## Alterar o Provedor de Identidade da sua conta\n\n1. Acesse **[Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/)** com seu usuário e senha.\n2. Entre em **Menu Account** no canto superior direito e selecione **SSO Management**.\n3. Selecione o Provedor de identidade que deseja passar a usar.\n4. Em seguida, uma janela de confirmação abrirá.\n5. Confirme a alteração.\n\n## Provedor de Identidade SAML\n\n### Configurar um Provedor de Identidade SAML\n\n1. No [RTM](https://manager.azion.com/), clique em **SSO Management** no **Menu Account**, no canto superior direito.\n2. Clique em **Add Identity Provider** e escolha a opção **SAML**.\n3. Escolha um nome que identifique o provedor de identidade.\n4. Preencha os campos os seguintes campos com os dados copiados do seu provedor de identidade:\n   * Identity provider’s Entity ID URI\n   * Sign-in URL\n   * Certificate\n5. Para finalizar, clique em **Save**. Você será redirecionado para a lista de provedores de identidade, onde pode visualizar todos os provedores criados na sua conta.\n\n#### Completar a configuração da Azion como Provedor de Serviços no seu Provedor de Identidade\n\nPara concluir a configuração da Azion como provedor de serviços no seu provedor de identidade, você precisará das seguintes informações, encontradas no próprio formulário de configuração:\n\n* Login URL\n* Assertion Consumer Service URL\n* Service Provider’s Entity ID URI\n\nCole essas informações no formulário de configuração da aplicação SSO no seu Provedor de Identidade. Pronto! A integração SSO está pronta para ser ativada no RTM.\n\n#### Ativar o Provedor de Identidade no RTM\n\nAntes de ativar um provedor de identidade, confira se a aplicação SSO está devidamente configurada no seu provedor de identidade.\n\nPara ativar um provedor de identidade presente na lista de provedores cadastrados na sua conta no RTM, basta selecioná-lo. Uma confirmação será pedida.

    "body": "\n\nMulti-Factor Authentication (MFA) é um método eletrônico de verificação usado para proteger logins. Com MFA, o usuário deve prover, pelo menos, duas evidências de identidade para acessar a sua conta. Neste caso, funciona com a combinação da senha e uma aplicação no celular.\n\n> Antes de ativar esta configuração no **[Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/)**, certifique-se de que o seu celular é compatível com um app de MFA, como Google Authenticator ou Microsoft Authenticator, buscando em sua loja de aplicativos (App Store no iOS ou Google Play no Android, por exemplo) e fazendo o download.\n\n---\n\n## Habilitar Multi-Factor Authentication no Real-Time Manager\n\nVocê pode habilitar MFA ao criar um novo usuário, ativá-lo para usuários ativos ou assegurar o acesso à sua conta.\n\nHabilitar MFA para o seu usuário:\n\n1. Acesse o **[Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/)**.\n2. Clique em **Account Menu** no canto superior direito e selecione **Your Settings**.\n3. Ative o switch do MFA.\n4. Clique em **Save** para finalizar o processo.\n\n\nHabilitar MFA para usuários existentes:\n\n1. Acesse o **[Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/)**.\n2. Clique em **Account Menu** no canto superior direito e selecione **Users Management**.\n3. Selecione o usuário desejado para acessar seu perfil.\n4. Ative o switch do MFA.\n5. Clique em **Save** para finalizar o processo.\n\n---\n\n## Configurar MFA em um dispositivo móvel\n\nPara instalar uma aplicação de autenticação no seu dispositivo móvel, consulte a loja de apps de seu sistema operacional (como App Store no iOS ou Google Play no Android). Você pode utilizar o Google Authenticator ou Microsoft Authenticator, por exemplo.\n\nUma vez que você instalar a aplicação e realizar o acesso, siga as instruções abaixo para conectar a conta da Azion à sua aplicação autenticadora escolhida:\n\n1. Procure e clique no botão **+**.\n2. Selecione o tipo de conta que será adicionada. A câmera será iniciada.\n3. Escaneie o QR code que aparecerá quando você acessar ao **Real-Time Manager**.\n4. Digite o código de seis dígitos e clique em **Verify Code.**\n\n> Por conta do MFA, é necessário ter acesso ao seu celular para realizar o login ao RTM.\n\n---\n\n## Acessar Real-Time Manager usando MFA\n\nSiga os passos abaixo para entrar no RTM usando o MFA:\n\n1. Na tela de login do RTM, insira suas credenciais de acesso (e-mail e senha) e clique em **Sign In**.\n2. Abra sua aplicação de autenticação no celular.\n3. Digite o código de seis dígitos no campo especificado no RTM e clique em **Verify**.\n\n---\n\n## Redefinir o MFA\n\nEm caso de perda ou roubo de seu celular, não será possível o acesso ao RTM a menos que o *Account owner* redefina a função de MFA. \n\n> A redefinição de Multi-Factor Authentication pode ser feita se a aplicação de MFA não for mandatória para os usuários da conta.\n\nPara tanto, você pode pedir para um usuário com privilégios de *Account owner* desativar o MFA. Caso você seja um *Account Owner*, prossiga conforme a seguir:\n\n1. Acesse o **[Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/)**.\n2. Clique em **Account Menu** no canto superior direito e selecione **Users Management**.\n3. Selecione o usuário desejado para acessar seu perfil.\n4. Desative o switch do MFA.\n5. Clique em **Save** para finalizar o processo.\n\n\nSe você for o único *Account owner* da conta, será necessário entrar em contato com a equipe de [suporte](mailto:support@azion.com) para desativar a função MFA.\n\n## Aplicar o uso de MFA para todos os usuários pertencentes à uma conta\n\nO MFA proporciona um nível extra de segurança para proteger suas credenciais de usuário. A aplicação da autenticação em duas etapas para todos os usuários requer o acesso de gerenciamento de usuários, ou seja, somente usuários com privilégios de *Account Owner* podem habilitar essa configuração. \n\nAplicar a MFA para todos os usuários vinculados à uma conta:\n\n1. Acesse o **[Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/)**.\n\n2. Clique em **Account Menu** no canto superior direito e selecione **Account Settings**.\n\n4. Em **Authentication Settings**, ative o switch **Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication**.\n\n   > Ao ativar este item, a MFA será obrigatória para todos os usuários da conta.\n\n5. Clique em **Save** para finalizar o processo.\n\nPara desabilitar essa configuração, siga os passos acima, desative o switch **Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication** e clique em **Save**.\n\n## Desvincular o uso de MFA da conta de um usuário\n\nÉ possível restaurar o uso de MFA de sua conta caso você tenha perdido ou substituído o telefone usado para autenticar seu login ou queira fazer a autenticação usando um outro dispositivo, como um novo telefone ou computador.\n\nPara tanto, você pode pedir para um usuário com os privilégios de *Account owner* restaurar o MFA. Caso você seja um *Account Owner*, prossiga conforme a seguir:\n\n1. Acesse o **[Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/)**.\n2. Clique em **Account Menu** no canto superior direito e selecione **Users Management**.\n4. Selecione o/os usuários que deseja desvincular o uso de MFA.\n5. Clique no botão **Restore Authenticator** localizado no final da página na seção **Restore Multi-Factor Authenticator**.\n6. No pop-up de verificação, clique em **Restore**.\n\n> A partir desse momento, será necessário que o usuário habilite o autenticador novamente em seu próximo login.\n\n\n\n",

A escolha do fuso horário correto garante precisão ao acessar dados e métricas no RTM.\n**Language**: inglês é o único idioma disponível no RTM no momento.\n\n### Contact information\n\n**Email**: endereço de email do novo usuário, que também servirá como informação de login desse usuário.\n**Mobile**: número de telefone celular do novo usuário.\n\n### Security settings\n\n**Account owner**: ao ativar essa função, o novo usuário será definido como *Account owner*. O usuário terá permissão de acesso a todas as configurações, incluindo a gestão de soluções e de todas as contas. \n\nCom a função desativada, o usuário será definido como *Non-owner*, com acesso restrito de acordo com as configurações de permissões definidas em Teams. \n\n**Teams**: os times possuem permissões de acesso diferentes. Por isso, você deve selecionar um time para alocar os usuários definidos como *Non-owners*, diferentemente do *Account owner*, que possui permissão de acesso a todos os times.  \n\nSe você ainda não criou nenhum time ao adicionar um usuário, você pode escolher o Default Team do [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/).\n\n> As permissões de acesso do usuário Non-owner dependem das permissões concedidas ao time ao qual estiver alocado.\n\nVocê também pode alocar usuários *Non-owners* a mais de um time, o que amplia as possibilidades de permissões de acesso para o mesmo usuário. Veja mais detalhes na [documentação de Teams Permissions]/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/gestao-de-contas/teams-permissions/). \n\n**Multi-Factor Authentication**: essa função habilita/desabilita o Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). O MFA é um método de verificação que garante mais segurança à conta quando ativado.\n\n> A fim de garantir a segurança de dados, mantenha as informações de login de acesso confidenciais.\n\n### Caixas de seleção Available Teams e Chosen Teams\n\n1. Para selecionar os times onde o usuário será alocado, clique sobre o **time** desejado em Available Teams e depois sobre a **seta** para mover sua seleção para a caixa Chosen Teams.  \n\nVocê também pode selecionar mais de um time ao mesmo tempo:\n\n   - Você pode selecionar todos os times de uma só vez através da função *Choose all*, localizada abaixo da caixa Available Teams.\n   - Também é possível selecionar em sequência, mantendo a tecla Shift pressionada enquanto clica sobre as opções desejadas.\n   - Ou, ainda, marcar as seleções de forma alternada ao manter a tecla Ctrl ou Cmd pressionada enquanto clica sobre os times desejados.\n\n2. Você também pode desfazer a sua seleção a qualquer momento. Clique sobre o **time** desejado em Chosen Teams e depois sobre a **seta** para mover sua seleção de volta para a caixa Available Teams. \n\nVocê ainda pode desmarcar todos os times de uma só vez através da função *Clear selection*, localizada abaixo da caixa Chosen Teams. Você também pode usar as teclas Shift, Ctrl ou Cmd, conforme descrito acima.\n\n### Ativar suas configurações\n\nNa parte inferior da tela, você encontra as seguintes opções:\n\n- **Cancel**: com essa opção você retorna à página inicial de Users e descarta qualquer edição.  \n- **Save**: concluídas as configurações, clique em **Save** para salvar suas configurações.  \n\nAo finalizar o processo, você retorna à página Users Management, onde você visualiza a lista de usuários discriminados pelos dados de contato, time ao qual pertencem, status do MFA e se estão ativos ou não.\n\n> O novo usuário receberá um email para ativação da conta, que ficará disponível por 14 dias. Após esse período, se não ativar a conta, será excluído automaticamente do Real-Time Manager.\n\n---\n\n## Modificar informações de usuários\n\nVocê sempre pode alterar as informações de cadastro dos usuários e suas configurações. Siga estas instruções: \n\n1. Acesse o [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/) e selecione **Users Management**, conforme descrito na seção [Acessar Users Management](#Acessarusersmanagement). \n2. Na tela Users Management, selecione o usuário desejado para acessar seu perfil e faça as alterações necessárias.\n\n### Ativar suas configurações\n\nNa parte inferior da tela, você encontra as seguintes opções:\n\n- **Active**: esse botão habilita ou desabilita um usuário no sistema. \n- **Cancel**: com essa opção você retorna à página inicial de Users, também descarta qualquer edição.  \n- **Save**: concluídas as configurações, clique em **Save** para salvar suas configurações.  \n\nAo finalizar o processo, você retorna à página Users Management, onde você visualiza a lista de usuários discriminados pelos dados de contato, time ao qual pertencem, status do MFA e se estão ativos ou não.\n\n> Os usuários também podem modificar as informações deles na página **Your Settings** do RTM. Veja mais informações como fazer as alterações na [documentação](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/gestao-de-contas/your-settings/).\n\n---\n\n## Excluir usuários\n\nPara deletar um usuário, proceda da seguinte maneira:\n\n1. Acesse o [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/) e selecione **Users Management**, conforme descrito na seção [Acessar Users Management](#Acessarusersmanagement).\n2. Na tela **Users Management**, ao passar o cursor do mouse sobre os usuários, o ícone da lixeira será habilitado. Clique sobre a lixeira para deletar o usuário. \n3. Ao clicar sobre a lixeira, aparece uma mensagem solicitando a confirmação da exclusão. Digite a palavra solicitada na caixa de texto.\n4.

Desde já, o Cliente declara ter autoridade legal junto à sociedade que representa e está legalmente apto a celebrar contratos.\n\n## 1\\. Uso dos Produtos e Serviços\n\n1\\.1. O Cliente pode acessar e utilizar os Produtos e Serviços de acordo com este Contrato. Acordo de Nível de Serviço pode ser aplicável a certos Produtos e Serviços, conforme Termos de Serviço. O Cliente deve respeitar a todas as leis, regras e regulamentos aplicáveis ao uso dos Produtos e Serviços, inclusive aos Termos de Serviço, à Política de Uso Aceitável e às outras Políticas, conforme definidas na Cláusula 14.\n\n1\\.2. Para acessar os Produtos e Serviços, o Cliente deverá possuir uma conta Azion associada a um endereço de e-mail válido. As informações para acesso inicial provisório serão enviadas via e-mail pela Azion. Salvo se explicitamente permitido pelos Termos de Serviço, o Cliente poderá criar múltiplas contas de acesso e somente uma conta por endereço de e-mail. O Cliente é o responsável pela definição da política de utilização da senha de acesso e por todas as atividades que ocorrerem sob sua conta, independentemente de essas atividades terem sido realizadas pelo Cliente, seus empregados, ou um terceiro (inclusive seus contratados ou representantes) e, salvo por violação do presente Contrato, a Azion e suas afiliadas não são responsáveis pelo acesso desautorizado à conta do Cliente. O Cliente comunicará imediatamente a Azion caso acredite que um terceiro desautorizado esteja utilizando sua conta ou caso suas informações de conta forem perdidas ou roubadas.\n\n## 2\\. Declaração de Responsabilidade\n\n2\\.1. O Cliente é inteiramente responsável pelo desenvolvimento, implantação, operação, manutenção e uso do Seu Conteúdo, Produtos e Serviços como, por exemplo: (a) operação técnica, inclusive controlando e administrando o uso excedente ao contratado e garantindo que as chamadas efetuadas a qualquer Produto ou Serviço sejam compatíveis com as APIs do Serviço; (b) observância da Política de Uso Aceitável, de outras Políticas e da lei por parte do Seu Conteúdo; (c) quaisquer demandas relativas ao Seu Conteúdo; (d) e pelo tratamento e processamento apropriado dos avisos (ou a quaisquer de suas afiliadas) enviados por quaisquer pessoas que alegam que seu Conteúdo viola os direitos dessa pessoa, inclusive avisos nos termos da Lei de Direitos Autorias Digitais do Milênio (DMCA).\n\n2\\.2. O Cliente afirma estar inteiramente ciente dos riscos envolvidos pelo uso da internet, podendo estes ocasionar significativos prejuízos, sobretudo financeiros, sendo o Cliente exclusivamente responsável em prevenir-se face à existência de tais riscos, dentre os quais se destacam, mas não se limitam, a roubo de Conteúdo (s), roubo de sinal, hotlink, redistribuição imprópria de Conteúdo, ataques hacker, quebra de direito autoral, dentre outros.\n\n2\\.3.

Ainda, assim, caso a Azion seja compelida a despender quaisquer valores em decorrência da demanda, o Cliente reembolsará integralmente a Azion em até 10 (dez) dias úteis contados da data da solicitação.\n\n2\\.4.O Cliente é responsável pela configuração e utilização adequada dos Produtos e Serviços e pela tomada de precauções para manter a segurança, proteção e backup apropriado do seu Seu Conteúdo, o que poderá incluir o uso de tecnologia de criptografia para proteger Seu Conteúdo do acesso desautorizado e a cópia de segurança rotineira do Seu Conteúdo.\n\n2\\.5.

O Cliente será o único responsável pelo uso dos Produtos e Serviços, pelos Usuários Finais e pelo Seu Conteúdo, devendo assegurar que todos os Usuários Finais observem suas obrigações nos termos do presente Contrato e que os termos do Contrato com cada Usuário Final sejam condizentes com este Contrato. Caso o Cliente tome conhecimento de qualquer violação de suas obrigações, nos termos deste Contrato, por um Usuário Final, deverá encerrar imediatamente o acesso desse usuário ao Seu Conteúdo, Produtos e Serviços.\n\n## 3\\. Avisos\n\n3\\.1. A Azion deve fornecer-lhe aviso: (a) postando um aviso no Azion Real Time Manager; ou (b) enviando uma mensagem aos endereços de e-mail então associados a conta do Cliente. Os avisos postados no Site da Azion ou Azion Real Time Manager vigorarão quando da sua publicação online, sendo que os avisos enviados por e-mail vigorarão quando enviarmos o e-mail, independentemente do Cliente tê-lo realmente recebido ou não, sendo responsabilidade do Cliente manter um endereço de e-mail funcional para recepção dos comunicados.\n\n3\\.2. Qualquer notificação que o Cliente precisar fazer à Azion, para tudo o que seja decorrente do presente Contrato, se formalizará por escrito e será considerado entregue com a confirmação de recebimento em mãos, por serviço de entrega expressa, carta protocolada ou carta registrada para Azion, para o endereço que consta no início deste Contrato.

A Azion poderá suspender o seu direito ou o direito de qualquer Usuário Final de acesso ou uso de quaisquer parcelas ou de todos os Produtos e Serviços imediatamente, mediante aviso, se:\n\n(a) O uso ou contratação dos Produtos e Serviços pelo Cliente ou Usuário Final (i) representa um risco de segurança aos Produtos e Serviços ou a qualquer terceiro; (ii) venha prejudicar os Produtos e Serviços, os sistemas ou o Conteúdo de qualquer outro cliente Azion; (iii) venha acarretar responsabilidade por parte da Azion, das suas afiliadas e de quaisquer terceiros; (iv) não esteja de acordo com as documentações e boas práticas sugeridas pela Azion, ou (v) possa ser fraudulento;\n\n(b) O Cliente ou qualquer Usuário Final violou o presente Contrato, inclusive se o Cliente faltou com a verdade em relação as informações cadastrais ou a respeito da titularidade de direito autoral sobre os Seus Conteúdos;\n\n(c) O Cliente estiver em atraso com suas obrigações de pagamento, incluindo os eventuais custos por utilização excedente, por mais de 5 (cinco) dias; ou\n\n(d) O Cliente deixar de operar no curso regular, efetuar uma cessão em benefício de credores ou alienação similar dos seus ativos, ou ficou sujeito à falência, recuperação, liquidação, dissolução ou procedimento similar.\n\n5\\.2. Se a Azion suspender os direitos de acesso do Cliente, bem como o uso de qualquer parcela ou de todos os Produtos e Serviços:\n\n(a) Os dias de suspensão não serão descontados e nem compensados em cobranças futuras;\n\n(b) O Cliente permanecerá sendo o único responsável pelo(s) valores aplicáveis ao Contrato, com relação a quaisquer Produtos e Serviços aos quais continua a ter acesso;\n\n(c) A Azion não apagará qualquer parte do Seu Conteúdo, como resultado da sua suspensão, salvo se especificado em qualquer outra parte deste Contrato.\n\n5\\.3. O direito da Azion de suspender o acesso ou uso do Cliente ou uso de qualquer Usuário Final é adicional ao direito de rescindir este Contrato nos termos da Cláusula 6.\n\n## 6\\. Vigência e Rescisão\n\n6\\.1. O presente Contrato entrará em vigor quando o Cliente utilizar ou realizar acesso a quaisquer dos Produtos e Serviços Azion pela primeira vez e poderá ser rescindido por qualquer das Partes, por qualquer motivo: (i) enviando aviso prévio e (ii) encerrando a conta do Cliente para todos os serviços para os quais a Azion fornece um mecanismo de encerramento de conta online. Este Contrato também poderá ainda ser rescindido por justa causa, à qualquer momento, se houver qualquer inadimplemento ou violação substancial deste Contrato pela outra Parte, e desde que a Parte inadimplente não tenha sanado a falha ou a violação material dentro do prazo de 30 (trinta) dias que lhe será concedido pela Parte prejudicada, mediante aviso prévio a ser enviado quando da identificação da falha ou descumprimento material.\n\n6\\.2. A Azion também poderá rescindir este Contrato imediatamente, sem necessidade de aviso prévio (a) por justa causa, se qualquer ato ou omissão praticada pelo Cliente ou por qualquer Usuário Final resultar na suspensão descrita na Cláusula 6.1; (b) se o relacionamento da Azion com um terceiro parceiro, que fornece o software ou outra tecnologia que é utilizada pela Azion para fornecer os Produtos e Serviços findar, terminar ou exigir que seja alterada a forma que fornecemos o software ou outra tecnologia; (c) se a Azion acreditar que o fornecimento dos Produtos e Serviços poderá criar um ônus técnico ou econômico ou risco de segurança substancial para a Azion; (d) para observar a lei ou exigências de entidades governamentais; ou (e) se o uso dos Produtos e Serviços pelo Cliente ou qualquer Usuário Final ou ainda se a prestação de quaisquer dos Produtos e Serviços pela Azion ao Cliente ou a qualquer Usuário Final se tornou impraticável ou inviável por qualquer razão legal ou regulamentar.\n\n6\\.3. Mediante a rescisão deste Contrato: (i) todos os direitos do Cliente aqui pactuados serão extintos imediatamente; (ii) o Cliente permanece sendo o responsável por todos os haveres, incluindo todos os valores contratados como Preço *On Demand* e Preço por Capacidade Reservada, além de excedentes e todas as taxas e despesas incorridas; (iii) o Cliente devolverá imediatamente ou, destruirá todo o Conteúdo Azion em sua posse, à critério da Azion; e (iv) as Cláusulas 2.1, 6.3, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 continuarão aplicáveis de acordo com seus termos.\n\n6\\.4. Salvo se a Azion encerrar o uso dos Produtos e Serviços para o Cliente, nos termos da Cláusula 6.2, durante os 10 (dez) dias subsequentes à rescisão: (i) a Azion não apagará quaisquer dos Seus Conteúdos como resultado da rescisão; (ii) o Cliente poderá recuperar Seu Conteúdo somente se tiver quitado quaisquer haveres, taxas e despesas de uso pós-rescisão e de todos os outros valores devidos; e (iii) a Azion fornecerá a mesma assistência de migração pós-rescisão que coloca a disposição dos clientes.\n\n6\\.5. Deixando de vigorar o presente Contrato, todos os serviços serão automaticamente interrompidos de forma definitiva, de modo que o Cliente e seus usuários perderão o acesso.\n\n## 7\\. Remuneração e Reajuste\n\n7\\.1. O Cliente poderá escolher preços e condições de pagamento *On Demand* (“*Preço On Demand*”) ou por Capacidade Reservada (“Preço por Capacidade Reservada”), e pagará à Azion os valores definidos na Ordem de Serviço, sem compensação ou reconvenção, e sem qualquer dedução ou retenção. Para contratar os Produtos e Serviços utilizando o Preço por Capacidade Reservada, o Cliente deverá definir os produtos, serviços, prazo e a quantidade de capacidade reservada desejada na Ordem de Serviço.\n\n7\\.2. O Preço *On Demand* ou Preço por Capacidade Reservada poderão ser corrigidos anualmente pelo IGP-DI/FGV, e poderão ser revistos a qualquer tempo desde que o Cliente seja comunicado com 60 (sessenta) dias de antecedência. Caso isso ocorra, o Cliente poderá: (a) rescindir o Contrato, e receber um reembolso pro rata die pago pelo Preço *On Demand* ou Preço por Capacidade Reservada, notificando a Azion sobre o interesse em rescindir em até 30 (trinta) dias após o recebimento da comunicação mencionada acima, de acordo com a Cláusula 7 do Contrato; ou (b) solicitar a alteração à Azion dos Produtos e Serviços ou sua quantidade contratada na Ordem de Serviço. A menos que a Azion receba um aviso de rescisão por escrito, nos termos da Cláusula 3.2 deste Contrato, o ajuste de preços entrará em vigor conforme notificação e o Contrato ou Ordem de Serviço, posteriormente, só poderão ser cancelados em conformidade com os termos deste Contrato.\n\n7\\.3. Os serviços prestados, para efeito de cobrança, constituem-se em um todo indivisível, de modo que não se admitirão pagamentos parciais. Em razão disso, o pagamento do Preço *On Demand* ou do Preço por Capacidade Reservada deve ser integral. Caso o pagamento não seja integral, o Cliente estará sujeito às consequências do inadimplemento. A Azion poderá cobrar juros a taxa de 1% por mês (ou a maior taxa de juros permitida por lei, caso inferior) sobre todos os valores em atraso, e correção monetária de acordo com o índice IGP-M/FGV até a data do efetivo pagamento.\n\n7\\.4. Mediante o término do prazo da Capacidade Reservada, o Preço por Capacidade Reservada expirará e o Preço On Demand, baseados no uso sob demanda, será aplicável.

Limitação de Responsabilidade\n\n12\\.1. A Azion e suas afiliadas ou licenciantes não serão responsáveis perante o Cliente com relação a qualquer dano direto, indireto, emergente, especial, imprevisto ou multa exemplar (inclusive danos por lucros cessantes, fundo de comércio, uso ou dados), mesmo se uma Parte tiver sido informada sobre a possibilidade de tais danos. Ademais, nem a Azion nem quaisquer de suas afiliadas ou licenciantes serão responsáveis por indenizações, reembolsos ou danos oriundos com relação: (a) a incapacidade do Cliente em utilizar os Produtos e Serviços, inclusive como resultado de qualquer (i) rescisão ou suspensão do presente contrato ou do seu uso ou acesso aos Produtos e Serviços; (ii) o encerramento pela Azion de quaisquer ou de todos os Produtos e Serviços; ou, (iii) sem limitar qualquer obrigação nos termos do Acordo de Nível de Serviço, qualquer tempo inoperante não previsto ou programado de todos ou de uma parcela dos Produtos e Serviços por qualquer motivo, inclusive como resultado de falta de energia elétrica, falhas de sistema ou outras interrupções; (b) aos custos da contratação de bens ou serviços substitutos; (c) aos investimentos, gastos ou compromissos de sua parte no tocante ao presente Contrato ou a seu uso ou acesso aos Produtos e Serviços; ou (d) a qualquer acesso desautorizado, alteração ou eliminação, destruição, dano, perda ou falha no armazenamento do Seu Conteúdo ou outros dados. Em qualquer hipótese, a responsabilidade total da parte da Azion e de suas afiliadas e licenciantes estará limitada ao valor efetivamente pago pelo Cliente nos termos deste Contrato e pelo serviço que ensejou a demanda durante os 12 (doze) meses anteriores à demanda.\n\n## 13\\. Disposições Gerais\n\n13\\.1. A Azion empenhará esforços comercialmente razoáveis para disponibilizar seus serviços de acordo com o Acordo de Nível de Serviço, e informará, com até 10 (dez) dias de antecedência, sobre interrupções necessárias para ajustes técnicos ou manutenção dos Produtos e Serviços. O dever de informação não se aplica a casos de urgência, assim entendidos aqueles que coloquem em risco o regular funcionamento dos Produtos e Serviços ou a segurança da totalidade dos clientes contra vulnerabilidades detectadas.\n\n13\\.2. Para o esclarecimento de possíveis dúvidas em relação à terminologia técnica utilizada na internet e que possa ser relevante para a interpretação do presente Contrato ou Produtos e Serviços, prevalecerão as definições constantes no glossário do presente Contrato, no site da Azion ou no NIST (***National Institute of Standards and Technology, U.S. Department of Commerce***).\n\n13\\.3. O serviço de suporte, caso seja de interesse do Cliente, deverá ser contratado por meio de uma Ordem de Serviço.\n\n13\\.4. Este Contrato representa a totalidade dos entendimentos das partes em relação aos assuntos aqui tratados, substituindo todos os acordos prévios, verbais ou escritos, feitos entre as partes em relação ao objeto das disposições do presente instrumento.\n\n13\\.5. A Ordem de Serviço e o Contrato de Cliente são complementares, no entanto, em caso de divergência entre o Contrato de Cliente e a Ordem de Serviço, prevelecerá o disposto na Ordem de Serviço, bem como no caso de uma Ordem de Serviço suplementar ser acrescentada e as mesmas conflitarem, a Ordem de Serviço mais recente prevalecerá.\n\n13\\.6. A Azion e o Cliente são partes independentes e nenhuma das partes, nem quaisquer respectivas afiliadas, são representantes da outra parte para quaisquer fins ou têm poderes para vincular a outra parte. Ambas as partes se reservam o direito (a) de desenvolver ou fazer com que sejam desenvolvidos para seus produtos, serviços, conceitos, sistemas ou técnicas que sejam similares ou completem os produtos, serviços, conceitos, sistemas ou técnicas desenvolvidas ou contempladas pela outra parte; e (b) de auxiliar desenvolvedores terceiros ou integradores de sistemas, que podem ofertar produtos ou serviços que concorram com os produtos ou serviços da outra parte.\n\n13\\.7. O Cliente não poderá ceder o presente Contrato, nem delegar ou sublicenciar quaisquer de seus direitos aqui estabelecidos, sem o consentimento prévio e por escrito da Azion. Qualquer cessão ou transferência em violação a esta Cláusula será nula. Sujeito ao acima exposto, este Contrato vinculará as partes, sendo revertido em benefício delas e de seus respectivos sucessores e cessionários.\n\n13\\.8. O presente Contrato não cria qualquer direito de beneficiários terceiros sobre qualquer pessoa física ou entidade que não seja parte do presente Contrato.\n\n13\\.9. A Azion e suas afiliadas não se responsabilizarão por qualquer atraso ou descumprimento de qualquer obrigação aqui pactuada, quando o atraso ou descumprimento advir de força maior, além do nosso controle razoável, inclusive casos fortuitos, ações trabalhistas ou outras perturbações industriais, em sistema elétrico, nas telecomunicações, ou outras falhas em serviços públicos, terremotos, tempestades ou outros elementos da natureza, bloqueios, embargos, motins, atos ou ordens governamentais, atos de terrorismos ou guerra.\n\n13\\.10. O não cumprimento por parte da Azion de qualquer disposição do presente Contrato não constituirá uma renúncia atual ou futura de tal disposição, nem limitará o direito da Azion de fazer valer tal disposição posteriormente. Todas as renúncias de nossa parte deverão ser por escrito para terem eficácia.\n\n13\\.11. Se qualquer parte deste Contrato for considerada inválida ou inexequível, as partes remanescentes permanecerão em pleno vigor e efeito. Quaisquer partes inválidas ou inexequíveis serão interpretadas de acordo com o efeito e a intenção da parte original. Se tal interpretação não for possível, a parte inválida ou inexequível será excluída do presente Contrato, mas o restante do Contrato permanecerá em pleno vigor e efeito.\n\n13\\.12. As partes declaram que tiveram ampla liberdade quanto à presente contratação, a qual foi feita em estrita observância aos limites do respectivo fim econômico ou social, pela boa-fé e pelos bons costumes, bem como declaram que não estão em situação de premente necessidade e têm ampla experiência para cumprir todas as cláusulas e condições que constituem seus direitos e obrigações constantes no presente Contrato.\n\n13\\.13. As Partes declaram, sob as penas da Lei, que os signatários do presente Instrumento são seu representantes legais, devidamente constituídos na forma dos respectivos Estatutos/Contratos Sociais, com poderes para assumir as obrigações ora pactuadas, não havendo qualquer limitação ou condicionante que possa comprometer a eficácia deste Contrato.\n\n13\\.14. Sem prejuízo do disposto acima, o Cliente atesta, ainda, que o aceite dos serviços contratados e o pagamento destes servirá, igualmente, como efetiva vinculação aos termos estabelecidos neste Contrato, não podendo esta alegar, em quaisquer hipóteses, a ausência de poderes de seus representantes ou de outras formalidades previstas em seus documentos societários.\n\n13\\.15. No caso de eventuais litígios relativos ao presente Contrato, as partes devem, primeiro, tentar solucionar o conflito por meio de boa-fé e mediação comercial, sem a necessidade de um processo formal. Entretanto, na hipótese de persistência do litígio, as partes elegem o foro de Porto Alegre/RS para a solução de qualquer conflito decorrente do presente Contrato, abdicando de qualquer outro, por mais privilegiado que seja.\n\n## 14\\.

As informações para acesso inicial provisório serão enviadas via e-mail pela Azion. Quando explicitamente permitido, o Cliente poderá criar uma conta principal e múltiplas contas de acesso, mas sempre uma conta por endereço de e-mail. O Cliente é o responsável pela definição da política de utilização da senha de acesso e por todas as atividades que ocorrerem sob sua conta, independentemente de essas atividades terem sido realizadas pelo Cliente, seus empregados, ou um terceiro (inclusive seus contratados ou representantes) e, salvo por violação do presente Contrato, a Azion e suas afiliadas não são responsáveis pelo acesso desautorizado à conta do Cliente. O Cliente comunicará imediatamente a Azion caso acredite que um terceiro desautorizado esteja utilizando sua conta ou caso suas informações de conta forem perdidas ou roubadas.\n\n## 2.

Ainda, assim, caso a Azion seja compelida a despender quaisquer valores em decorrência da demanda, o Cliente reembolsará integralmente a Azion em até 10 (dez) dias úteis contados da data da solicitação.\n\n2.4 O Cliente é responsável pela configuração e utilização adequada dos Produtos e Serviços e pela tomada de precauções para manter a segurança, proteção e backup apropriado do Conteúdo do Cliente, o que poderá incluir o uso de tecnologia de criptografia para proteger o Conteúdo do Cliente do acesso desautorizado e a cópia de segurança rotineira do mesmo.\n\n2.5 As credenciais de login na Azion são apenas para uso próprio, sendo que o Cliente não poderá vendê-las, transferi-las ou sublicenciá-las a qualquer outra entidade ou pessoa, exceto cadastrar uma conta na Azion aos seus representantes e subcontratados que trabalham em nome do Cliente.\n\n2.6 O Cliente será o único responsável pelo uso dos Produtos e Serviços, pelos Usuários Finais e pelo Conteúdo do Cliente, devendo assegurar que todos os Usuários Finais observem suas obrigações nos termos do presente Contrato e que os termos do Contrato com cada Usuário Final sejam condizentes com este Contrato.

Avisos\n\n3.1. A Azion deve fornecer-lhe aviso: (a) postando um aviso no Azion Real Time Manager; ou (b) enviando uma mensagem aos endereços de e-mail então associados a conta do Cliente. Os avisos postados no Site da Azion ou Azion Real Time Manager vigorarão quando da sua publicação online, sendo que os avisos enviados por e-mail vigorarão quando enviarmos o e-mail, independentemente do Cliente tê-lo realmente recebido ou não, sendo responsabilidade do Cliente manter um endereço de e-mail funcional para recebimento dos comunicados.\n\n3.2 Qualquer notificação que o Cliente precisar fazer à Azion, para tudo o que seja decorrente do presente Contrato, se formalizará por escrito e será considerado entregue com a confirmação de recebimento em mãos, por serviço de entrega expressa, carta protocolada ou carta registrada para Azion, para o endereço que consta no início deste Contrato.

O direito da Azion de suspender o acesso ou uso do Cliente ou uso de qualquer Usuário Final é adicional ao direito de rescindir este Contrato nos termos da Cláusula 6.\n\n## 6. Vigência e Rescisão\n\n6.1 O presente Contrato entrará em vigor quando o Cliente clicar no botão ou caixa de seleção “Eu Aceito” apresentado com esses termos ou quando utilizar quaisquer dos Produtos e Serviços Azion pela primeira vez, e permanecerá em vigência até ser rescindido por qualquer das Partes, por qualquer motivo: (i) enviando aviso prévio e (ii) encerrando a conta do Cliente para todos os serviços para os quais a Azion fornece um mecanismo de encerramento de conta online. Este Contrato também poderá ser rescindido por justa causa, à qualquer momento, se houver qualquer inadimplemento ou violação substancial deste Contrato pela outra Parte, e desde que a Parte inadimplente não tenha sanado a falha ou a violação material dentro do prazo de 30 (trinta) dias que lhe será concedido pela Parte prejudicada, mediante aviso prévio a ser enviado quando da identificação da falha ou descumprimento material.\n\n6.2 A Azion também poderá rescindir este Contrato imediatamente, sem necessidade de aviso prévio (a) por justa causa, se qualquer ato ou omissão praticada pelo Cliente ou por qualquer Usuário Final resultar na suspensão descrita na Cláusula 6.1; (b) se o relacionamento da Azion com um terceiro parceiro, que fornece o software ou outra tecnologia que é utilizada pela Azion para fornecer os Produtos e Serviços findar, terminar ou exigir que seja alterada a forma que fornecemos o software ou outra tecnologia; (c) se a Azion acreditar que o fornecimento dos Produtos e Serviços poderá criar um ônus técnico ou econômico ou risco de segurança substancial para a Azion; (d) para observar a lei ou exigências de entidades governamentais; ou (e) se o uso dos Produtos e Serviços pelo Cliente ou qualquer Usuário Final ou ainda se a prestação de quaisquer dos Produtos e Serviços pela Azion ao Cliente ou a qualquer Usuário Final se tornou impraticável ou inviável por qualquer razão legal ou regulamentar.\n\n6.3 Mediante a rescisão deste Contrato: (i) todos os direitos do Cliente aqui pactuados serão extintos imediatamente, exceto conforme previsto na Cláusula 6.4; (ii) o Cliente permanece sendo o responsável por todos os haveres, incluindo todos os valores acordados neste Contrato ou quaisquer documentos anexos a ele, além de excedentes e todas as taxas e despesas incorridas, inclusive despesas incorridas durante o período pós-rescisão; (iii) o Cliente devolverá imediatamente ou, destruirá todo o Conteúdo Azion em sua posse, à critério da Azion; e (iv) as Cláusulas 2.1, 6.3, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 continuarão aplicáveis de acordo com seus termos.\n\n6.4 Após a rescisão, salvo se a Azion encerrar o uso dos Produtos e Serviços do Cliente nos termos da Cláusula 6.1 ou 6.2, (i) a Azion não tomará quaisquer medidas para bloquear o uso ou remover os Conteúdos do Cliente como resultado da rescisão; e (ii) a Azion permitirá que o Cliente recupere o Conteúdo do Cliente dos Produtos e Serviços apenas se tiver pago todos os valores devidos nos termos deste Contrato.\n\n6.5 Para qualquer uso dos Produtos e Serviços após a rescisão, serão aplicados os termos deste Contrato, bem como o Cliente deverá pagar os valores devidos conforme estabelecido na Cláusula 7.\n\n## 7.

O Cliente somente poderá utilizar as marcas Azion de acordo com as diretrizes de uso de marcas registradas.\n\n8.4 Mesmo que o Cliente forneça quaisquer sugestões de melhoria sobre Produtos e Serviços, tais como código fonte, funcionalidade, manuais, dentre outros, todos os direitos de propriedade e da participação sobre as sugestões serão da Azion, mesmo se o Cliente tenha designado que as sugestões são confidenciais. A Azion e suas afiliadas poderão utilizar as sugestões sem restrições. O Cliente neste ato, de forma irrevogável, cede para Azion todos os direitos de propriedade e participação sobre as sugestões, concordando em fornecer à Azion qualquer assistência que esta possa exigir para documentar, aperfeiçoar e manter seus direitos sobre as sugestões.\n\n## 9. Confidencialidade e Publicidade\n\n9.1. As partes acordam que todas as informações trocadas no âmbito deste Contrato devem ser consideradas confidenciais. Caso qualquer das partes seja judicialmente obrigada a divulgar qualquer informação confidencial, a parte obrigada deverá prontamente enviar à outra parte notificação escrita a esse respeito, desde que não esteja sob sigilo judicial, de forma que essa tenha tempo hábil para, quando for o caso, propor a defesa cabível, a medida cautelar ou outro recurso apropriado.\n\n9.2 O Cliente tomará todas as medidas razoáveis para impedir a divulgação, disseminação ou uso não autorizado das Informações Confidenciais da Azion, incluindo, no mínimo, aquelas medidas que tomaria para proteger as suas próprias informações confidenciais de natureza semelhante.\n\n9.3 O compromisso de confidencialidade perdurará por 5 (cinco) anos após o término deste Contrato, devendo ser mantido o sigilo sobre quaisquer dados ou informações obtidas em decorrência deste Contrato.

Se a Azion ou suas afiliadas forem obrigadas a responder à intimação de terceiros ou a outra ordem ou processo judicial, o Cliente também reembolsará a Azion pelos honorários advocatícios gastos, bem como pelo tempo e material gasto pelos empregados e contratados da Azion na resposta da intimação de terceiro ou da ordem ou processo judicial com base na remuneração então vigente por hora.\n\n10.2 A Azion notificará o Cliente prontamente sobre qualquer demanda consoante a Cláusula 10.1. A não notificação imediata por parte da Azion somente afetará as obrigações do Cliente nos termos da Cláusula 10.1, na medida em que a omissão da Azion prejudica a capacidade do Cliente em se defender da demanda. O Cliente poderá: (a) utilizar um advogado de sua escolha (sujeito ao consentimento por escrito da Azion) na defesa de qualquer demanda; e (b) dirimir a demanda conforme considere apropriado, contanto que obtenha o consentimento prévio e por escrito da Azion antes de celebrar qualquer acordo. A Azion também poderá assumir o controle da defesa e da composição da demanda a qualquer tempo.\n\n## 11. Isenção de Responsabilidade\n\n11.1.

Salvo se proibido por lei, a Azion, suas afiliadas e licenciantes se eximem de todas as responsabilidades com relação a garantias, inclusive implícitas de comercialidade, qualidade satisfatória, adequação a um fim específico, não violação ou uso pacífico e quaisquer garantias advindas de qualquer prática comercial ou uso previamente estabelecido.\n\n## 12. Limitação de Responsabilidade\n\n12.1. A Azion e suas afiliadas ou licenciantes não serão responsáveis perante o Cliente com relação a qualquer dano direto, indireto, emergente, especial, imprevisto ou multa exemplar (inclusive danos por lucros cessantes, fundo de comércio, uso ou dados), mesmo se uma Parte tiver sido informada sobre a possibilidade de tais danos. Ademais, nem a Azion nem quaisquer de suas afiliadas ou licenciantes serão responsáveis por indenizações, reembolsos ou danos oriundos com relação: (a) a incapacidade do Cliente em utilizar os Produtos e Serviços, inclusive como resultado de qualquer (i) rescisão ou suspensão do presente contrato ou do seu uso ou acesso aos Produtos e Serviços; (ii) o encerramento pela Azion de quaisquer ou de todos os Produtos e Serviços; ou, (iii) sem limitar qualquer obrigação nos termos do Acordo de Nível de Serviço, qualquer tempo inoperante não previsto ou programado de todos ou de uma parcela dos Produtos e Serviços por qualquer motivo, inclusive como resultado de falta de energia elétrica, falhas de sistema ou outras interrupções; (b) aos custos da contratação de bens ou serviços substitutos; (c) aos investimentos, gastos ou compromissos de sua parte no tocante ao presente Contrato ou a seu uso ou acesso aos Produtos e Serviços; ou (d) a qualquer acesso desautorizado, alteração ou eliminação, destruição, dano, perda ou falha no armazenamento do Conteúdo do Cliente ou outros dados. Em qualquer hipótese, a responsabilidade total da parte da Azion e de suas afiliadas e licenciantes estará limitada ao valor efetivamente pago pelo Cliente nos termos deste Contrato e pelo serviço que ensejou a demanda durante os 12 (doze) meses anteriores à demanda.\n\n## 13. Disposições Gerais\n\n13.1. A Azion empenhará esforços comercialmente razoáveis para disponibilizar seus serviços de acordo com o Acordo de Nível de Serviço, e informará, com até 10 (dez) dias de antecedência, sobre interrupções necessárias para ajustes técnicos ou manutenção dos Produtos e Serviços. O dever de informação não se aplica a casos de urgência, assim entendidos aqueles que coloquem em risco o regular funcionamento dos Produtos e Serviços ou a segurança da totalidade dos clientes contra vulnerabilidades detectadas.\n\n13.2. Para o esclarecimento de possíveis dúvidas em relação à terminologia técnica utilizada na internet e que possa ser relevante para a interpretação do presente Contrato ou Produtos e Serviços, prevalecerão as definições constantes no glossário do presente Contrato, no site da Azion ou no NIST (***National Institute of Standards and Technology, U.S. Department of Commerce\\***).\n\n13.3. Este Contrato representa a totalidade dos entendimentos das partes em relação aos assuntos aqui tratados, substituindo todos os acordos prévios, verbais ou escritos, feitos entre as partes em relação ao objeto das disposições do presente instrumento.\n\n13.4 O Contrato de Cliente e quaisquer documentos anexos a ele são complementares. No entanto, em caso de divergência entre eles, prevalecerá o disposto no documento anexo, bem como no caso de um documento anexo suplementar ser acrescentado e os mesmos conflitarem, o documento anexo mais recente prevalecerá.\n\n13.5 A Azion e o Cliente são partes independentes e nenhuma das partes, nem quaisquer respectivas afiliadas, são representantes da outra parte para quaisquer fins ou têm poderes para vincular a outra parte. Ambas as partes se reservam o direito (a) de desenvolver ou fazer com que sejam desenvolvidos para seus produtos, serviços, conceitos, sistemas ou técnicas que sejam similares ou completem os produtos, serviços, conceitos, sistemas ou técnicas desenvolvidas ou contempladas pela outra parte; e (b) de auxiliar desenvolvedores terceiros ou integradores de sistemas, que podem ofertar Produtos e Serviços que concorram de Produtos e Serviços da outra parte.\n\n13.6 O Cliente não poderá ceder o presente Contrato, nem delegar ou sublicenciar quaisquer de seus direitos aqui estabelecidos, sem o consentimento prévio e por escrito da Azion. Qualquer cessão ou transferência em violação a esta Cláusula será nula. Sujeito ao acima exposto, este Contrato vinculará as partes, sendo revertido em benefício delas e de seus respectivos sucessores e cessionários.\n\n13.7 O presente Contrato não cria qualquer direito de beneficiários terceiros sobre qualquer pessoa física ou entidade que não seja parte do presente Contrato.\n\n13.8 A Azion e suas afiliadas não se responsabilizarão por qualquer atraso ou descumprimento de qualquer obrigação aqui pactuada, quando o atraso ou descumprimento advir de força maior, além do nosso controle razoável, inclusive casos fortuitos, ações trabalhistas ou outras perturbações industriais, em sistema elétrico, nas telecomunicações, ou outras falhas em serviços públicos, terremotos, tempestades ou outros elementos da natureza, bloqueios, embargos, motins, atos ou ordens governamentais, atos de terrorismos ou guerra.\n\n13.9 O não cumprimento por parte da Azion de qualquer disposição do presente Contrato não constituirá uma renúncia atual ou futura de tal disposição, nem limitará o direito da Azion de fazer valer tal disposição posteriormente. Todas as renúncias de nossa parte deverão ser por escrito para terem eficácia.\n\n13.10 Se qualquer parte deste Contrato for considerada inválida ou inexequível, as partes remanescentes permanecerão em pleno vigor e efeito. Quaisquer partes inválidas ou inexequíveis serão interpretadas de acordo com o efeito e a intenção da parte original. Se tal interpretação não for possível, a parte inválida ou inexequível será excluída do presente Contrato, mas o restante do Contrato permanecerá em pleno vigor e efeito.\n\n13.11 As partes declaram que tiveram ampla liberdade quanto à presente contratação, a qual foi feita em estrita observância aos limites do respectivo fim econômico ou social, pela boa-fé e pelos bons costumes, bem como declaram que não estão em situação de premente necessidade e têm ampla experiência para cumprir todas as cláusulas e condições que constituem seus direitos e obrigações constantes no presente Contrato.\n\n13.12 O Cliente atesta que o aceite dos serviços contratados e o pagamento destes servirá, igualmente, como efetiva vinculação aos termos estabelecidos neste Contrato, não podendo esta alegar, em quaisquer hipóteses, a ausência de poderes de seus representantes ou de outras formalidades previstas em seus documentos societários.\n\n13.13 Quaisquer disputas ou reivindicações de qualquer forma relacionadas ao uso dos Produtos e Serviços pelo Cliente, serão resolvidas de forma vinculante por arbitragem, ao invés de cortes e tribunais, exceto se o Cliente puder apresentar suas reivindicações em juizados de pequenas causas, caso suas reivindicações atendam aos requisitos para tal método. Não há nenhum juiz ou júri no procedimento arbitral, e a revisão de uma decisão arbitral por um tribunal é limitada. No entanto, um árbitro pode decidir em caráter individual sobre os mesmos danos e remédios sujeitos às decisões dos tribunais (incluindo sobre medidas cautelares, medidas declaratórias ou danos estatutários), e deve seguir os termos deste Contrato da mesma forma como faria um tribunal. Para iniciar um procedimento arbitral, o Cliente deverá enviar um e-mail solicitando a arbitragem e descrevendo sua reivindicação para nosso departamento jurídico em legal@azion.com. A arbitragem será conduzida pela Câmara de Mediação e Arbitragem do Conselho Regional de Administração do Rio Grande do Sul (CMA-CRA/RS), de acordo com as suas regras que estão disponíveis em www.crars.org.br/cma/. As taxas de abertura do processo, administração e dos árbitros será regido pelas regras da CMA-CRA/RS, e serão pagas pela parte vencida. As Partes concordam que quaisquer procedimentos de resolução de disputas serão conduzidos individualmente, e não por meio de ações coletivas, ações consolidadas ou ações representativas. Se, por qualquer razão, uma reivindicação tiver que ser apresentada em um juiz ou tribunal e não à arbitragem, a Azion e o Cliente concordam em dispensar qualquer direito a julgamento na justiça comum. Observado o disposto na Cláusula 8.4, as partes concordam que poderão apresentar ao tribunal um processo para a determinação de uma infração ou de qualquer utilização indevida de direitos de propriedade intelectual, assim como para a cobrança e execução de valores devidos, previstos em contrato.\n\n13.14 Na hipótese de persistência do litígio, as partes elegem o foro de Porto Alegre/RS, Brasil, para a solução de qualquer conflito decorrente do presente Contrato, abdicando de qualquer outro, por mais privilegiado que seja.\n\n## 14.

    "body": "\n*Última atualização realizada em 25 de Maio de 2016.*\n\nO Cliente terá direito a Crédito de Serviço quando em conformidade com as cláusulas deste Acordo de Nível de Serviço (“SLA”), e mediante sua própria solicitação, seguindo os procedimentos estabelecidos abaixo. Qualquer caso em que Azion não cumpra as Garantias de Nível de Serviço que seguem, será denominado daqui para frente como “Degradação do Serviço”. Não obstante, as Garantias de Nível de Serviço aqui estabelecidas só estarão disponíveis para os clientes cujas contas estejam em boas condições e que não estejam em violação de contratos, termos ou outros documentos, inclusive a Política de Uso Aceitável. Desde já, fica estabelecido que a única e exclusiva reparação para Degradação do Serviço, indisponibilidade, inexecução ou qualquer falha da Azion em fornecer os Serviços, consiste na concessão de Créditos de Serviço ao Cliente, caso elegível, de acordo com os termos deste SLA.\n\n## 1. Garantias de Nível de Serviço\n\nA Azion empenhará esforços comercialmente razoáveis para garantir a Disponibilidade dos Serviços em 100%, conforme as Métricas de Disponibilidade que seguem e os termos de Contrato. O Cliente pode, sob sua despesa, eleger um Serviço de Monitoramento de Disponibilidade terceirizado previamente aprovado pela Azion ou em concordância mútua entre as partes. Se o Serviço de Monitoramento terceirizado detectar uma Degradação do Serviço, conforme definido neste SLA, o Cliente será elegível a receber um Crédito de Serviço e, para isto, deve fornecer dados de monitoramento suficientes, conforme procedimento de Requisição de Créditos de Serviço definido.\n\n### Métricas de Disponibilidade\n\nA Disponibilidade dos Serviços será expressa percentualmente como o somatório total de Entregas Bem Sucedidas, conforme definições que seguem para cada serviço, sobre o total de requisições realizadas dentro do período de faturamento. A Disponibilidade de todos os serviços deverá ser medida a partir de 5 (cinco) locais de regiões geográficas diferentes, em áreas metropolitanas importantes em todo o mundo, nas quais a Azion possui Ponto de Presença (PoP) e através de redes de banda larga.\n\nAzion Content Delivery\n\nA Disponibilidade dos Serviços Content Delivery, Cloud Storage, Load Balancer, Image Optimization, Application Acceleration, Adaptive Delivery, Edge Firewall e Web Application Firewall (WAF) deverá ser calculada seguindo as mesmas regras, com a respectiva funcionalidade corretamente configurada no Azion Real-Time Manager para o Objeto de Teste.\n\nO Serviço de Monitoramento deverá realizar uma operação GET HTTP para o Objeto de Teste previamente armazenado no Azion Cloud Storage, através do correspondente domínio na Azion CDN. O Objeto de Teste deverá ser entregue com cabeçalhos HTTP que permitam cache, TTL (Time-to-Live, tempo que o objeto ficará em cache na CDN) igual ou superior a 2 horas e tamanho entre 1KB e 10KB. A funcionalidade a ser testada deve estar corretamente configurada no Azion Real-Time Manager para o Objeto de Teste. O intervalo entre as requisições será de no mínimo 5 minutos e no máximo 30 minutos. O Serviço de Monitoramento deverá esperar como retorno um código HTTP de sucesso (código de status da classe 2xx) ou “Not Modified” (código de status 304). Será considerada Degradação do Serviço quando 2 tentativas consecutivas de teste falharem em todas as 5 regiões simultaneamente, exceto nas situações previstas na cláusula de Exceções de Cobertura da Garantia de Serviço; caso contrário será contabilizado como Entregas Bem Sucedidas.\n\nAzion Media Packager\n\nO Serviço de Monitoramento deverá realizar uma operação GET HTTP para uma playlist de um Objeto de Teste do tipo áudio, codificado em AAC, com tamanho inferior a 10MB e previamente armazenada no Azion Cloud Storage, em um Bucket com Media Packager configurado, através do correspondente domínio na Azion CDN. O intervalo entre as requisições será de no mínimo 5 minutos e no máximo 30 minutos. O Serviço de Monitoramento deverá esperar como retorno um código HTTP sucesso (código de status da classe 2xx). Será considerada Degradação do Serviço quando 2 tentativas consecutivas de teste falharem em todas as 5 regiões simultaneamente, exceto nas situações previstas na cláusula de Exceções de Cobertura da Garantia de Serviço; caso contrário será contabilizado como Entregas Bem Sucedidas.\n\nAzion Live Ingest\n\nO Serviço de Monitoramento deverá realizar uma operação GET HTTP para uma playlist do Objeto de Teste previamente configurado para entregar um Sinal Live obtido a partir do produto Azion Live Ingest, através do correspondente domínio na Azion CDN. O intervalo entre as requisições será de no mínimo 5 minutos e no máximo 30 minutos. O Serviço de Monitoramento deverá esperar como retorno um código HTTP de sucesso (código de status da classe 2xx). Será considerada Degradação do Serviço quando 2 tentativas consecutivas de teste falharem em todas as 5 regiões simultaneamente, exceto se houver interrupção na origem do sinal e nas situações previstas na cláusula de Exceções de Cobertura da Garantia de Serviço; caso contrário, será contabilizado como Entregas Bem Sucedida.\n\n## 2. Exceções de Cobertura da Garantia de Serviço\n\nNão serão aplicáveis a este SLA, não são elegíveis para Créditos de Serviço e constituem-se como Exceções de Cobertura da Garantia de Serviço, falhas resultantes de: (i) fatores fora do controle da Azion, como desastres naturais, guerras ou atentados terroristas, ações do Governo que impeçam a prestação do(s) Serviço(s), falhas de rede ou acesso a internet ou de dispositivos externos aos POPs da Azion, incluindo falhas com os equipamentos do Cliente ou entre os equipamentos do Cliente e os nossos; (ii) ações controladas pelo Cliente, como por exemplo bloqueio por firewall, desconexão dos Serviços Azion, desativação ou exclusão de configurações ou conteúdos pelo Cliente ou pela Azion quando a pedido desse; (iii) suspensão ou encerramento dos Serviços do Cliente ou do Contrato; (iv) uso inadequado ou discordante da Política de Uso Aceitável dos Serviços; (v) Pico de Tráfego, quando definido em Contratos ou Ordem de Serviço aplicáveis; (vi) uso de versões Beta de sistemas, quando assim identificados pela Azion para o Cliente; (vii) ação não autorizada de qualquer pessoa que tenha acesso à plataforma da Azion por meio das senhas ou equipamentos do Cliente, quando resultante de falhas por parte do Cliente em seguir práticas de segurança adequadas. Além disso, salvo acordo por escrito entre as partes, a Garantia de Nível de Serviço não se aplica durante uma janela de manutenção anunciada pela Azion.\n\n## 3. Crédito de Serviço\n\nO Crédito de Serviço é calculado como um percentual do compromisso mensal de pagamento* do Cliente para o Serviço impactado por uma Degradação de Serviço, de acordo com os percentuais definidos abaixo e sujeito às a qualificações, termos e condições aqui previstas.\n\n| Disponibilidade do Serviço (mensal)      | Percentual de Crédito de Serviço |\n| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |\n| Maior ou igual a 99% e menor do que 100% | 10%                              |\n| Menor do que 99%                         | 25%                              |\n\nO Crédito de Serviço não pode ser transferido ou atribuído a nenhuma outra conta que não a do Cliente em questão e é o único e exclusivo recurso de remediação ou indenização para qualquer falha ou indisponibilidade da Azion em prestar os serviços. O Crédito de Serviço pode ser utilizado ao final do Contrato ou após a renovação do mesmo, para a contratação de qualquer serviço Azion ou sob a forma de desconto, não constituindo qualquer direito a reembolso ou outra forma de pagamento por parte da Azion. Em nenhum momento o Crédito de Serviço será superior ao valor pago ou devido pelo Cliente para o Serviço em questão.\n\n## 4. Processo de Requisição de Crédito de Serviço\n\nO seguinte procedimento deve ser adotado para requisitar Creditos de Serviço:\n\nI. Período para Apresentação: Requisições de Crédito de Serviços devem ser submetidas a Azion no prazo máximo de 7 (sete) dias úteis após a ocorrência da Degradação do Serviço. A omissão em providenciar a comunicação de descumprimento do SLA e fornecer as demais informações exigidas desqualificará o Cliente quanto ao recebimento do Crédito de Serviço.\n\nII. Informações Necessárias: cada Requisição de Crédito de Serviço deve incluir as seguintes informações: (a) nome do Cliente e o nome da configuração impactada; (b) o nome do contato do Cliente e informações para contato; (c) data e hora com fuso horário das ocorrências de Degradação do Serviço com informações sobre as falhas, regiões utilizadas para os testes, URL de teste bem como os códigos de retorno obtidos ou timeouts; (d) os número(s) de ticket abertos com o Suporte Azion específicos sobre o problema com uma breve descrição das características da falha e métrica e; (e) o nome do Serviço de Monitoramento terceirizado utilizado, aprovado pela Azion, além dos logs e telas que demonstrem as falhas.\n\nIII. Processo de Requisição de Crédito de Serviço: o Cliente deve submeter as informações solicitadas por ticket para o Suporte da Azion. A Azion reconhecerá todos os pedidos efetuados dentro do prazo válido após a Degradação do Serviço e irá rever todas as requisições no prazo de 30 (trinta) dias úteis após o recebimento. O Cliente será informado no ticket se o direito ao Crédito de Serviço foi concedido ou rejeitado, de acordo com as definições deste SLA. Se foi rejeitado, a notificação especificará os fundamentos para a rejeição.\n\nA Azion avaliará todas as informações razoavelmente disponibilizadas e fará uma determinação de boa-fé para avaliar se é devido o Crédito de Serviço.\n\n\\* Para clientes com contratos baseados em uso (i.e. On Demand, sem Reserva de Capacidade), o Crédito de Serviço será calculado como o percentual do valor agregado mensal pago pelo cliente para o Serviço impactado pela Degradação do Serviço, no mês em que a Degradação do Serviço se aplicar.\n\nVersão registrada do contrato:\n[Contrato de Cliente – 25 de Maio de 2016.](/assets/docs/images/contratos/sla/Acordo-de-Nivel-de-Servico-Azion-25-de-Maio-2016.pdf)\n",

    "body": "\n*Última atualização realizada em 10 de novembro de 2016.*\n\nAs seguintes definições referentes aos produtos e serviços, metodologias de cobrança e demais termos são aplicáveis à contratação e uso dos produtos e serviços Azion. Buscamos aprimorar constantemente as nossas soluções e, em decorrência disso, este documento pode sofrer atualizações, devendo sempre ser consultado em sua última versão.\n\nTodos os produtos e serviços da Azion são oferecidos como *Cloud Services* e são acessíveis por meio dos protocolos de comunicação específicos da Internet. Nossos servidores de entrega, aceleração e proteção de conteúdos e aplicações web (Edge Servers) estão localizados em diversos pontos de presença (POPs) espalhados pelo mundo. A orquestração e configuração dos produtos e serviços Azion é feita pela interface do Real-Time Manager ou suas APIs e ocorre em tempo real. Os produtos e serviços são tarifados de acordo com o uso, modalidade de contratação e preços conforme definidos na Ordem de Serviço ou Site da Azion.\n\n## Produtos e Serviços\n\nContent Delivery: serviço de entrega de conteúdos web de qualquer formato e tipo, inclusive HTTP Live Streaming (HLS), por meio dos protocolos HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1 e HTTP/2 e dos métodos HTTP GET, HEAD e OPTIONS. Inclui acesso a (1) rede da Azion para entrega de conteúdo; (2) funcionalidade de cache de conteúdos; (3) manipulação de cabeçalhos HTTP; (4) criação de regras para redirecionamento, bloqueio de acesso ou entrega do conteúdo; (5) Analytics com indicadores básicos do serviço; (6) ferramenta de Real-Time Purge com suporte a Wildcard; (7) entrega de conteúdo em cache enquanto a origem estiver inacessível (*stale while revalidate*); (8) entrega de conteúdo HTTPS (TLS) com suporte a OCSP Stapling; (9) upload de certificado TLS/SNI, caso suportado pelo browser do usuário, ou uso do certificado compartilhado da Azion, e (10) integração com todos os produtos e serviços da Azion. Para utilizar este serviço, é necessário que o Cliente armazene a versão original de Seu Conteúdo em um servidor web de origem, que pode ser o Cloud Storage da Azion ou qualquer servidor com acesso HTTP. Para garantir o bom funcionamento dos serviços, a Azion poderá habilitar, desabilitar ou modificar serviços, POPs, endereços IPs, servidores ou qualquer equipamento, sem aviso prévio, sempre visando a manutenção da performance e disponibilidade dos mesmos. NÃO EXISTE UMA GARANTIA DE QUE O CONTEÚDO (OBJETO) ESTARÁ DISPONÍVEL EM CACHE DURANTE TODA DURAÇÃO DO TIME-TO-LIVE (TTL) CONFIGURADO PELO CLIENTE. A AZION FAZ OS INVESTIMENTOS NECESSÁRIOS PARA MANTER OS DADOS EM CACHE PELO TEMPO MAIS PRÓXIMO DO QUE FOR CONFIGURADO PELOS CLIENTES, PORÉM OS OBJETOS MENOS ACESSADOS PODEM SER AUTOMATICAMENTE REMOVIDOS DO CACHE PARA CEDER ESPAÇO PARA OBJETOS DE MAIOR VOLUME DE ACESSOS ATRAVÉS DE UM ALGORITMO DE LRU (LEAST RECENTLY USED). O TAMANHO MÁXIMO DE OBJETO É DE 10GB E, PARA UTILIZAR O SERVIÇO COM OBJETOS MAIORES É NECESSÁRIO AUTORIZAÇÃO DA AZION POR ESCRITO.\n\nApplication Acceleration: serviço de aceleração de aplicações web e APIs. Inclui acesso a funcionalidades de otimização de protocolos, regras avançadas de cache (Advanced Cache Key) que permite o cache granular, segmentação e políticas de cache com base em critérios como name/value de Cookies e Query Strings, além de funcionalidades como Bypass Cache, KeepAlive e Forward Cookies. Disponibiliza os métodos HTTP GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE e OPTIONS.\n\nAdaptive Delivery: provê um serviço de detecção de dispositivos baseado na User Agent String enviada pelo Usuário, permitindo a entrega de conteúdos para diferentes dispositivos e formatos a partir da mesma URL. A eficiência do produto depende da correta configuração das expressões regulares que viabilizam o mapeamento dos tipos de dispositivos e correspondentes User Agent Strings. É responsabilidade do Cliente a manutenção e atualização da lista de grupos de dispositivos, que pode contar com as listas pré-definidas pela Azion. Cabe ao servidor de origem do Cliente a entrega do conteúdo mais adequado para cada tipo de dispositivo, de acordo com a detecção realizada pelo Adaptive Delivery e informada ao servidor de origem por meio de um campo de cabeçalho HTTP X-UA-Device. As variações de conteúdo poderão ser cacheadas nos Edge Servers da Azion, de acordo com as configurações definidas.\n\nLoad Balancer: serviço projetado para balancear o tráfego HTTP/HTTPS do cliente entre origens distribuídas em múltiplos datacenters, provedores de serviço (multi-cloud) ou em um mesmo datacenter, eliminando ou minimizando a necessidade de hardware ou software dedicadas e reduzindo o impacto de falhas locais na disponibilidade global do conteúdo. Inclui acesso as funcionalidades de (1) balanceamento Round-Robin, Least Connections e IP Hash; (2) atribuição de diferentes pesos às origens; (3) configuração de servidores Primary ou Backup (*standby*); (4) manipulação de erros e exceções em caso de *timeout* para conectar ou receber uma resposta da origem, ou em caso da resposta HTTP da origem ser um erro 404 (*Not Found*) ou 5xx.\n\nAnalytics: serviço de monitoramento de indicadores dos produtos e serviços Azion. Provê uma interface web para análise de gráficos e indicadores coletados de acordo com as configurações dos Clientes. Possui uma versão Standard, incluída no serviço Content Delivery, que disponibiliza os principais indicadores de monitoramento, como *Data Transferred, Bandwidth e Requests,* além de indicadores específicos para os diversos produtos e serviços Azion contratados como WAF, Live Ingest, Cloud Storage, Image Optimization e Media Packager, com filtragem por período e retenção dos dados por 12 meses. Possui também uma versão Premium, que disponibiliza filtros para segmentação dos dados por configuração do Cliente, retenção dos dados por 24 meses, exportação dos dados para CSV, além de indicadores mais avançados, como *Status Codes, HTTP Methods,* dentre outros.\n\nEdge Firewall: permite a criação de regras de controle de acesso ao conteúdo e aplicações diretamente nos Edge Servers da Azion. O controle de acesso pode ser realizado por endereço IP ou rede, geolocalização (país de acesso), HTTP Referer, Secure Token e Rate Limit. A Azion utiliza bases de dados de fornecedores externos para identificação de geolocalização baseada no endereço IP do Usuário, as quais podem ser imprecisas em algumas situações, cabendo ao Cliente a responsabilidade pelo uso dessa funcionalidade de restrição de acesso. O bloqueio por HTTP Referer se baseia em informações fornecidas pelo Browser ou aplicação que requisita o conteúdo, podendo ter sofrido manipulação maliciosa por parte do Usuário para obter acesso indevido, cabendo, portanto, ao Cliente a responsabilidade por esse tipo de controle de acesso. Rate Limit é calculado individualmente para cada Edge Server da Azion, não constituindo, portanto, um limite global de acesso ao conteúdo. Secure Token representa um mecanismo de validação de acesso baseado em Hash MD5, cabendo ao Cliente a segurança da Secret utilizada para geração do Hash e estando o Cliente ciente de que o algoritmo MD5 pode ser afetado por colisões para obtenção de acesso indevido ao conteúdo. A AZION PROVÊ MECANISMOS DE CONTROLE DE ACESSO BASEADOS NO MELHOR ESFORÇO, MAS QUE NÃO CONSTITUEM RESTRIÇÕES INTRANSPONÍVEIS CONTRA ACESSOS NÃO AUTORIZADOS. O CLIENTE DEVE REALIZAR A RESTRIÇÃO DE ACESSO POR ENDEREÇO IP PARA OBTER O MELHOR NÍVEL DE CONTROLE E A AZION RECOMENDA A COMBINAÇÃO DE MÚLTIPLAS TÉCNICAS.\n\nWeb Application Firewall (WAF): provê uma camada de proteção para aplicações web, com funcionalidades como: (1) controle para mitigar ameaças como SQL Injections, Cross-Site Scripting, RFI, entre outros; (2) criação de Rule Sets configuráveis para seleção dos mecanismos de proteção desejados e sensibilidade das regras; (3) criação de Whitelists customizadas de acordo com o comportamento da aplicação; (4) opção de Counting Mode para análise de ameaças sem o efetivo bloqueio das mesmas; (5) gráficos em tempo real contendo informações sobre ameaças detectadas e ataques bloqueados. Recomendamos habilitar a funcionalidade de Counting Mode assistido pelo Suporte da Azion para etapa de aprendizado dos comportamentos da aplicação, para melhorar a eficiência do serviço e reduzir o risco de identificação de falsos positivos e bloqueio de requisições legítimas. Ainda assim, advertimos de que pode haver o bloqueio de requisições legítimas à aplicação, caso coincidam com alguma das regras de segurança do WAF. A AZION ESTÁ CONSTANTEMENTE BUSCANDO ATUALIZAÇÃO DE SEUS MECANISMOS DE SEGURANÇA PARA AUMENTAR A EFETIVIDADE DOS SISTEMAS DE PROTEÇÃO E REDUZIR O RISCO DE ATAQUES ÀS APLICAÇÕES DO CLIENTE, NO ENTANTO, NÃO HÁ UMA GARANTIA DE QUE O SERVIÇO WAF SERÁ CAPAZ DE PREVENIR TODAS AS POSSIBILIDADES DE ATAQUES OU AMEAÇAS. RECOMENDAMOS QUE OS CLIENTES MANTENHAM OS CONTROLES DE SEGURANÇA TAMBÉM EM SUAS ORIGENS. O CLIENTE ASSUME TODO O RISCO DE CAUSAR INDISPONIBILIDADE DE SERVIÇO DEVIDO A REGRAS MAL CONFIGURADAS. O ACORDO DE NÍVEL DE SERVIÇO (SLA) NÃO SE APLICA QUANDO REGRAS PERSONALIZADAS SÃO CRIADAS PELO CLIENTE.\n\nImage Optimization: é o serviço de otimização e a manipulação dinâmica de imagens. As funcionalidades suportadas são: (1) otimização; (2) corte; (3) redimensionamento; (4) conversão de formato e (5) aplicações de filtros como blur, noise, marca d’água, dentre outros. Os formatos suportados são JPEG, GIF e PNG. A manipulação das imagens é realizada através de parâmetros de Query String enviados na requisição. A otimização da imagem consiste no processo de reduzir o tamanho do arquivo de imagem, quando possível, buscando minimizar as perdas de qualidade perceptíveis da imagem, decorrentes do processo de otimização. O serviço pode entregar a imagem em um formato de arquivo distinto do original, de acordo com o Browser de acesso do Usuário, buscando uma melhor otimização da entrega. Não há uma garantia de ganho no processo de otimização cabendo ao cliente monitorar o ganho médio decorrente do uso do serviço. O CLIENTE DEVE ESTAR CIENTE DE QUE O PROCESSO DE OTIMIZAÇÃO DE IMAGENS ALTERA O CONTEÚDO ENTREGUE PARA O USUÁRIO FINAL, PODENDO RESULTAR EM DIFERENÇAS NA QUALIDADE VISUAL DA IMAGEM. A AZION PODERÁ, A QUALQUER MOMENTO E SEM AVISO PRÉVIO, ATUALIZAR OS ALGORITMOS DE OTIMIZAÇÃO, RESULTANDO EM DIFERENÇAS NO CONTEÚDO ENTREGUE E NA EFICIÊNCIA DA OTIMIZAÇÃO.\n\nCloud Storage: oferece armazenamento baseado em nuvem com alta disponibilidade, replicação multi-datacenter, segurança e durabilidade dos dados. Pode ser utilizado como servidor de origem para o Content Delivery e é integrado a outros serviços, como Media Packager, Media Encoder e Log Streaming. A transferência dos arquivos para o Cloud Storage pode ser realizada utilizando-se os protocolos FTP ou RSYNC e, em caráter Beta, SFTP e SCP.\n\nLive Ingest: é o serviço oferecido para ingestão de Live Streaming para posterior distribuição através do Content Delivery. A ingestão da transmissão Live deve ser realizada utilizando-se o protocolo RTMP, autenticada através de usuário e senha e utilizando um *encoder* homologado pela Azion. Para melhorar a disponibilidade da transmissão, recomenda-se a configuração de dois RTMP Endpoints, um Primary e um Backup, em regiões geográficas distintas. O serviço provê a funcionalidade de Dynamic Packaging, para converter o formato de entrega para HLS, para que possa ser distribuído pelo Content Delivery em HTTP. O *encoder* do Cliente deve respeitar as recomendações de configuração, formatos e codecs suportados pelo serviço e homologados pela Azion.\n\nMedia Encoder: provê o serviço de *transcoding*, ou troca de codec, de mídias (áudio e vídeo) do Cliente. Os arquivos de mídia devem ser armazenados no Cloud Storage para posterior *transcoding*, de acordo com o perfil de codificação desejado pelo Cliente. Assim que processada a requisição, os novos arquivos com o perfil de codificação selecionado são armazenados em um bucket do Cloud Storage, para posterior uso pelo Cliente. As requisições devem ser encaminhadas por ticket pelo Cliente para a equipe de Customer Services.\n\nMedia Packager: serviço que provê troca dinâmica de formato de arquivos de mídias (áudio e vídeo) para distribuição de VoD através do Content Delivery, em HTTP. Os formatos de mídia suportados são FLV (Flash Video), MP4 (QuickTime – .mp4, .f4v, .mov, .m4v, .mp4a, .3gp, .3g2), .ismv, .isma e MP3 (.mp3). O formato de entrega é HTTP Live Streaming (HLS). Os arquivos de mídia devem ser armazenados em um bucket do Cloud Storage com Media Packager habilitado ou em um servidor web externo, desde que previamente homologado pela Azion. Outros formatos de entrega, como HDS, Smooth Streaming e MPEG-DASH, poderão ser disponibilizados para os Clientes, a critério da Azion, em caráter Beta.\n\nDigital Certificates: é o serviço de intermediação e manutenção da emissão de certificados SSL compartilhados, do tipo Domain Validated (DV), junto a uma Autoridade Certificadora (CA) de escolha da Azion, para uso único e exclusivo no serviço Content Delivery. O Cliente deve estar apto a comprovar a autoridade pelos domínios desejados, seguindo os procedimentos técnicos solicitados pela CA. O certificado SSL e chave privada são compartilhados entre múltiplos Clientes e serão de posse exclusiva da Azion. O certificado e ou chave privada não será, sob hipótese alguma, enviado ao Cliente.\n\nDDoS Protection: ataques DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) é um tipo de ataque no qual inúmeros sistemas comprometidos externos são utilizados para sobrecarregar um sistema alvo resultando em negação de serviço. A Azion provê uma moderna abordagem de filtragem de ataques do tipo DDoS através de seu Mitigation Center, reduzindo o impacto do ataque pela absorção e filtragem do pico de tráfego malicioso e reduzindo o risco de tarifação de excedente pelo tráfego indesejado. O serviço é gerenciado pela equipe de profissionais da Azion e não requer configurações por parte do Cliente. O CLIENTE DEVE ESTAR CIENTE DE QUE O SERVIÇO NÃO ELIMINA OU PREVINE TODOS OS TIPOS DE ATAQUE DDOS E DEVE ENTRAR EM CONTATO COM O SUPORTE DA AZION CASO ALGUM ATAQUE DDOS NÃO SEJA DETECTADO E PREVENIDO PARA QUE OUTRAS AÇÕES DE MITIGAÇÃO POSSAM SER EXECUTADAS. O CLIENTE CONCORDA COM A FILTRAGEM DO TRÁFEGO DURANTE ATAQUES DE DDOS, O QUE PODE EVENTUALMENTE OCASIONAR FILTRAGEM DE TRÁFEGO LEGÍTIMO OU NÃO MALICIOSO.\n\nSupport: o serviço de Suporte da Azion é recomendado para clientes que precisam de ajuda para operar os produtos Azion e está disponível nas modalidades Developer, Enterprise ou Mission Critical. As modalidades Enterprise e Mission Critical dispõem de canais para atendimento a incidentes 24x7x365 e, em horário comercial, para esclarecimento de dúvidas referentes aos produtos Azion. O Tempo de Resposta (SLA) é definido de acordo com a modalidade contratada e prioridade do ticket: (i) Mission Critical: 20 min ou menos para tickets com prioridade Production Down, 1h para High, 6h para Normal e 12h para Low; (ii) Enterprise: 1h ou menos para tickets com prioridade High, 6h para Normal e 12h para Low; (iii) Developer: 6h úteis ou menos para tickets com prioridade Normal e 12h úteis para Low.\n\n## Modalidade de Contratação e Cobrança\n\nContratação *On Demand*: modalidade de contratação na qual o Cliente paga conforme a utilização dos Produtos e Serviços Azion. O valor a ser pago pelo Cliente para cada Serviço utilizado corresponde à multiplicação do montante apurado pela Azion para a Métrica de Contabilização do Serviço no período de faturamento e o seu respectivo Valor Unitário, discriminado na Ordem de Serviço ou no Site da Azion. Quando especificadas Faixas de Consumo Mensal na Ordem de Serviço, Valores Unitários reduzidos serão aplicados para a parcela de consumo que exceder a faixa imediatamente superior, respeitando-se os Valores Unitários e as respectivas Faixas de Consumo definidas na Ordem de Serviço.\n\nContratação Reserva de Capacidade: modalidade de contratação na qual o Cliente se compromete com o consumo mensal reservado, especificado na Ordem de Serviço. O pagamento ocorre antecipadamente no valor correspondente a capacidade reservada para o Cliente. Em havendo excedente de uso da capacidade reservada no período de faturamento e de acordo com a apuração realizada pela Azion para a Métrica de Contabilização, será cobrado o consumo excedente do Cliente, multiplicando-se a parcela que exceder a capacidade reservada pelo respectivo Valor Unitário por Excedente, discriminado na Ordem de Serviço. O volume não utilizado em um mês, se houver, não poderá ser utilizado nos meses seguintes.\n\n## Métricas e Metodologias de Contabilização de Uso dos Produtos\n\nData Transferred (total): refere-se ao volume total de GB trafegados através dos Edge Servers da Azion, para todas as configurações do Cliente, independente os serviços habilitados em cada configuração. Corresponde a soma do tráfego entregue para os usuários que requisitam o conteúdo ou aplicação e o tráfego para buscar o conteúdo nos servidores de origem, mesmo quando se tratar de servidores de origem internos da rede Azion, como no caso dos serviços Cloud Storage, Image Optimization, Live Ingest e Media Packager. Essa métrica representa o total de tráfego que entra (*ingress*) e que sai (*egress*) da rede de Edge Servers da Azion e representa a métrica de tarifação básica para os serviços Content Delivery e DDoS Protection. A métrica Data Transferred (total) é compartilhada (*shared*) entre todos os produtos que utilizam os Edge Servers da Azion.\n\nData Transferred: refere-se ao volume total de GB trafegados através dos Edge Servers da Azion, para as configurações de Content Delivery do Cliente que estejam com algum serviço específico ativado, como no caso dos Serviços Application Acceleration, Adaptive Delivery ou Load Balancer, geralmente expresso entre parênteses ao lado do nome desta métrica ou, por omissão, quando do contexto da explicação do Serviço. Corresponde a soma do tráfego entregue para os usuários que requisitam o conteúdo ou aplicação e o tráfego para buscar o mesmo nos servidores de origem, para as configurações com o Serviço habilitado. A métrica Data Transferred é computada individualmente para cada Serviço e, caso uma configuração do Cliente possua mais de um serviço ativado simultaneamente, o tráfego através dessa configuração irá incrementar as métricas Data Transferred de todos os serviços que estiverem ativados, além de incrementar simultaneamente o Data Transferred (total).\n\nRequests: refere-se à soma total de requisições HTTP e de requisições HTTPS dos usuários para os Edge Servers da Azion, quando processadas, analisadas ou armazenadas por algum serviço Azion específico, como Analytics Premium, Log Streaming, Edge Firewall ou Web Application Firewall. A métrica Requests é computada individualmente para cada serviço e, caso uma mesma requisição HTTP ou HTTPS seja analisada, processada ou armazenada simultaneamente por mais de um serviço Azion, irá incrementar a métrica Requests de todos os serviços envolvidos no processamento da requisição. A contabilização de Requests ocorre em blocos de um milhão e os valores fracionários, quando houver, serão arredondados para cima.\n\nImages Processed: volume total de imagens processadas pelo serviço Image Optimization, quer para otimização, corte, redimensionamento, aplicação de filtro e demais funcionalidades do serviço. A contabilização de Imagens processadas ocorre a cada requisição dos Edge Servers Azion para o serviço de Image Optimization. A contabilização de Images Processed ocorre em blocos de um milhão e os valores fracionários, quando houver, serão arredondados para cima.\n\nUsed Space: pico de utilização de espaço em GB no produto Cloud Storage, durante o período de faturamento, para armazenamento de arquivos do Cliente, logs do serviço Log Streaming ou mídias resultantes do processo de encoding do serviço Media Encoder.\n\nData Ingested: refere-se ao volume total de GB transferidos pelo Cliente para o serviço Live Ingest, processo denominado de *ingesting*, para posterior distribuição aos Edges Servers da Azion.\n\nData Encoded: refere-se ao volume total de GB codificados pelo serviço Media Encoder, no período de faturamento. A codificação da mídia segue a especificação de um perfil definido pelo Cliente. Caso a codificação resulte em múltiplas mídias, o Volume de dados (Data Encoded) é representado pela soma total do tamanho das mídia codificadas, no processo denominado de *encoding*.\n\nData Packaged: refere-se ao volume total de GB trafegados através do produto Media Packager. Corresponde a soma do volume de dados enviados pelo Media Packager aos Edge Servers Azion, no processo denominado de *transmuxing* ou *dynamic packaging, com o volume de dados recebidos pelo Media Packager dos servidores de origem, caso as mídias estejam armazenadas em local diferente do Azion Cloud Storage. O troca de tráfego entre o produto Cloud Storage e o produto Media Packager não é tarifada.*\n\n*Wildcard domains: refere-se a quantidade de domínios \\*wildcard\\* para fins de emissão de certificados SSL compartilhados.Unidades UtilizadasA Azion respeita a convenção ISO/IEC 80000 e, portanto, a conversão dos fatores de unidades de tráfego é sempre realizada por 1.000.TB: terabyte(s), 1 TB = 1.000 GB.\nGB: gigabyte(s), 1 GB = 1.000 MB.\nMB: megabyte(s), 1 MB = 1.000 KB.\nKB ou kB: kilobyte(s), 1KB = 1.000 bytes.*\n",

    "body": "\n*Última atualização realizada em 15 de Maio de 2019.*\n\nAs seguintes definições referentes aos produtos e serviços, metodologias de cobrança e demais termos são aplicáveis à contratação e uso dos Produtos e Serviços Azion. Buscamos aprimorar constantemente as nossas soluções e, em decorrência disso, este documento pode sofrer atualizações, devendo sempre ser consultado em sua última versão.\n\nTodos os produtos e serviços da Azion são oferecidos como Cloud Services e são acessíveis por meio de protocolos de comunicação específicos da Internet. Nossos servidores estão localizados em diversos pontos de presença (POPs) espalhados pelo mundo. A orquestração e configuração dos Produtos e Serviços Azion é feita pela interface do Real-Time Manager ou suas APIs. Os produtos e serviços são tarifados de acordo com o uso, modalidade de contratação e preços conforme definido no Contrato de Cliente.\n\n## 1. Produtos e Serviços\n\nAdaptive Delivery: módulo do Edge Applications projetado para fazer a detecção de dispositivos baseado na User Agent String enviada pelo Usuário, permitindo a entrega de conteúdos para diferentes dispositivos e formatos a partir da mesma URL. A eficiência do produto depende da correta configuração das expressões regulares que viabilizam o mapeamento dos tipos de dispositivos e correspondentes User Agent Strings. É responsabilidade do Cliente a manutenção e atualização da lista de grupos de dispositivos, que pode contar com as listas pré-definidas pela Azion. Cabe ao servidor de origem do Cliente a entrega do conteúdo mais adequado para cada tipo de dispositivo, de acordo com a detecção realizada pelo Adaptive Delivery e informada ao servidor de origem por meio de um campo de cabeçalho HTTP customizável. As variações de conteúdo poderão ser cacheadas nos Edge Servers da Azion, de acordo com as configurações definidas. Salvo disposição em contrário no Contrato de Cliente ou quaisquer documentos anexos a ele, a cobrança do Adaptive Delivery se dará pelo Data Transferred de acordo com os volumes consumidos.\n\nApplication Acceleration: módulo do Edge Applications projetado para acelerar aplicações web e APIs.

O formato de entrega suportado pelo Media Packager é HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) e os arquivos de mídia devem ser armazenados em um bucket do Cloud Storage com Media Packager habilitado. A transferência dos arquivos para o Cloud Storage pode ser realizada utilizando-se o protocolo S3. A AZION NÃO REALIZA BACKUP DOS DADOS ARMAZENADOS NO CLOUD STORAGE E RECOMENDA QUE O CLIENTE MANTENHA UMA CÓPIA DE SEGURANÇA DE SEUS DADOS EM OUTRO LOCAL. Salvo disposição em contrário no Contrato de Cliente ou quaisquer documentos anexos a ele, a cobrança do Cloud Storage se dará pelo (a) Used Space; (b) Requests; (c) Data Transferred; e (d) Data Packaged, de acordo com os volumes consumidos.\n\nData Streaming: módulo do Data Stack projetado para realizar a coleta de dados das requisições à Edge Applications ou outros Produtos e Serviços Azion. As informações que devem ser coletadas são selecionadas pelo cliente, que desde já se declara autorizado por seus usuários a coletar e processar informações recebidas nas requisições. A AZION NÃO SE RESPONSABILIZA PELO: (A) USO QUE SERÁ DADO PELO CLIENTE AOS DADOS COLETADOS; (B) DIREITO QUE O CLIENTE TEM DE COLETAR DADOS DE SEUS USUÁRIOS. As informações coletadas são enviadas para a infraestrutura do cliente utilizando o protocolo escolhido pelo Cliente na interface do Real-Time Manager ou API, no formato JSON, definido em um template configurável. O envio dos dados é realizado em blocos de 2 mil requisições, separados por \\n, ou 60 segundos, o que ocorrer antes. A Azion fará todos os esforços comercialmente razoáveis para enviar os dados para a infraestrutura do cliente, ou de seus fornecedores, em tempo real ou com atraso inferior a 3 minutos, no entanto, em casos de picos de acesso, ataques ou causas externas a Azion, o atraso pode superar o previsto. O CLIENTE É RESPONSÁVEL PELA DISPONIBILIDADE DE SUA INFRAESTRUTURA DE RECEBIMENTO DOS DADOS E, EM CASO DE INDISPONIBILIDADE DA MESMA, A AZION PODERÁ DESCARTAR OS DADOS COLETADOS. Salvo disposição em contrário no Contrato de Cliente ou quaisquer documentos anexos a ele, a cobrança do Data Streaming se dará por (a) Data Streaming Requests e (b) Data Streamed, de acordo com os volumes consumidos.\n\nDDoS Protection: O DDoS Protection será prestado única e exclusivamente de acordo com os termos disponíveis em [DDoS Protection](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-firewall/ddos-protection/) (“Diretrizes”). Ao utilizar a Azion o Cliente (i) autoriza a Azion a impor as medidas técnicas disponíveis na plataforma Azion para controlar ou mitigar um ataque DDoS, mesmo que tais medidas resultem na degradação da performance na entrega do conteúdo ou aplicações, e (ii) reconhece que o Acordo de Nível de Serviço (\"SLA\") não se aplica durante o período de um ataque DDoS. O serviço Azion DDoS Protection é oferecido nas modalidades: Standard DDoS Protection: O Standard DDoS Protection inclui as funcionalidades: (a) análise do fluxo de rede (layers 3 e 4); (b) detecção de ataques de DDoS mais comuns, das camadas de rede e transporte e (c) mitigação de ataques de DDoS mais comuns, das camadas de rede e transporte, até o limite de 5 Gbps. Managed DDoS Protection: inclui todas as funcionalidades do Standard DDoS Protection e mais: (a) detecção de ataques de DDoS mais sofisticados; (b) proteção de custo por meio de crédito de serviço, quando aplicável; (c) mitigação de ataques de DDoS de maior volume, com três opções de contratação de limites de proteção: (i) Managed DDoS Protection 20 Gbps, para proteção contra ataques DDoS de até 20 Gbps; (ii) Managed DDoS Protection 50 Gbps, para proteção contra ataques DDoS de até 50 Gbps; (iii) Managed DDoS Protection Unlimited, para proteção contra ataques DDoS sem limite de volume, podendo utilizar toda a rede da Azion para mitigação, além de acesso 24x7 ao Security Response Team (SRT) mediante contratação do Support Mission Critical. Ataques que superam os volumes contratados poderão ser imediatamente bloqueados até que o ataque se encerre. Para ser elegível para um crédito de serviço (a) o ataque DDoS deve resultar em uma cobrança que exceda o dobro da média mensal de consumo dos seis (6) meses anteriores, excluindo-se meses em que ocorreu um ataque DDoS; (b) na impossibilidade de apurar a média mensal de consumo dos seis meses anteriores, serão utilizados como base a média do volume de consumo dos meses disponíveis; (c) o Cliente deve notificar o Suporte Técnico da Azion de um ataque DDoS em andamento por meio do registro de um ticket online; (d) O Suporte Técnico da Azion deve verificar que o ataque DDoS reportado é um ataque DDoS legítimo; e (e) os pedidos de crédito devem ser enviados pelo Cliente até 30 dias após o fechamento da fatura de serviço em disputa. Salvo disposição em contrário no Contrato de Cliente ou quaisquer documentos anexos a ele, a cobrança do Managed DDoS Protection se dará por (a) um valor mensal fixo de acordo com o limite de proteção contratada (Protection Fee) e, adicionalmente, (b) um valor por GB de tráfego total (Total Data Transferred). Ao contratar o serviço Managed DDoS Protection, o Cliente fica obrigado a pagar por um mínimo de doze (12) meses do serviço. Se a fatura média do Cliente exceder o seu volume contratado, ou se mais de dois créditos forem solicitados em um determinado ano calendário, a Azion terá o direito de exigir que o Cliente pague um DDoS Protection Fee adicional para cada ataque DDoS sofrido. Um único crédito poderá ser aplicado mensalmente, mesmo quando vários ataques ocorrerem no mês. O crédito deve ser emitido como nota de crédito e não uma nota fiscal revisada. A AZION ESTÁ CONSTANTEMENTE BUSCANDO ATUALIZAÇÃO DE SEUS MECANISMOS DE SEGURANÇA PARA AUMENTAR A EFETIVIDADE DOS SISTEMAS DE PROTEÇÃO E REDUZIR O RISCO DE IMPACTO ÀS APLICAÇÕES DO CLIENTE. NO ENTANTO, NÃO HÁ UMA GARANTIA DE QUE O SERVIÇO DDOS SERÁ CAPAZ DE PREVENIR TODAS AS POSSIBILIDADES DE ATAQUES OU AMEAÇAS. RECOMENDAMOS QUE OS CLIENTES MANTENHAM OS CONTROLES DE SEGURANÇA TAMBÉM EM SUAS ORIGENS. O CLIENTE ASSUME TODO O RISCO DE INDISPONIBILIDADE DE SERVIÇO DEVIDO A REGRAS MAL CONFIGURADAS NO SERVIÇO.\n\nDigital Certificates: é o serviço de intermediação e manutenção da emissão de certificados SSL compartilhados, do tipo Domain Validated (DV), junto a uma Autoridade Certificadora (CA) de escolha da Azion, para uso único e exclusivo em Edge Applications. O Cliente deve estar apto a comprovar a autoridade pelos domínios desejados, seguindo os procedimentos técnicos solicitados pela CA. O certificado SSL e chave privada são compartilhados entre múltiplos Clientes e serão de posse exclusiva da Azion. O certificado e ou chave privada não será, sob hipótese alguma, enviado ao Cliente. Salvo disposição em contrário no Contrato de Cliente ou quaisquer documentos anexos a ele, a cobrança do Digital Certificates se dará pelo número de Digital Certificates de acordo com os volumes consumidos.\n\nEdge Applications: projetado para que Clientes construam e executem suas próprias aplicações serverless no Edge da rede, mais próximo a usuários e dispositivos. É ideal para aplicações que exigem baixos tempos de resposta ou processamento de dados em tempo real. Cada Edge Application pode ser atrelado a múltiplos domínios, que por sua vez são acessíveis por usuários e dispositivos. Para garantir o bom funcionamento dos serviços, a Azion poderá habilitar, desabilitar ou modificar serviços, POPs, endereços IPs, servidores, qualquer equipamento e conteúdo do cliente, sem aviso prévio, sempre visando a manutenção ou melhora da performance e disponibilidade dos mesmos. Salvo disposição em contrário no Contrato de Cliente ou quaisquer documentos anexos a ele, a cobrança do Edge Applications se dará pela quantidade de Edge Applications, de acordo com os volumes consumidos.\n\nEdge Firewall: módulo do Edge Applications projetado para realizar o controle e bloqueio de acessos ao conteúdo e aplicações diretamente nos Edge Servers da Azion. O controle e o bloqueio de acesso podem ser realizados por endereço IP ou rede, geolocalização (país de acesso), ASN, HTTP Referer e Secure Token. A Azion utiliza bases de dados de fornecedores externos para identificação de geolocalização baseada no endereço IP do Usuário, as quais podem ser imprecisas em algumas situações, cabendo ao Cliente a responsabilidade pelo uso dessa funcionalidade de restrição de acesso. O bloqueio por HTTP Referer se baseia em informações fornecidas pelo Browser ou aplicação que requisita o conteúdo, podendo ter sofrido manipulação maliciosa por parte do Usuário para obter acesso indevido, cabendo, portanto, ao Cliente a responsabilidade por esse tipo de controle de acesso. Secure Token representa um mecanismo de validação de acesso baseado em Hash MD5, cabendo ao Cliente a segurança da Secret utilizada para geração do Hash. A AZION PROVÊ MECANISMOS DE CONTROLE DE ACESSO BASEADOS NO MELHOR ESFORÇO, MAS QUE NÃO CONSTITUEM RESTRIÇÕES INTRANSPONÍVEIS CONTRA ACESSOS NÃO AUTORIZADOS. O CLIENTE DEVE REALIZAR A RESTRIÇÃO DE ACESSO POR ENDEREÇO IP PARA OBTER O MELHOR NÍVEL DE CONTROLE E A AZION RECOMENDA A COMBINAÇÃO DE MÚLTIPLAS TÉCNICAS. Salvo disposição em contrário no Contrato de Cliente ou quaisquer documentos anexos a ele, a cobrança do Edge Firewall se dará pelas Requests de acordo com os volumes consumidos.\n\nEdge Functions: módulo do Edge Applications projetado para realizar a execução de código de função nos Edge Servers da Azion, disparado por uma requisição de usuário ou dispositivo, sem a necessidade do cliente ter que provisionar ou gerenciar a infraestrutura para execução do mesmo. O código da função deve receber 3 parâmetros obrigatórios: (a) o handler da requisição; (b) o handler para a resposta; e (c) um JSON de parametrização de variáveis. O código de função pode ser utilizado para manipulação ou transformação da requisição ou da resposta. A função criada deve ser associada a um Edge Application, onde deverá ser parametrizada por meio de um argumento formatado em JSON com as variáveis da função. O gatilho com as condições para execução da função deverá ser configurado no Edge Application em que a função estiver associada. Cada requisição que atenda às condições de execução configuradas é considera uma invocação (\"Invocation\") que dispara a execução da função. A AZION PODERÁ ENCERRAR, SEM AVISO PRÉVIO, A EXECUÇÃO DE FUNÇÕES QUE ESTEJAM: (A) CONSUMINDO MAIS DO QUE A MEMÓRIA MÁXIMA DEFINIDA; OU (B) EXECUTANDO POR MAIS TEMPO QUE O MÁXIMO DEFINIDO. A AZION PODERÁ REMOVER FUNÇÕES CRIADAS E QUE NÃO TENHAM SIDO EXECUTADAS HÁ MAIS DE TRÊS (3) MESES. O CLIENTE É RESPONSÁVEL POR SEU CONTEÚDO, INCLUINDO: (A) A PERFORMANCE DO CÓDIGO QUE UTILIZA; (B) O LICENCIAMENTO PARA USO DE CÓDIGO DE TERCEIROS OU O RESPEITO AOS TERMOS DE USO DO MESMO; E (C) A SEGURANÇA DO CÓDIGO FONTE QUE UTILIZA. Salvo disposição em contrário no Contrato de Cliente ou quaisquer documentos anexos a ele, a cobrança do Edge Functions se dará pelo (a) Compute Time e (b) Invocations, de acordo com os volumes consumidos.\n\nImage Optimization: módulo do Edge Applications projetado para otimizar e manipular imagens dinamicamente, incluindo as seguintes funcionalidades: (1) otimização; (2) corte; (3) redimensionamento; (4) conversão de formato e (5) aplicações de filtros como blur, noise, marca d'água, dentre outros. Os formatos suportados são JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP e ICO. A manipulação das imagens é realizada através de parâmetros de Query String enviados na requisição. A otimização da imagem consiste no processo de reduzir o tamanho do arquivo de imagem, quando possível, buscando minimizar as perdas de qualidade perceptíveis da imagem, decorrentes do processo de otimização.

Não há SLA para Produtos ou funcionalidades em Early Access, por se tratar de um teste com disponibilidade limitada de recursos, antes que as liberações sejam realizadas para uso mais amplo. O objetivo da Azion neste estágio é validar a funcionalidade e coletar feedback de um conjunto limitado de Clientes. Produtos neste estágio não precisam estar completos. Neste estágio o Produto ou funcionalidade é geralmente adequado para uso apenas nos ambientes de teste do Cliente. O estágio de Early Access pode durar alguns meses (1 a 2 meses).\n\n**Beta:** na versão Beta, Produtos ou funcionalidades estão prontos para testes e uso mais amplos pelos Clientes. O estágio Beta é frequentemente anunciado publicamente pela Azion. Não há SLAs para uma versão Beta, a menos que especificado de outra forma nos termos de um programa Beta específico. A fase Beta pode durar cerca de 6 meses. Geralmente o estágio Beta é adequado para uso em ambientes de teste e produção, e o Cliente pode ser cobrado pelo uso do Produto.\n\n**General Availability:**  os Produtos e funcionalidades em General Availability estão abertos a todos os Clientes, cobertos pelos SLAs da Azion quando aplicável, e estão prontos para uso em ambiente de produção, de acordo com estes Termos de Serviço.\n\n**Deprecated:** os Produtos e funcionalidades Deprecated estão programados para serem encerrados e removidos (End-Of-Life, EOL). Todos os clientes devem ser notificados de acordo com as regras do Contrato do Cliente. Não há SLA para Produtos e funcionalidades Deprecated, assim como não há compromisso para correção de Bugs ou evolução das funcionalidades desses Produtos. A Azion poderá encerrar o Produto e remover os dados do Cliente na data de End-Of-Life notificada, cabendo aos Clientes a cópia de seus dados e configurações ou a migração para outro Produto, quando aplicável.\n\n----\n\n#### Versões anteriores deste documento:\n\n[Termo de Serviço – 10 de Novembro de 2020](/pt-br/documentacao/contratos/tds/10-novembro-2020/)\n\n[Termo de Serviço – 15 de Maio de 2019](/pt-br/documentacao/contratos/tds/15-maio-2019/)\n\n[Termo de Serviço – 25 de Outubro de 2017](/pt-br/documentacao/contratos/tds/25-outubro-2017/)\n\n[Termo de Serviço – 10 de Novembro de 2016](/pt-br/documentacao/contratos/tds/10-novembro-2016/)\n\n",

    "body": "\n*Última atualização realizada em 25 de Outubro de 2017.*\n\nAs seguintes definições referentes aos produtos e serviços, metodologias de cobrança e demais termos são aplicáveis à contratação e uso dos Produtos e Serviços Azion. Buscamos aprimorar constantemente as nossas soluções e, em decorrência disso, este documento pode sofrer atualizações, devendo sempre ser consultado em sua última versão.\n\nTodos os produtos e serviços da Azion são oferecidos como Cloud Services e são acessíveis por meio dos protocolos de comunicação específicos da Internet. Nossos servidores estão localizados em diversos pontos de presença (POPs) espalhados pelo mundo. A orquestração e configuração dos Produtos e Serviços Azion é feita pela interface do Real-Time Manager ou suas APIs. Os produtos e serviços são tarifados de acordo com o uso, modalidade de contratação e preços conforme definido no Contrato de Cliente.\n\n## 1. Produtos e Serviços\n\nContent Delivery: projetado para entregar conteúdos web de qualquer formato e tipo, inclusive HTTP Live Streaming (HLS), por meio dos protocolos HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1 e HTTP/2 e com suporte aos métodos HTTP GET, HEAD e OPTIONS. Inclui acesso a (1) rede da Azion para entrega de conteúdo; (2) funcionalidade de cache de conteúdos; (3) manipulação de cabeçalhos HTTP; (4) criação de regras para redirecionamento, bloqueio de acesso ou entrega do conteúdo; (5) Analytics Standard com indicadores básicos do serviço; (6) ferramenta de Real-Time Purge; (7) entrega de conteúdo em cache enquanto a origem estiver inacessível; (8) entrega de conteúdo HTTPS (TLS) com suporte a OCSP Stapling; (9) upload de certificado digital e suporte ao formato TLS x509 SNI, caso suportado pelo browser do usuário, ou uso do certificado compartilhado no domínio da Azion; (10) serviço de Raw Logs; e (11) integração com os Produtos e Serviços da Azion. Para utilizar este serviço, é necessário que o Cliente faça o armazenamento da versão original de Seu Conteúdo em um servidor web de origem, que pode ser o Cloud Storage da Azion ou qualquer servidor com acesso HTTP. Para garantir o bom funcionamento dos serviços, a Azion poderá habilitar, desabilitar ou modificar serviços, POPs, endereços IPs, servidores, qualquer equipamento e conteúdo do cliente, sem aviso prévio, sempre visando a manutenção ou melhora da performance e disponibilidade dos mesmos. Salvo disposição em contrário no Contrato de Cliente ou quaisquer documentos anexos a ele, a cobrança do Content Delivery se dará pelo (a) Total Data Transferred; (b) Requests; (c) Purge Requests; e (d) Configurations, de acordo com os volumes consumidos. NÃO EXISTE UMA GARANTIA DE QUE O CONTEÚDO (OBJETO) ESTARÁ DISPONÍVEL EM CACHE DURANTE TODA DURAÇÃO DO TIME-TO-LIVE (TTL) CONFIGURADO PELO CLIENTE. A AZION FAZ OS INVESTIMENTOS NECESSÁRIOS PARA MANTER OS DADOS EM CACHE PELO TEMPO MAIS PRÓXIMO DO QUE FOR CONFIGURADO PELOS CLIENTES, PORÉM OS OBJETOS MENOS ACESSADOS PODEM SER AUTOMATICAMENTE REMOVIDOS DO CACHE PARA CEDER ESPAÇO PARA OBJETOS DE MAIOR VOLUME DE ACESSOS ATRAVÉS DE UM ALGORITMO DE LRU (LEAST RECENTLY USED). O TAMANHO MÁXIMO DE OBJETO É DE 10GB E, PARA UTILIZAR O SERVIÇO COM OBJETOS MAIORES É NECESSÁRIO AUTORIZAÇÃO DA AZION POR ESCRITO.\n\nApplication Acceleration: projetado para acelerar aplicações web e APIs. Inclui acesso a funcionalidades de otimização de protocolos, regras avançadas de cache (Advanced Cache Key) que permite o cache granular, segmentação e políticas de cache com base em critérios como name/value de Cookies e Query Strings, além de funcionalidades como Bypass Cache, KeepAlive e Forward Cookies. Disponibiliza os métodos HTTP GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE e OPTIONS. Salvo disposição em contrário no Contrato de Cliente ou quaisquer documentos anexos a ele, a cobrança do Application Acceleration se dará pelo Data Transferred de acordo com os volumes consumidos.\n\nAdaptive Delivery: projetado para fazer a detecção de dispositivos baseado na User Agent String enviada pelo Usuário, permitindo a entrega de conteúdos para diferentes dispositivos e formatos a partir da mesma URL. A eficiência do produto depende da correta configuração das expressões regulares que viabilizam o mapeamento dos tipos de dispositivos e correspondentes User Agent Strings. É responsabilidade do Cliente a manutenção e atualização da lista de grupos de dispositivos, que pode contar com as listas pré-definidas pela Azion. Cabe ao servidor de origem do Cliente a entrega do conteúdo mais adequado para cada tipo de dispositivo, de acordo com a detecção realizada pelo Adaptive Delivery e informada ao servidor de origem por meio de um campo de cabeçalho HTTP customizável. As variações de conteúdo poderão ser cacheadas nos Edge Servers da Azion, de acordo com as configurações definidas. Salvo disposição em contrário no Contrato de Cliente ou quaisquer documentos anexos a ele, a cobrança do Adaptive Delivery se dará pelo Data Transferred de acordo com os volumes consumidos.\n\nLoad Balancer: projetado para balancear o tráfego HTTP/HTTPS do cliente entre origens distribuídas em múltiplos datacenters, provedores de serviço (multi-cloud) ou em um mesmo datacenter, eliminando ou minimizando a necessidade de hardware ou software dedicadas e reduzindo o impacto de falhas locais na disponibilidade global do conteúdo. Inclui acesso às funcionalidades de (1) balanceamento Round-Robin, Least Connections e IP Hash; (2) atribuição de diferentes pesos às origens; (3) configuração de servidores Primary ou Backup (standby); (4) manipulação de erros e exceções em caso de timeout para conectar ou receber uma resposta da origem, ou em caso da resposta HTTP da origem ser um erro 404 (Not Found) ou 5xx. Salvo disposição em contrário no Contrato de Cliente ou quaisquer documentos anexos a ele, a cobrança do Load Balancer se dará pelo Data Transferred de acordo com os volumes consumidos.\n\nRaw Logs: provê o envio dos logs de diversos Produtos e Serviços Azion para o Azion Cloud Storage. Requer que o serviço de Raw Logs esteja habilitado para as configurações desejadas para que os logs sejam salvos. Os logs serão armazenados em formato texto, compactados ou não, no Cloud Storage por no máximo 45 dias, sendo rotacionados após esse período, processo que remove os logs mais antigos liberando espaço para inclusão de novos. O acesso aos logs é disponibilizado através dos mesmos meios de acesso ao Cloud Storage. Salvo disposição em contrário no Contrato de Cliente ou quaisquer documentos anexos a ele, a cobrança do Raw Logs se dará apenas pelo Used Space do Cloud Storage de acordo com os volumes consumidos. EM CASO DO CLIENTE ESTAR SOB ATAQUE, APENAS AMOSTRAS DO LOG PODERÃO SER DISPONIBILIZADAS DURANTE A OCORRÊNCIA DO ATAQUE.\n\nAnalytics: projetado para o monitoramento de indicadores dos Produtos e Serviços Azion. Provê uma interface web para análise de gráficos e indicadores coletados de acordo com as configurações dos Clientes.

O controle e o bloqueio de acesso podem ser realizados por endereço IP ou rede, geolocalização (país de acesso), HTTP Referer, Secure Token e Rate Limit. A Azion utiliza bases de dados de fornecedores externos para identificação de geolocalização baseada no endereço IP do Usuário, as quais podem ser imprecisas em algumas situações, cabendo ao Cliente a responsabilidade pelo uso dessa funcionalidade de restrição de acesso. O bloqueio por HTTP Referer se baseia em informações fornecidas pelo Browser ou aplicação que requisita o conteúdo, podendo ter sofrido manipulação maliciosa por parte do Usuário para obter acesso indevido, cabendo, portanto, ao Cliente a responsabilidade por esse tipo de controle de acesso. Rate Limit é calculado individualmente para cada Edge Server da Azion, não constituindo, portanto, um limite global de acesso ao conteúdo. Secure Token representa um mecanismo de validação de acesso baseado em Hash MD5, cabendo ao Cliente a segurança da Secret utilizada para geração do Hash. Salvo disposição em contrário no Contrato de Cliente ou quaisquer documentos anexos a ele, a cobrança do Edge Firewall se dará pelas Requests de acordo com os volumes consumidos. A AZION PROVÊ MECANISMOS DE CONTROLE DE ACESSO BASEADOS NO MELHOR ESFORÇO, MAS QUE NÃO CONSTITUEM RESTRIÇÕES INTRANSPONÍVEIS CONTRA ACESSOS NÃO AUTORIZADOS. O CLIENTE DEVE REALIZAR A RESTRIÇÃO DE ACESSO POR ENDEREÇO IP PARA OBTER O MELHOR NÍVEL DE CONTROLE E A AZION RECOMENDA A COMBINAÇÃO DE MÚLTIPLAS TÉCNICAS.\n\nWeb Application Firewall (WAF): projetado para proteger sites e aplicações web e inclui funcionalidades como: (1) controle para mitigar ameaças como SQL Injections, Cross-Site Scripting, RFI, entre outros; (2) criação de Rule Sets configuráveis para seleção dos mecanismos de proteção desejados e sensibilidade das regras; (3) criação de Whitelists customizadas de acordo com o comportamento da aplicação; (4) opção de Counting Mode para análise de ameaças sem o efetivo bloqueio das mesmas; (5) gráficos em tempo real contendo informações sobre ameaças detectadas e ataques bloqueados. Recomendamos habilitar a funcionalidade de Counting Mode assistido pelo Integration Services da Azion para etapa de aprendizado dos comportamentos da aplicação, para melhorar a eficiência do serviço e reduzir o risco de identificação de falsos positivos e bloqueio de requisições legítimas. Ainda assim, advertimos de que pode haver o bloqueio de requisições legítimas à aplicação, caso coincidam com alguma das regras de segurança do WAF. Salvo disposição em contrário no Contrato de Cliente ou quaisquer documentos anexos a ele, a cobrança do WAF se dará pelo (a) número de Requests; (b) número de WAF Rules e WAF Rule Sets, de acordo com os volumes consumidos. A AZION ESTÁ CONSTANTEMENTE BUSCANDO ATUALIZAÇÃO DE SEUS MECANISMOS DE SEGURANÇA PARA AUMENTAR A EFETIVIDADE DOS SISTEMAS DE PROTEÇÃO E REDUZIR O RISCO DE IMPACTO ÀS APLICAÇÕES DO CLIENTE, E UTILIZARÁ FERRAMENTAS DE TESTE DE SEGURANÇA (PENTEST) NA APLICAÇÃO DO CLIENTE, COM O INTUITO DE MELHORAR ESTES MECANISMOS DE SEGURANÇA. NO ENTANTO, NÃO HÁ UMA GARANTIA DE QUE O SERVIÇO WAF SERÁ CAPAZ DE PREVENIR TODAS AS POSSIBILIDADES DE ATAQUES OU AMEAÇAS. RECOMENDAMOS QUE OS CLIENTES MANTENHAM OS CONTROLES DE SEGURANÇA TAMBÉM EM SUAS ORIGENS. O CLIENTE ASSUME TODO O RISCO DE INDISPONIBILIDADE DE SERVIÇO DEVIDO A REGRAS MAL CONFIGURADAS NO SERVIÇO.\n\nImage Optimization: projetado para otimizar e manipular imagens dinamicamente, incluindo as seguintes funcionalidades: (1) otimização; (2) corte; (3) redimensionamento; (4) conversão de formato e (5) aplicações de filtros como blur, noise, marca d’água, dentre outros. Os formatos suportados são JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP e ICO. A manipulação das imagens é realizada através de parâmetros de Query String enviados na requisição. A otimização da imagem consiste no processo de reduzir o tamanho do arquivo de imagem, quando possível, buscando minimizar as perdas de qualidade perceptíveis da imagem, decorrentes do processo de otimização. A imagem poderá ser entregue em um formato de arquivo distinto do original, de acordo com o Browser de acesso do Usuário, buscando uma melhor otimização da entrega (ex: webp). Não há uma garantia de ganho no processo de otimização cabendo ao cliente monitorar o ganho médio decorrente do uso do serviço. Salvo disposição em contrário no Contrato de Cliente ou quaisquer documentos anexos a ele, a cobrança do Image Optimization se dará pelas Images Processed de acordo com os volumes consumidos. O CLIENTE DEVE ESTAR CIENTE DE QUE O PROCESSO DE OTIMIZAÇÃO DE IMAGENS ALTERA O CONTEÚDO ENTREGUE PARA O USUÁRIO FINAL, PODENDO RESULTAR EM DIFERENÇAS NA QUALIDADE VISUAL DA IMAGEM. A AZION PODERÁ, A QUALQUER MOMENTO E SEM AVISO PRÉVIO, ATUALIZAR OS ALGORITMOS DE OTIMIZAÇÃO, RESULTANDO EM DIFERENÇAS NO CONTEÚDO ENTREGUE E NA EFICIÊNCIA DA OTIMIZAÇÃO.\n\nCloud Storage: projetado para armazenar dados em nuvem com alta disponibilidade, replicação multi-datacenter, segurança e durabilidade. Pode ser utilizado como servidor de origem para o Content Delivery e é integrado a outros serviços, como Media Packager e Raw Logs. A transferência dos arquivos para o Cloud Storage pode ser realizada utilizando-se o protocolo S3. Salvo disposição em contrário no Contrato de Cliente ou quaisquer documentos anexos a ele, a cobrança do Cloud Storage se dará pelo (a) Used Space; (b) Requests; e (c) Data Transferred, de acordo com os volumes consumidos.\n\nLive Ingest: projetado para a receber a ingestão de sinais Live Streaming e realizar a distribuição do mesmo para a rede de Content Delivery. A ingestão da transmissão Live deve ser realizada utilizando-se o protocolo RTMP, autenticada através de usuário e senha e utilizando um encoder homologado pela Azion. Para melhorar a disponibilidade da transmissão, recomenda-se a configuração de dois RTMP Endpoints, um Primary e um Backup, em regiões geográficas distintas. O serviço provê a funcionalidade de Dynamic Packaging, para converter o formato de entrega para HLS, para que possa ser distribuído pelo Content Delivery em HTTP. O encoder do Cliente deve respeitar as recomendações de configuração, formatos e codecs suportados pelo serviço e homologados pela Azion. Salvo disposição em contrário no Contrato de Cliente ou quaisquer documentos anexos a ele, a cobrança do Live Ingest se dará pelo Data Ingested de acordo com os volumes consumidos.\n\nMedia Packager: projetado para empacotar em tempo real arquivos de mídias (áudio e vídeo) para entrega pela rede de Content Delivery. Os formatos de mídia suportados são FLV (Flash Video), MP4 (QuickTime – .mp4, .f4v, .mov, .m4v, .mp4a, .3gp, .3g2), .ismv, .isma e MP3 (.mp3). O formato de entrega é HTTP Live Streaming (HLS). Os arquivos de mídia devem ser armazenados em um bucket do Cloud Storage com Media Packager habilitado.

Disponibiliza os métodos HTTP GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE e OPTIONS. Salvo disposição em contrário no Contrato de Cliente ou quaisquer documentos anexos a ele, a cobrança do Application Acceleration se dará pelo Data Transferred de acordo com os volumes consumidos.\n\n**Data Streaming:** projetado para realizar a coleta de dados das requisições a Edge Applications ou outros Produtos e Serviços Azion. As informações que devem ser coletadas são selecionadas pelo cliente, que desde já se declara autorizado por seus usuários a coletar e processar informações recebidas nas requisições. A AZION NÃO SE RESPONSABILIZA PELO: (A) USO QUE SERÁ DADO PELO CLIENTE AOS DADOS COLETADOS; (B) DIREITO QUE O CLIENTE TEM DE COLETAR DADOS DE SEUS USUÁRIOS. As informações coletadas são enviadas para a infraestrutura do cliente utilizando o protocolo escolhido pelo Cliente na interface do Real-Time Manager ou API, no formato NDJSON (Newline Delimited JSON), definido em um template configurável. O envio dos dados é realizado em blocos de 2 mil requisições, separados por \\\\n (Newline), ou 60 segundos, o que ocorrer antes. A Azion fará todos os esforços comercialmente razoáveis para enviar os dados para a infraestrutura do cliente, ou de seus fornecedores, em tempo real ou com atraso inferior a 3 minutos, no entanto, em casos de picos de acesso, ataques ou causas externas a Azion, o atraso pode superar o previsto. O CLIENTE É RESPONSÁVEL PELA DISPONIBILIDADE DE SUA INFRAESTRUTURA DE RECEBIMENTO DOS DADOS E, EM CASO DE INDISPONIBILIDADE DA MESMA, A AZION PODERÁ DESCARTAR OS DADOS COLETADOS. Salvo disposição em contrário no Contrato de Cliente ou quaisquer documentos anexos a ele, a cobrança do Data Streaming se dará por (a) Data Streaming Requests e (b) Data Streamed, de acordo com os volumes consumidos.\n\n**DDoS Protection:** O DDoS Protection será prestado única e exclusivamente de acordo com os termos disponíveis em https://www.azion.com/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-firewall/ddos-protection/ (“Diretrizes”).

Ao contratar o serviço DDoS Protection, o Cliente fica obrigado a pagar por um mínimo de doze (12) meses do serviço. Se a fatura média do Cliente exceder o seu volume contratado, ou se mais de dois créditos forem solicitados em um determinado ano calendário, a Azion terá o direito de exigir que o Cliente pague um DDoS Protection Fee adicional para cada ataque DDoS sofrido. Um único crédito poderá ser aplicado mensalmente, mesmo quando vários ataques ocorrerem no mês. O crédito deve ser emitido como nota de crédito e não uma nota fiscal revisada. A AZION ESTÁ CONSTANTEMENTE BUSCANDO ATUALIZAÇÃO DE SEUS MECANISMOS DE SEGURANÇA PARA AUMENTAR A EFETIVIDADE DOS SISTEMAS DE PROTEÇÃO E REDUZIR O RISCO DE IMPACTO ÀS APLICAÇÕES DO CLIENTE. NO ENTANTO, NÃO HÁ UMA GARANTIA DE QUE O SERVIÇO DDOS SERÁ CAPAZ DE PREVENIR TODAS AS POSSIBILIDADES DE ATAQUES OU AMEAÇAS. RECOMENDAMOS QUE OS CLIENTES MANTENHAM OS CONTROLES DE SEGURANÇA TAMBÉM EM SUAS ORIGENS. O CLIENTE ASSUME TODO O RISCO DE INDISPONIBILIDADE DE SERVIÇO DEVIDO A REGRAS MAL CONFIGURADAS NO SERVIÇO.\n\n**Digital Certificates:** é o serviço de intermediação e manutenção da emissão de certificados SSL compartilhados, do tipo Domain Validated (DV), junto a uma Autoridade Certificadora (CA) de escolha da Azion, para uso único e exclusivo em Edge Applications.

O certificado SSL e chave privada são compartilhados entre múltiplos Clientes e serão de posse exclusiva da Azion. O certificado e ou chave privada não será, sob hipótese alguma, enviado ao Cliente. Salvo disposição em contrário no Contrato de Cliente ou quaisquer documentos anexos a ele, a cobrança do Digital Certificates se dará pelo número de Digital Certificates de acordo com os volumes consumidos.\n\n**Edge Application:** projetado para que Clientes construam e executem suas próprias aplicações serverless no Edge da rede, mais próximo a usuários e dispositivos. É ideal para aplicações que exigem baixos tempos de resposta ou processamento de dados em tempo real. Cada Edge Application pode ser atrelado a múltiplos domínios, que por sua vez são acessíveis por usuários e dispositivos. Para garantir o bom funcionamento dos serviços, a Azion poderá habilitar, desabilitar ou modificar serviços, POPs, endereços IPs, servidores, qualquer equipamento e conteúdo do cliente, sem aviso prévio, sempre visando a manutenção ou melhora da performance e disponibilidade dos mesmos. Salvo disposição em contrário no Contrato de Cliente ou quaisquer documentos anexos a ele, a cobrança do Edge Application se dará pela quantidade de (a) Domains, (b) Edge Applications, (c) Total Data Transferred e (d) Requests, de acordo com os volumes consumidos, e pelo volume consumido por seus módulos.\n\n**Edge Caching:** módulo do Edge Application projetado para entregar conteúdos web de qualquer formato e tipo, inclusive HTTP Live Streaming (HLS), por meio dos protocolos HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1 e HTTP/2 e com suporte aos métodos HTTP GET, HEAD e OPTIONS.

NÃO EXISTE UMA GARANTIA DE QUE O CONTEÚDO (OBJETO) ESTARÁ DISPONÍVEL EM CACHE DURANTE TODA DURAÇÃO DO TIME-TO-LIVE (TTL) CONFIGURADO PELO CLIENTE. A AZION FAZ OS INVESTIMENTOS NECESSÁRIOS PARA MANTER OS DADOS EM CACHE PELO TEMPO MAIS PRÓXIMO DO QUE FOR CONFIGURADO PELOS CLIENTES, PORÉM OS OBJETOS MENOS ACESSADOS PODEM SER AUTOMATICAMENTE REMOVIDOS DO CACHE PARA CEDER ESPAÇO PARA OBJETOS DE MAIOR VOLUME DE ACESSOS ATRAVÉS DE UM ALGORITMO DE LRU (LEAST RECENTLY USED). O TAMANHO MÁXIMO DE OBJETO É DE 10GB E, PARA UTILIZAR O SERVIÇO COM OBJETOS MAIORES É NECESSÁRIO AUTORIZAÇÃO DA AZION POR ESCRITO. Salvo disposição em contrário no Contrato de Cliente ou quaisquer documentos anexos a ele, a cobrança do Edge Caching se dará pelo (a) Total Data Transferred; (b) Requests; e (c) Real-Time Purge Operations, de acordo com os volumes consumidos.\n\n**Edge Firewall:** projetado para que Clientes construam e executem suas regras de firewall no Edge da rede, mais próximo a usuários e dispositivos.

O código da função deve receber 3 parâmetros obrigatórios: (a) o handler da requisição; (b) o handler para a resposta; e (c) um JSON de parametrização de variáveis. O código de função pode ser utilizado para manipulação ou transformação da requisição ou da resposta. A função criada deve ser associada a um Edge Application ou Edge Firewall, onde deverá ser parametrizada por meio de um argumento formatado em JSON com as variáveis da função. O gatilho com as condições para execução da função deverá ser configurado no Edge Application ou Edge Firewall em que a função estiver associada. Cada requisição que atenda às condições de execução configuradas é considera uma invocação (\"Invocation\") que dispara a execução da função. A AZION PODERÁ ENCERRAR, SEM AVISO PRÉVIO, A EXECUÇÃO DE FUNÇÕES QUE ESTEJAM: (A) CONSUMINDO MAIS DO QUE A MEMÓRIA MÁXIMA DEFINIDA; OU (B) EXECUTANDO POR MAIS TEMPO QUE O MÁXIMO DEFINIDO. A AZION PODERÁ REMOVER FUNÇÕES CRIADAS E QUE NÃO TENHAM SIDO EXECUTADAS HÁ MAIS DE TRÊS (3) MESES. O CLIENTE É RESPONSÁVEL POR SEU CONTEÚDO, INCLUINDO: (A) A PERFORMANCE DO CÓDIGO QUE UTILIZA; (B) O LICENCIAMENTO PARA USO DE CÓDIGO DE TERCEIROS OU O RESPEITO AOS TERMOS DE USO DO MESMO; E (C) A SEGURANÇA DO CÓDIGO FONTE QUE UTILIZA.

Essas interfaces permitem então o registro e a configuração desses Edge Nodes do Cliente, bem como a criação e a personalização de Edge Services que podem ser orquestrados em tempo real nos Nodes pré-cadastrados. Os serviços a serem orquestrados são baseados em arquivos de configuração e scripts a serem fornecidos pelo Cliente e que serão executados nos dispositivos onde o agente estiver instalado. Salvo disposições no Contrato de Cliente ou quaisquer documentos anexos a ele, a cobrança do Edge Orchestrator se dará por (a) Orchestrated Edge Nodes e (b) Total Orchestrated Data.\n\n**Edge Pulse:** projetado para monitorar, em tempo real, a performance e a qualidade de acesso dos usuários às aplicações web do cliente. Podem ser coletadas informações como tempo de resposta no acesso de usuários, além de informações dos servidores utilizados para responder à requisição do usuário. Para ativá-lo é preciso copiar a tag do Edge Pulse e inserí-la nas páginas HTML desejadas. Ao fazer isso o cliente se declara autorizado por seus usuários a coletar e processar as informações descritas acima. Os dados coletados poderão ser utilizados pela Azion para melhorar a performance e a confiabilidade no acesso aos Edge Applications. A AZION NÃO SE RESPONSABILIZA PELO: (A) USO QUE SERÁ DADO PELO CLIENTE AOS DADOS COLETADOS; (B) DIREITO QUE O CLIENTE TEM DE COLETAR DADOS DE SEUS USUÁRIOS, POIS AO INSERIR A TAG DO PULSE EM SUAS PÁGINAS ESTARÁ, AUTOMATICAMENTE, AUTORIZANDO A AZION A COLETAR ESSAS INFORMAÇÕES. (C) REMOÇÃO DA TAG DE SUAS PÁGINAS EM CASO DE DESISTÊNCIA DO PRODUTO. A Azion se compromete em não coletar nenhuma informação sigilosa ou pessoal dos seus usuários e também na correta aplicação das informações coletadas para aprimorar, constantemente, seus algoritmos de entrega com objetivo claro de garantir a melhor experiência possível a quem acessar a nossa Edge Network. A utilização do Edge Pulse deve seguir as orientações dispostas na documentação do produto. Dessa forma irá garantir que a sua execução será exclusivamente assíncrona, ou seja, não trará impactos no tempo de carregamento e nem irá interferir em estruturas internas da página onde está inserida. Informações relacionadas a navegação dos usuários serão disponibilizadas aos clientes através do Real-Time Events e Data Streaming.\n\n**Image Processor:** módulo do Edge Application projetado para otimizar e manipular imagens dinamicamente, incluindo as seguintes funcionalidades: (1) otimização; (2) corte; (3) redimensionamento; (4) conversão de formato e (5) aplicações de filtros como blur, noise, marca d'água, dentre outros. Os formatos suportados são JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP e ICO. A manipulação das imagens é realizada através de parâmetros de Query String enviados na requisição. A otimização da imagem consiste no processo de reduzir o tamanho do arquivo de imagem, quando possível, buscando minimizar as perdas de qualidade perceptíveis da imagem, decorrentes do processo de otimização. A imagem poderá ser entregue em um formato de arquivo distinto do original, de acordo com o Browser de acesso do Usuário, buscando uma melhor otimização da entrega (ex: webp). Não há uma garantia de ganho no processo de otimização cabendo ao cliente monitorar o ganho médio decorrente do uso do serviço. O CLIENTE DEVE ESTAR CIENTE DE QUE O PROCESSO DE OTIMIZAÇÃO DE IMAGENS ALTERA O CONTEÚDO ENTREGUE PARA O USUÁRIO FINAL, PODENDO RESULTAR EM DIFERENÇAS NA QUALIDADE VISUAL DA IMAGEM. A AZION PODERÁ, A QUALQUER MOMENTO E SEM AVISO PRÉVIO, ATUALIZAR OS ALGORITMOS DE OTIMIZAÇÃO, RESULTANDO EM DIFERENÇAS NO CONTEÚDO ENTREGUE E NA EFICIÊNCIA DA OTIMIZAÇÃO.

    "body": "\nVeja como acessar a **API GraphQL** da Azion e o playground da GraphQL.\n\n\n---\n\n## Acessar a API GraphQL\n\nPara utilizar a **API GraphQL** com plataformas de API, como Postman e Insomnia, você precisa autenticar seu acesso para garantir que as requisições sejam realizadas de forma segura. A autenticação ocorre através do uso de **Tokens**.\n\nPara criar um Token, você tem duas opções:\n\n- Utilizar a **plataforma de API** da Azion.\n- Usar o **Real-Time Manager (RTM)**.\n\nA primeira opção é criar um **Token** através da [plataforma de API](https://api.azion.com/) da Azion. Vá até [Token](https://api.azion.com/#1b90377d-6f99-4f09-bf4a-9ed630a75afd) e execute a sua requisição.\n\nA segunda opção é criar um **Personal Token** através da interface de configuração da Azion, [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/). Essa opção pode ser mais adequada para uso com APIs, pois proporciona a criação de um token de longa duração. Veja a página de documentação de [Personal Tokens](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/gestao-de-contas/personal-tokens/) para mais informações.\n\n> Ao criar um Personal Token, você deve informar uma *data de expiração*. Para uso com APIs, é recomendado usar uma data de expiração mais longa, como *90 dias* ou *1 ano*. Nesse caso, tome as medidas necessárias para garantir a segurança do seu projeto.\n\nApós criar o seu Personal Token, vá para a plataforma de API de sua escolha e inclua o endpoint da **API GraphQL** da Azion em sua requisição:\n\n- Para usar a API Metrics com dados agregados, inclua: `https://api.azionapi.net/metrics/graphql`\n- Para usar a API Events com dados brutos, inclua: `https://api.azionapi.net/events/graphql`\n\n---\n\n## Acessar o playground GraphQL\n\nVocê pode usar o playground da **GraphQL** da Azion para escrever, validar e testar queries da GraphQL. Usar o playground também ajuda a conhecer melhor a API e o uso de queries de forma visual e rápida.\n\nPara interagir com o playground da GraphQL, você deve estar [logado no RTM](https://manager.azion.com/). Se você ainda não criou uma conta, veja a página de documentação [Criar uma conta na Azion](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/gestao-de-contas/criar-conta/).\n\nApós fazer login no **RTM**, acesse `https://manager.azion.com/metrics/graphql` ou `https://manager.azion.com/events/graphql` para interagir com o playground da **GraphQL**.\n\nAssista um tutorial sobre os primeiros passos da GraphQL no canal do YouTube da Azion, com opção de ativar legendas em português:\n\n<iframe\n   src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tVyRGO-n_rI\"\n   loading=\"lazy\"\n   width=\"600\"\n   height=\"400\"\n   title=\"First Steps with GraphQL\"\n   frameborder=\"0\"\n   allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\n   allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n",

    "body": "\nAs queries são o ponto de partida para consultar informações. Você usa uma query para solicitar informações de um banco de dados. A **API GraphQL** conta com as queries para buscar valores e retornar os dados solicitados em formato semelhante a um arquivo JSON.\n\nO uso de queries possibilita solicitar e buscar dados específicos. Assim, mesmo utilizando uma query breve, você consegue receber uma resposta para a sua solicitação apenas com os dados que deseja, sem demais dados que não sejam essenciais naquele momento. O uso de queries também proporciona respostas mais rápidas, já que a API não busca uma quantidade desnecessária de dados.\n\nAs queries também facilitam adicionar ou deletar informações de suas requisição. Por exemplo, se você faz uma requisição de dados de `httpMetrics`:\n\n```graphql\nquery HttpQuery {\n  httpMetrics(\n    limit: 2\n    filter: {\n      tsRange: {begin:\"2022-10-20T10:10:10\", end:\"2022-10-23T10:10:10\"}\n    }\n  ) \n  {\t\n    ts\n    sourceLocPop\n    requests\n  }\n}\n```\n\nE decide que quer adicionar dados de `idnsQueriesMetrics` à sua requisição, você pode adicionar uma query semelhante, modificando apenas o dataset que você deseja buscar, e rodar outra requisição:\n\n```graphql\nquery IdnsQuery {\n  idnsQueriesMetrics(\n    limit: 2\n    filter: {\n      tsRange: {begin:\"2022-10-20T10:10:10\", end:\"2022-10-23T10:10:10\"}\n    }\n  ) \n  {\n    ts\n    sourceLocPop\n    requests\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAs queries também melhoram a organização das suas requisições e responses. Devido à habilidade de adaptação da GraphQL, você pode realizar diversas chamadas para a API e ainda assim receber apenas os dados que você solicitou através de um resultado no formato JSON.\n\nUsar a API GraphQL e seus recursos também melhoram seu desempenho.\n\n---\n\n## Operadores\n\nOperadores são chaves especiais que permitem que você personalize sua query para realizar desde comparações lógicas básicas até mais complexas. Você pode usar eles tanto para a Metrics GraphQL como para a Events GraphQL.\n\nDependendo do operador que você usar, você muda a condição que está consultando e recebe resultados diferentes. Os seguintes operadores podem ser utilizados com a GraphQL:\n\n| Chave | Descrição | Operador da GraphQL |\n| ----- | --------- | ------------------- |\n| eq | Consulta dados que são uma combinação exata do valor especificado. | `Eq` |\n| ne | Consulta dados que são diferentes do valor especificado. | `Ne` |\n| like | Consulta dados que são semelhantes ao valor especificado, considerando maiúsculas e minúsculas. | `Like` |\n| ilike | Consulta dados que são semelhantes ao valor especificado, sem considerar maiúsculas e minúsculas. | `Ilike` |\n| is_null | Consulta dados que são nulos ou não são nulos em relação ao valor especificado, usando `true` ou `false`. | `IsNull` |\n| in | Consulta dados que são parte de uma determinada lista de acordo com o valor especificado. | `In` |\n| not_in | Consulta dados que não estão contidos em uma determinada lista de acordo com o valor especificado. | `NotIn` |\n| lt | Consulta dados com valores menores do que o valor especificado. | `Lt` |\n| lte | Consulta dados com valores menores ou iguais ao valor especificado. | `Lte` |\n| gt | Consulta dados com valores maiores do que o valor especificado. | `Gt` |\n| gte | Consulta dados com valores maiores ou iguais ao valor especificado. | `Gte` |\n| range | Consulta dados que são parte de uma determinada faixa de valores de acordo com os valores especificados. | `Range` |\n\nSe você usar os operadores `Like` e `Ilike`, você também deve passar o identificador `%` dentro do campo na posição que desejar:\n\n| Posição do identificador | Descrição | Exemplo |\n| ------------------ | ----------- | -------- |\n| Fim | Qualquer string que começa com os caracteres. | \"Braz%\" |\n| Início | Qualquer string que termina com os caracteres. | \"%ao Paulo\" |\n| Fim e início | Qualquer string que contém os caracteres. | \"%ttp%\" |\n\nVeja exemplos de alguns campos com operadores:\n\n| Operador | Exemplo | Descrição |\n| -------- | ------- | --------- |\n| Eq | upstreamCacheStatusEq: \"HIT\" | Busca todos os dados que têm uma combinação exata com o valor `HIT` no campo upstreamCacheStatus. |\n| Ne | geolocCountryNameNe: \"Brazil\" | Busca todos os dados que não contêm `Brazil` no campo geolocCountryName. |\n| Like | hostLike: \"%mysite.com%\" | Busca todos os dados de hosts com o padrão `mysite.com`, *considerando maiúsculas e minúsculas*. |\n| Ilike | hostIlike: \"%mysite.com%\" | Busca todos os dados de hosts com o padrão `mysite.com`, *sem considerar maiúsculas e minúsculas*. |\n\nDependendo do [tipo de campo de um conjunto de dados](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/graphql-api-recursos/#queries-conjunto-dados) que você está consultando, você poderá usar operadores diferentes:\n\n| Tipo de campo | Possíveis operadores |\n| ------------- | -------------------- |\n| String | `Eq`, `Ne`, `Like`, `Ilike`, `In`, `NotIn`, `IsNull` |\n| Integer, Float, DateTime | `Eq`, `Lt`, `Lte`, `Gt`, `Gte`, `Ne`, `In`, `NotIn`, `IsNull`, `Range` |\n\n\n",

Assim, ao utilizar e combinar esses recursos disponíveis, o resultado será queries mais personalizadas e específicas. Dessa forma, as requisições buscam as informações exatas que você precisa.\n\nAs próximas seções detalham cada um dos recursos disponíveis na GraphQL e como eles podem ser utilizados.\n\n---\n\n## Conjuntos de dados\n\nA **API GraphQL** da Azion usa conjuntos de dados para indicar quais requisições você consegue executar através de queries e busca os dados do **Real-Time Metrics** e do **Real-Time Events**. Os conjuntos consistem de tabelas organizadas que trazem seus dados.\n\nVeja cada um dos conjuntos de dados disponíveis e o que eles buscam:\n\n| Dataset   | Description |\n|----------|-----------|\n| httpMetrics | Eventos de requisições registradas pelo [Edge Application](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/) e [Edge Firewall](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-firewall/).     |\n| l2CacheMetrics | Eventos de requisições registradas pelo [L2 Caching](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/edge-caching/#l2-caching).    |\n| edgeFunctionsMetrics | Eventos de execução do [Edge Functions](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/edge-functions/).     |\n| imagesProcessedMetrics |  Eventos de processamento de imagens do [Image Processor](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/image-processor/).    |\n| idnsQueriesMetrics | Eventos de consultas realizadas no [Intelligent DNS](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/intelligent-dns/).     |\n| dataStreamedMetrics | Registros de envio de dados do [Data Streaming](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/data-streaming/) para o endpoint do cliente.    |\n| httpEvents | Eventos de requisições registradas pelo [Edge Application](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/) e [Edge Firewall](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-firewall/)..     |\n| l2CacheEvents | Eventos de requisições registradas pelo [L2 Caching](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/edge-caching/#l2-caching).    |\n| edgeFunctionsEvents | Eventos de execução do [Edge Functions](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/edge-functions/).     |\n| imagesProcessedEvents |  Eventos de processamento de imagens do [Image Processor](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/image-processor/).    |\n| idnsQueriesEvents | Eventos de consultas realizadas no [Intelligent DNS](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/intelligent-dns/).     |\n| dataStreamedEvents | Registros de envio de dados do [Data Streaming](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/data-streaming/) para o endpoint do cliente.    |\n| cellsConsoleEvents |  Logs de eventos das aplicações usando o [Edge Runtime](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/edge-functions/runtime/visao-geral/) retornados pelo Cells Console.  |\n\nPara ver quais campos estão disponíveis em cada conjunto de dados de Metrics, leia a documentação [Campos Metrics GraphQL API](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/graphql-api/recursos/campos-metrics/). Você também pode rodar uma Introspection Query para consultar os metadados dos datasets de Metrics e Events. Veja mais no guia [Como consultar metadados com a API GraphQL](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/graphql-metadados/).\n\n> Veja mais sobre [Como realizar consultas de Queries Top X com a API GraphQL](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/graphql-query-top-x/).\n\nAo usar conjuntos de dados, é importante lembrar que você pode solicitar dados *raw* (*brutos*) ou *aggregated* (*agregados*). Ao solicitar informações de dados *raw*, usando os conjuntos Events, você recebe *dados brutos* relacionados ao conjunto específico sendo consultado. Ao solicitar informações de dados *aggregated*, usando os conjuntos Metrics, você recebe os dados relacionados ao conjunto específico sendo consultado em formato de *gráficos*.\n\nPara especificar que você quer agregar dados dentro de um intervalo de tempo, você deve adicionar o operador *aggregate* na sua query junto ao campo  `group_by`. A seguinte query, por exemplo, agrega dados:\n\n```graphql\nquery IdnsQuery {\n  idnsQueriesMetrics(\n    limit: 10\n    aggregate: {sum:requests}\n    groupBy: [ts]\n    filter: {\n      tsRange: {begin:\"2022-10-20T10:10:10\", end:\"2022-10-23T10:10:10\"}\n    }\n  ) \n  {\t\n    ts\n    sum\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> Veja mais sobre como agregar dados com o guia [Como realizar consultas agregando dados com a API GraphQL](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/graphql-dados-agregados/).\n\nTambém é importante observar que, com o *modelo de dados agregados*, você recebe dados de acordo com um intervalo de tempo definido através de um *adaptive resolver*. Atualmente, há três intervalos possíveis para buscar seus dados: *minuto*, *hora* e *dia*.\n\nCada intervalo relativo a uma query é utilizado de acordo com as seguintes definições:\n\n- **Minuto**: usado para queries com intervalo de **até 3 dias**.\n- **Hora**: usado para queries com intervalo entre **3 e 60 dias**.\n- **Dia**: usado para queries com intervalo **acima de 60 dias**.\n\nPara receber os seus dados, você deve informar um intervalo de tempo utilizando os campos `tsRange` ou `tsGt + tsLt` nas suas queries com formato válido de data e hora. Se você usar o `tsRange`, você receberá os dados dentro do período de tempo que foi informado, incluindo o início e o fim da data informada.\n\nUse o seguinte exemplo como base para utilizar o `tsRange` na sua requisição:\n\n```graphql\ntsRange: {begin:\"2022-06-23T09:10:10\", end:\"2022-06-23T16:10:10\"}\n```\n\nSe você usar o `tsGt + tsLt`, você receberá os dados dentro do período de tempo que foi informado, sem considerar o início e o fim da data informada.\n\nUse o seguinte exemplo como base para utilizar o `tsGt + tsLt` na sua requisição:\n\n```graphql\n{\n\n  \"tsGt\": \"2022-07-22T10:10:10\",\n\n  \"tsLt\": \"2022-09-19T10:10:10\"\n\n}\n```\n\nÉ importante definir e informar um intervalo de tempo em suas queries para que a **API GraphQL** consiga buscar os dados dos conjuntos de dados disponíveis e continue executando requisições com os demais recursos disponíveis.\n\n---\n\n## Filtrar\n\nAo usar o recurso de filtrar, o retorno das suas queries se torna mais específico e preciso, de acordo com os dados que você deseja buscar. É possível utilizar a filtragem com qualquer um dos campos disponíveis no conjunto de dados que você está consultando.\n\nAo solicitar dados complexos ou em grande quantidade, os retornos da API podem conter ruídos e se tornar mais complicados. Filtrar queries permite consultar os seus dados de forma exata e direta. Por exemplo, se você usar a seguinte query para uma requisição de `httpMetrics`:\n\n```graphql\nquery HttpQuery {\n  httpMetrics(\n    limit: 10\n    filter: {\n      tsRange: {begin:\"2022-10-20T10:10:10\", end:\"2022-10-23T10:10:10\"}\n    }\n  ) \n  {\t\n    ts\n    sourceLocPop\n  }\n}\n```\n\nVocê pode filtrar a query ao solicitar dados espeíficos sobre o campo `sourceLocPop`:\n\n```graphql\nquery HttpQuery {\n  httpMetrics(\n    limit: 10\n    filter: {\n      tsRange: {begin:\"2022-10-20T10:10:10\", end:\"2022-10-23T10:10:10\"}\n      sourceLocPop: \"lax-bso\"\n    }\n  ) \n  {\t\n    ts\n    sourceLocPop\n  }\n}\n```\n\nVocê pode ajustar a sua requisição conforme necessário para usar um campo de seu interesse, contanto que ele faça parte dos campos disponíveis no conjunto de dados que você está consultando naquele momento.\n\nVocê também pode filtrar usando múltiplos parâmetros `AND` e `OR`. Você deve definir todos os campos que deseja filtrar dentro do parâmetro, como no exemplo a seguir:\n\n```graphql\nquery totalImagesProcessedRequests {\n  imagesProcessedMetrics(\n    aggregate: {sum: requests}\n    limit: 100\n    filter: {\n      tsRange: {begin:\"2023-03-20T19:52:00\", end:\"2023-03-20T20:52:00\"}\n      or: {\n          status:304\n          statusRange: {begin: 200, end: 299}\n      }\n    }\n    groupBy:[ts]\n    orderBy:[ts_ASC]\n  )\n  {\n    ts\n    sum\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Ordenar\n\nO recurso ordenar permite que você organize e ordene os dados sendo recebidos de um conjunto de dados de acordo com a ordem daquele evento. Por exemplo, se você está recebendo dados do campo `host` como resposta para a sua requisição da API, você pode organizar esses dados para recebê-los:\n\n- Em *ordem ascendente (ASC)*\n- Em *ordem decrescente (DESC)*\n\nAo usar a propriedade `orderBy`, você deve adicionar ou a especificação `ASC` ou a especificação `DESC`.\n\nPor exemplo, para utilizar o recurso de ordenar através de ordem ascendente, você deve adicionar `orderBy` na sua query e o campo que você deseja ordenar + `ASC`:\n\n```graphql\n{\n    orderBy: [host_ASC]\n}\n```\n\nPara ordenar seus dados em *ordem decrescente (DESC)*, você deve adicionar o campo que deseja ordenar + `DESC`:\n\n```graphql\n{\n    orderBy: [ts_DESC]\n}\n```\n\nSe você usar esta query com `DESC`:\n\n```graphql\nquery SumBytesSentByHost {\n  httpMetrics(\n    limit: 1000\n    filter: {\n      tsRange: {begin:\"2023-01-01T17:03:00\", end:\"2023-06-01T18:05:00\"}\n    }\n    aggregate: {sum: bytesSent}\n    groupBy: [host]\n    orderBy: [sum_DESC]\n  ) \n  {        \n    host\n    sum\n  }\n}\n```\n\nVocê receberá uma resposta semelhante a:\n\n```graphql\n{\n    \"data\": {\n        \"httpMetrics\": [\n            {\n                \"host\": \"g1sdetynmxe0ao.map.azionedge.net\",\n                \"sum\": 606226\n            },\n            {\n                \"host\": \"uaykhefjdk9or.map.azionedge.net\",\n                \"sum\": 583059\n            },\n            {\n                \"host\": \"wz0ywpod397zk.map.azionedge.net\",\n                \"sum\": 567633\n            },\n            {\n                \"host\": \"zi1435nbhec7.map.azionedge.net\",\n                \"sum\": 96002\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\n```\n\nE se você usar esta query com `ASC`:\n\n```graphql\nquery AvgRequesTimeByHost {\n  httpMetrics(\n    limit: 1000\n    filter: {\n      tsRange: {begin:\"2023-01-01T17:03:00\", end:\"2023-06-01T18:05:00\"}\n    }\n    aggregate: {avg:requestTime}\n    groupBy: [ts, host]\n    orderBy: [avg_ASC]\n  ) \n  {        \n    ts\n    host\n    avg\n  }\n}\n```\n\nVocê receberá uma resposta semelhante a:\n\n```graphql\n{\n    \"data\": {\n        \"httpMetrics\": [\n            {\n                \"ts\": \"2023-04-21T00:00:00Z\",\n                \"host\": \"zipo145nbhc7.map.azionedge.net\",\n                \"avg\": 0.04871428571428572\n            },\n            {\n                \"ts\": \"2023-04-13T00:00:00Z\",\n                \"host\": \"g1snmxepa0ao.map.azionedge.net\",\n                \"avg\": 0.561\n            },\n            {\n                \"ts\": \"2023-04-11T00:00:00Z\",\n                \"host\": \"g1syinmxe2ao.map.azionedge.net\",\n                \"avg\": 4.101833333333333\n            },\n            {\n                \"ts\": \"2023-04-11T00:00:00Z\",\n                \"host\": \"wz1yd307zk.map.azionedge.net\",\n                \"avg\": 8.705666666666668\n            },\n            {\n                \"ts\": \"2023-05-22T00:00:00Z\",\n                \"host\": \"uaifjdk6or.map.azionedge.net\",\n                \"avg\": 31.493818181818185\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Paginar\n\nO recurso paginar permite definir a partir de que ponto você deseja que seus resultados sejam exibidos e quantos resultados você deseja visualizar. Atualmente, a **API GraphQL** da Azion usa *offset e limit pagination* para este recurso.\n\nPaginar seus dados pode ser vantajoso quando você recebe grandes quantidades de dados na resposta da API. Você pode utilizar o recurso informando o **offset** e os **limits**. Assim, a API consegue retornar dados dentro da variação solicitada.\n\nO parâmetro **offset** define o número de registros de dados que você deseja pular ao receber uma resposta. O parâmetro **limit** define o número de resultados que você deseja receber.\n\n> Definir os parâmetros offset e limit não é obrigatório. Se você não defini-los, a API GraphQL automaticamente define o **offset** para **0** e o **limit** para **10**.\n\nVeja o exemplo a seguir para entender o uso dos parâmetros offset e limit:\n\n```graphql\nquery HttpQuery {\n  httpMetrics(\n    offset: 15\n    limit: 30\n    filter: {\n      tsRange: {begin:\"2022-10-20T10:10:10\", end:\"2022-10-23T10:10:10\"}\n    }\n  ) \n  {\t\n    ts\n    sourceLocPop\n  }\n}\n```\n\nO offset está definido para 15, o que significa que a sua resposta exibirá a partir do 16º resultado. O limite está definido para 30, o que significa que a sua resposta exibirá um total de 30 resultados. Nesse caso, você receberá uma resposta exibindo do 16º resultado até o 45º resultado.\n\n> Se os seus dados são atualizados constantemente, o uso do recurso paginar pode resultar em falta ou duplicação de dados ao solicitar mais de uma requisição com o uso desse mesmo recurso.\n\n\n",

    "body": "\nA **Graphic Query Language (GraphQL)** é uma linguagem criada especificamente para uso com APIs. Ela funciona como uma alternativa às APIs REST, permitindo que você receba seus dados de acordo com suas necessidades. A GraphQL traz autonomia para que o usuário solicite os dados que deseja e receba exatamente o que foi solicitado através de uma resposta em JSON.\n\nA GraphQL busca dados de forma diferente das APIs tradicionais e permite filtrar dados sem precisar buscar quantidades desnecessárias de informações. As respostas precisas que ela fornece também proporcionam um melhor desempenho aos que usam a GraphQL, o que torna seu uso simples. Outra diferença da GraphQL comparada a outras APIs é que ela possui apenas um endpoint.\n\nVisando clientes que desejam solicitar e monitorar seus dados de forma fácil e eficaz, a Azion fornece suporte para a GraphQL. Você pode usar a API para aprimorar o uso de seus dados acessados pelo [Real-Time Metrics](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/real-time-metrics/), que fornece acesso em tempo real a métricas para que você possa otimizar o uso desses dados, e pelo [Real-Time Events](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/real-time-events/), que fornece dados em tempo real para você realizar pesquisas complexas para explorar suas informações.\n\nVocê também pode explorar os demais produtos de **Observe** da Azion: [Data Streaming](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/data-streaming/) e [Edge Pulse](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-pulse/).\n\nPara usar a GraphQL, você não precisa de banco de dados, framework ou linguagem de programação específicos. Você pode usá-la com o código e com os dados que você já utiliza normalmente. A API utiliza queries para acessar seus dados e informações e filtrar o que você precisa. Mesmo após fazer uma requisição, você pode modificar, deletar ou adicionar mais informações através de simples modificações na sua query.\n\nA seguir, veja o exemplo de uma query:\n\n```graphql\nquery HttpQuery {\n  httpMetrics(\n    filter: {\n      tsRange: {begin: \"2022-03-21T10:10:10\", end: \"2022-09-23T10:10:10\"}\n    }\n  ) \n  {\t\n    ts\n    geolocCountryName\n    geolocRegionName\n  }\n}\n```\n\nE um exemplo da resposta em formato JSON que será recebida:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"data\": {\n        \"httpMetrics\": [\n            {\n                \"ts\": \"2022-10-21T15:00:00Z\",\n                \"geolocCountryName\": \"Canada\",\n                \"geolocRegionName\": \"Quebec\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"ts\": \"2022-10-21T14:00:00Z\",\n                \"geolocCountryName\": \"Brazil\",\n                \"geolocRegionName\": \"Parana\"\n            }\n        ]\n    }\n}\n```\n\nAo utilizar queries na API GraphQL da Azion, você pode consultar dados *raw* (*brutos*) e *aggregated* (*agregados*). Se você utilizar dados agregados, a API busca seus dados de acordo com um intervalo pré-definido de *minutos*, *horas* ou *dias*.\n\n\n",

    "body": "\nO [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) pode ser usado em quase todas as tarefas que envolvem o entendimento ou a geração de linguagem natural ou código. No ambiente de desenvolvimento, é uma ferramenta usada para aumentar a produtividade dos desenvolvedores, ajudando-os a:\n\n- Explicar o código que está sendo implementado.\n- Gerar código.\n- Refatorar um código pré-existente.\n\n---\n\n## Como funciona a integração entre Edge Functions e o ChatGPT?\n\nO **Edge Functions Code Editor** é integrado às APIs do ChatGPT, para que você possa usar um conjunto de recursos dentro do editor, sem a necessidade de abrir outra guia. Os recursos vão desde refatorar o código até gerar um novo código com base na entrada informada pelo prompt.\n\nPrimeiro, é necessário configurar suas credenciais registradas na plataforma OpenAI e gerar uma chave de API e o ID da organização:\n\n- [Gerar chave da API ChatGPT](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)\n- [Gerar ID da organização do ChatGPT](https://platform.openai.com/account/org-settings)\n\nCom suas credenciais em mãos, cole-as em seu código-fonte como um comentário, como exemplificado abaixo:\n\n```js\n    /*\n    ChatGPTKey=key // Your ChatGPT key\n    ChatGPTOrg=org // The org\n    */\n```\n\nAgora, com suas credenciais definidas, você pode usar a integração para desenvolver mais rapidamente e ter seu código revisado sempre que quiser.\n\n---\n\n## Recursos\n\n### Explicação de código\n\nUm recurso disponível nesta integração é o **Code Explanation**. Ele se mostra útil quando você tem que depurar uma função, ou simplesmente revisá-la. Também é útil quando você está trabalhando em código legado.\n\n### Geração de código\n\nA Geração de Código funciona com base no prompt informado. Por exemplo, digamos que você queira retornar uma página `HTML`, com uma tabela contendo o nome, número de telefone e endereço.\n\n**Prompt**:\n\n```js\n    // generate an html table with name, phone number and address\n```\n\nDepois de escrever o prompt dentro do editor de código, clique com o botão direito e selecione `ChatGPT: Generate`\n\n**Saída**:\n\n```js\n    <body>\n     <table>\n       <thead>\n         <tr>\n           <th>Name</th>\n           <th>Phone Number</th>\n           <th>Address</th>\n         </tr>\n       </thead>\n       <tbody>\n         <tr>\n           <td>John Smith</td>\n           <td>(123) 456-7890</td>\n           <td>123 Main St, Anytown, USA</td>\n         </tr>\n         <tr>\n           <td>Jane Doe</td>\n           <td>(987) 654-3210</td>\n           <td>456 Oak St, Anytown, USA</td>\n         </tr>\n         <tr>\n           <td>Bob Johnson</td>\n           <td>(555) 555-1212</td>\n           <td>789 Maple St, Anytown, USA</td>\n         </tr>\n       </tbody>\n     </table>\n    </body>\n```\n\n### Refatoração de código\n\nOutra opção é pedir ao ChatGPT para refatorar o código. Para fazer isso, você deve selecionar o pedaço de código que você deseja ter refatorado, clicar com o botão direito sobre ele e selecionar `ChatGPT: Refactor`. Depois disso, seu código será refatorado automaticamente.\n\n**Dica**: é sempre uma boa ideia testar e garantir que o código refatorado esteja funcionando conforme o esperado, evitando problemas inesperados no futuro.\n\n---\n\n## Implementação\n\nVeja uma implementação da integração entre Edge Functions e o ChatGPT:\n\n| Implementação | Descrição |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Como criar uma API com Edge Functions e ChatGPT](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/edge-functions/api-builder/) | Veja como construir uma API e visualizar sua resposta em JSON no Azion Preview Provider, com o auxílio do ChatGPT |\n\n",

Acesse o [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/) com suas credenciais.\n2. No canto superior esquerdo, selecione **Products Menu** > **Observe** > **Data Streaming**.\n3. Selecione um template já existente ou crie um novo, clicando em **Add Streaming**.\n4. Preencha os campos abaixo com as informações necessárias:\n\n**Name for Data Streaming**: defina um nome para seu template.\n\n**Data**\n\n**Data Source**: é a plataforma Azion que gerará os eventos de onde você deseja coletar dados. Selecione uma opção.\n\n**Template**: definição das variáveis. Selecione **Custom Template** para criar uma nova configuração de dados e inclua as seguintes variáveis no campo **Data Set**:\n\n| Variável | Descrição |\n| --- | --- |\n| $time | Data e hora da requisição. |\n| $global_id | Identificador da configuração. |\n| $edge_function_id | Identificador da Edge Function. |\n| $request_id | Identificador da requisição. |\n| $log_level | Nível do log gerado (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE). |\n| $log_message | Mensagem usada para o log na chamada da função. |\n\n**Options**: local de onde será coletado dados. É possível filtrar os domínios (**Filter Domains**) ou selecionar todos (**All Domains**). Selecione uma opção.\n\n> Este campo aparecerá somente se você tiver mais de um domínio cadastrado.\n\n**Domains**: caso deseje especificar quais os domínios, selecione-os na caixa.\n\n**Sampling**: definição da % dos dados que serão transmitidos. So é permitido alterar o valor ao selecionar All Domains no campo Options.\n\n> Este campo aparecerá somente se você tiver mais de um domínio cadastrado.\n\n**Destination**\n\n**Endpoint type**: o método pelo qual seu endpoint vai receber os dados coletados por Data Streaming. Selecione uma opção.\n\n**Endpoint URL**: a URL que receberá as informações transmitidas por Data Streaming. Defina a URL.\n\n**Custom Headers**: inclua aqui a necessidade de adicionar headers nas requisições.\n\n5. Clique em **Save** para finalizar o processo.\n\nConsulte a [documentação do Data Streaming](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/data-streaming/) para mais informações.\n\n\n",

Elas são usadas para armazenar informações confidenciais ou definições de configuração que não devem ser codificadas na base de código.\n\n## Segurança\n\nUma das principais razões para usar variáveis de ambiente é aumentar a segurança do seu projeto. Informações confidenciais, como chaves de API, credenciais de banco de dados ou tokens de acesso, podem ser facilmente comprometidas se estiverem codificadas em sua base de código.\n\nAo usar variáveis de ambiente, você pode manter essas informações confidenciais separadas do código e limitar o acesso a indivíduos ou sistemas autorizados. Isso reduz o risco de exposição acidental ou acesso não autorizado a dados críticos.\n\n## Flexibilidade de configuração\n\nAs variáveis de ambiente permitem uma maior flexibilidade na configuração da sua aplicação. Em vez de modificar o código ou recompilar sua aplicação para atualizar as configurações, você pode simplesmente alterar os valores das variáveis de ambiente.\n\nIsso facilita a implantação de seu aplicativo em diferentes ambientes (desenvolvimento, staging, production) ou ao usar diferentes provedores (como plataformas em nuvem), pois cada ambiente pode ter seu próprio conjunto de variáveis.\n\n## Portabilidade\n\nAs variáveis de ambiente contribuem para a portabilidade do seu aplicativo. Ao abstrair os detalhes da configuração do código, você pode facilmente mover seu aplicativo entre diferentes ambientes ou plataformas sem modificar a base de código. Isso é particularmente útil ao dimensionar seu aplicativo ou implantá-lo em diferentes ambientes de hospedagem.\n\n## Colaboração\n\nAs variáveis de ambiente promovem a colaboração entre os membros da equipe. Como as informações confidenciais não são expostas diretamente na base de código, é mais seguro ter mais de um desenvolvedor trabalhando no mesmo projeto.\n\n## Controle da Versão\n\nAo excluir informações confidenciais da base de código, você pode evitar o envio de segredos para sistemas de controle de versão. Isso evita que segredos sejam vazados inadvertidamente ao compartilhar repositórios de código ou durante revisões de código. Em vez disso, apenas os modelos de configuração ou espaços reservados para variáveis de ambiente são comprometidos, garantindo a segurança de informações confidenciais.\n\n## Compliance\n\nEm muitos casos, as organizações precisam aderir aos padrões de conformidade que regulam o tratamento de dados confidenciais. Ao usar variáveis de ambiente, você pode atender a esses requisitos de conformidade, garantindo que as informações confidenciais sejam devidamente protegidas, controladas e auditáveis.\n\n---\n\n## Variáveis de ambiente na plataforma Azion\n\n### Azion API\n\nVocê pode gerenciar suas variáveis de ambiente através da [API da Azion](https://api.azion.com/)\n\n### Azion CLI\n\nO comando `variables` está disponível e pode ser usado para gerenciar suas variáveis de ambiente através da [Azion CLI](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/cli/variables/).\n\nSaiba mais sobre o comando em [comando variables e seus subcomandos](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/cli/variables/)\n\n---\n\n## Variáveis de ambiente e edge functions\n\nVocê pode recuperar o valor de sua variável de ambiente configurada dentro de uma edge function usando a interface`Azion.env.get ()`, passando sua chave. Exemplo:\n\n```javascript\n  const apiToken = Azion.env.get('API_SERVICE_TOKEN');\n```\n\nSaiba mais sobre a [interface de Variáveis de Ambiente](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/edge-functions/runtime/api-reference/metadata/).\n\n---\n\n## Limites\n\n| Escopo | Limitação | Descrição |\n| - | - | - |\n| Key | 100 por cliente | Cada conta pode ter no máximo 100 variáveis definidas. |\n| Value | 32 kB | O tamanho máximo de um valor é 32 kB. |",

Pode ser usado para resolver:\n\n- Routing\n- Data Fetching\n- Integrações\n\nCom o Next.js, você pode usar geração estática por página, utilizando **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**, sem ter que realizar o processo de `rebuild` na aplicação inteira. Isso significa que você pode aproveitar os benefícios da geração estática e ainda ser capaz de escalar a aplicação.\n\nUma **página**, em Next.js, é um **componente React** dentro de um arquivo. Esse arquivo utiliza uma das seguintes extensões:\n\n- `.js`\n- `.jsx`\n- `.ts`\n- `.tsx`\n\nToda página tem uma **rota** associada à ela, baseada no nome do arquivo.\n\n**Exemplo**:\n\nDigamos que você crie `pages/azion.js` exportando um React component.\n\n```js\n  export default function Azion() {\n    return <div>The easiest way to build, deploy, observe and secure modern applications.</div>\n  }\n```\n\nA página pode ser acessada em `/azion`:\n\n```js\npages/\n    azion.js\n```\n\n---\n\n## Pré-renderização \n\nCom o Next.js, o HTML de cada página é gerado com antecedência, desonerando o lado do cliente deste trabalho. Como consequência, essa pré-renderização ajuda sua aplicação a ter uma performance potencializada e também a ter melhores índices de Search Engine Optimization (SEO).\n\n### Formas de pré-renderização\n\n- Geração estática: durante o processo de `build`, o HTML é gerado e reutilizado em cada requisição.\n- Renderização do lado servidor: o HTML é gerado em cada requisição. \n\n### Static HTML Export\n\nVocê pode exportar a sua aplicação Next para [HTML estático] (https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/static-html-export), o qual não necessita de um servidor **Node.js** para ser renderizado.\n\nPara utilizar o `next export`, é preciso atualizar o script no arquivo `package.json` da aplicação:\n\n```json\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"build\": \"next build && next export\"\n  }\n```\n\nPara mais informações sobre o framework Next.js, leia a [documentação oficial](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started).\n\n---\n\n## Azion e Next.js\n\nPara criar uma aplicação em Next.js na plataforma da Azion, você precisa de:\n\n- Um bucket na Amazon Web Services (AWS) com permissões de escrita e leitura.\n- Uma conta na plataforma da Azion com o módulo **Edge Functions** habilitado.\n- o Node.js runtime environment, na versão 16.x ou superior, instalado.\n- A versão atual da [Azion CLI](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/cli/primeiros-passos/) instalada.\n\nVeja como ter um projeto Next.js rodando na plataforma da Azion em [Como criar e publicar um projeto Next.js com SSR na plataforma da Azion](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/nextjs-ssr-na-plataforma-azion/).\n\n**Nota**: atualmente, a plataforma da Azion suporta apenas HTML estático no `export` do Next.js.\n",

Novas possibilidades são desbloqueadas ao usar o preview, como:\n\n- Testar diferentes fluxos com base no método HTTP fornecido.\n- Ver o resultado de uma página HTML.\n- Retornar dados em JSON.\n\n---\n\n## Como funciona o Azion Preview Deployment?\n\nA implantação do Azion Preview depende de uma função auxiliar dentro do seu código-fonte. Essa função é chamada `PreviewProvider` e é responsável por depurar e simular uma requisição, retornando o resultado a ser renderizado. A função `PreviewProvider` é representada da seguinte maneira:\n\n```js\n    function PreviewProvider<PreviewProvider> (args) {\n        var request = new Request(\"https://azion.com/example\", {\n            method: \"GET\",\n            headers: {\n                \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n                \"Authorization\": \"Bearer my-token\"\n            },\n            redirect: \"follow\",\n        });\n        return handleRequest(request);\n    }\n```\n\n> **Observação**: sem a função `PreviewProvider`, não é possível ter o preview de sua função.\n\nAgora, com sua request simulada em execução, você pode definir comportamentos diferentes para sua função, com base em todas as propriedades disponíveis dentro da variável de request, como:\n\n```js\n    async function handleRequest(request){\n        switch (request.Method){\n            case ‘GET’:\n             return new Response(html,{\n                headers:{\n                    “content-type”:“text/html:charset=UTF-8\",\n                }\n             })\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nNeste trecho de código, é definido que, se uma solicitação `GET` for chamada, ela retornará a variável `HTML`, contendo o arquivo HTML a ser renderizado, e define também seu `content-type` conforme necessário para executar essa ação.\n\n### API Builder\n\nTambém é possível criar APIs e ter o resultado com base no método de solicitação. Por exemplo:\n\n- Você pode ter um objeto `JSON` como resposta, se a solicitação for um `POST`, alterando o header do `content-type` e retornando o objeto usando a função `JSON.stringify()`.\n- Caso a solicitação seja um `GET` e você deseje retornar uma página HTML, o `tipo de conteúdo` deve ser definido como `text/html:charset=UTF-8`. A resposta será apresentada já renderizada na pré-visualização.\n\nExemplo:\n\n```js\n    async function handleRequest(request){\n        switch (request.Method){\n            case ‘POST’:\n             return new Response(JSON.stringify(objectList),{\n                headers:{\n                    “content-type”:“application/json”,\n                }\n             })\n            case ‘GET’:\n             return new Response(html,{\n                headers:{\n                    “content-type”:“text/html:charset=UTF-8\",\n                }\n            })\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nA saída é mostrada ao lado do editor de código. Também é possível abri-la em uma guia diferente, clicando no botão **open**.\n\n## Azion Preview Provider e ChatGPT\n\nA integração com ChatGPT ajuda você a aumentar sua produtividade e, juntamente ao Azion Preview Deployment, permite implementações mais analíticas, possibilitando testar e ver novas ideias em tempo real.

    "body": "\n\n**Nota:** Azion Functions Runtime oferece a interface do módulo WebAssembly, conforme definido pela MDN. Você pode revisar a documentação diretamente no site da MDN [aqui](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WebAssembly).\n\n## 1. WebAssembly – Static methods\n\n#### **1.1.WebAssembly.compile()**\n\nA função `WebAssembly.compile()` compila o código binário WebAssembly.module em um objeto `WebAssembly.Module`. Esta função é útil se for necessário compilar um módulo antes que ele possa ser instanciado (caso contrário, a função `WebAssembly.instantiate()` deve ser usada).\n\n**Sintaxe**\n\n`WebAssembly.compile(bufferSource)`\n\n**Parâmetros**\n\n`bufferSource`\n\nUm typed array ou ArrayBuffer contendo o código binário do módulo .wasm que você deseja compilar.\n\n**Exemplo**\n\n```\nfetch('http://url/simple.wasm').then(response =>\n  response.arrayBuffer()\n).then(bytes =>\n  WebAssembly.compile(bytes)\n).then(mod =>\n  //your code here\n);\n```\n\n#### **1.2. WebAssembly.compileStreaming()**\n\nA função `WebAssembly.compileStreaming()` compila um `WebAssembly.Module` fdiretamente de uma fonte subjacente transmitida. Esta função é útil se for necessário compilar um módulo antes que ele possa ser instanciado (caso contrário, a função `WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming()` deve ser usada).\n\n**Sintaxe**\n\n`WebAssembly.compileStreaming (source)`\n\n**Parâmetros**\n\n`source`\n\nUm objeto `Response`, representando a origem subjacente de um módulo .wasm que você deseja transmitir e compilar.\n\n**Exemplo**\n\n```\nvar importObject = { imports: { imported_func: arg => console.log(arg) } };\n\nWebAssembly.compileStreaming(fetch('http://url/simple.wasm'))\n.then(module => WebAssembly.instantiate(module, importObject))\n.then(instance => instance.exports.exported_func());\n```\n\n#### **1.3. WebAssembly.instantiate()**\n\nUma função `WebAssembly.instantiate()` permite compilar e instanciar código WebAssembly. Esta função tem dois overloads:\n\n- O overload primário usa o código binário do WebAssembly, na forma de uma typed array ou `ArrayBuffer`, e executa a compilação e a instanciação em uma única etapa;\n- O overload secundário usa um `WebAssembly.Module` já compilado e retorna uma `Promise`que resolve para uma `Instance`desse `Module`. \n\n**Sintaxe** (overload primário)\n\n`WebAssembly.instantiate(bufferSource, importObject);`\n\n**Parâmetros**\n\n`bufferSource`\n\nUm typed array ou `ArrayBuffer` contendo o código binário do módulo .wasm que você deseja compilar.\n\n`importObject` (opcional)\n\nUm objeto contendo os valores a serem importados para a `Instance` recém criada, tais como funções ou objetos `WebAssembly.Memory`. Deve haver uma propriedade correspondente para cada importação declarada do módulo compilado ou então um `WebAssembly.LinkError` é apresentado.\n\n**Exemplo**\n\n```\nvar importObject = {\n  imports: {\n    imported_func: function(arg) {\n      console.log(arg);\n    }\n  }\n};\n\nfetch('http://url/simple.wasm').then(response =>\n  response.arrayBuffer()\n).then(bytes =>\n  WebAssembly.instantiate(bytes, importObject)\n).then(result =>\n  result.instance.exports.exported_func()\n);\n```\n\n**Sintaxe** (overload secundário)\n\n`WebAssembly.instantiate(module, importObject);`\n\n**Parâmetros**\n\n`module`\n\nO objeto `WebAssembly.Module` a ser instanciado.\n\n`importObject` (opcional)\n\nUm objeto contendo os valores a serem importados para a `Instance` recém criada, tais como funções ou objetos `WebAssembly.Memory`. Deve haver uma propriedade correspondente para cada importação declarada do módulo compilado ou então um `WebAssembly.LinkError` é apresentado.\n\n**Exemplo**\n\n```\nWebAssembly.compileStreaming(fetch('http://url/simple.wasm'))\n.then(module => WebAssembly.instantiate(module))\n.then(instance => instance.exports.exported_func());\n```\n\n#### **1.4. WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming()**\n\nA função `WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming()` compila e instancia um módulo WebAssembly diretamente de uma fonte subjacente transmitida. Essa é a maneira mais eficiente e otimizada de carregar o código wasm.\n\n**Sintaxe**\n\n`WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(source, importObject)`\n\n**Parâmetros**\n\n`source`\n\nUm objeto `Response` ou uma promessa que será cumprida com um, representando a fonte subjacente de um módulo .wasm que você deseja transmitir, compilar e instanciar.\n\n`importObject` (opcional)\n\nAn object containing the values to be imported into the newly-created Instance, such as functions or WebAssembly.Memory objects. There must be one matching property for each declared import of the compiled module or else a WebAssembly.LinkError is thrown.\n\nUm objeto contendo os valores a serem importados para a `Instance` recém criada, tais como funções ou objetos `WebAssembly.Memory`. Deve haver uma propriedade correspondente para cada importação declarada do módulo compilado ou então um `WebAssembly.LinkError` é apresentado.\n\n**Exemplo**\n\n```\nvar importObject = { imports: { imported_func: arg => console.log(arg) } };\n\nWebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch('http://url/simple.wasm'), importObject)\n.then(obj => obj.instance.exports.exported_func());\n```\n\n#### **1.5. WebAssembly.validate()**\n\nA função `WebAssembly.validate()` valida um determinado typed array de código binário WebAssembly, retornando se os bytes formam um módulo wasm válido ( `true`) ou não ( `false`).\n\n**Sintaxe**\n\n`WebAssembly.validate(bufferSource)`\n\n**Parâmetros**\n\n`bufferSource`\n\nUm typed array ou ArrayBuffer contendo código binário WebAssembly a ser validado.\n\n**Exemplo**\n\n```\nfetch('http://url/simple.wasm').then(response =>\n  response.arrayBuffer()\n).then(function(bytes) {\n  const valid = WebAssembly.validate(bytes);\n  console.log(\"The given bytes are \"\n    + (valid ? \"\" : \"not \") + \"a valid wasm module\");\n});\n```\n\n\n\n## 2. WebAssembly - Constructor properties\n\n#### **2.1.

Isso pode ter um valor de \"anyfunc\" (funções) ou \"externref\" (referências de host).\n\n- `initial`\n\n  O número inicial de elementos da WebAssembly Table.\n\n- `maximum opcional`\n\n  O número máximo de elementos a que a WebAssembly Table é permitida expandir.\n\n**Example**\n\n```\nvar tbl = new WebAssembly.Table({initial:2, element:\"anyfunc\"});\nvar len = tbl.length;  // \"2\"\nvar v1 = tbl.get(0);  // \"null\"\nvar v2 = tbl.get(1);  // \"null\"\n\n// Creating an import object that contains the table\nvar importObj = {\n  js: {\n    tbl:tbl\n  }\n};\n```\n\n#### **2.8. WebAssembly.Tag() constructor**\n\nO `WebAssembly.Tag()` cria um novo objeto `WebAssembly.Tag`.\n\n**Sintaxe**\n\n`new WebAssembly.Tag(type)`\n\n**Parâmetros**\n\n`type`\n\nUm objeto que pode conter os seguintes elementos:\n\n- `parameters`\n\n  Um array de tipos de dados(\"i32\", \"i64\", \"f32\", \"f64\", \"v128\", \"externref\", \"anyfunc\").\n\n**Exceções**\n\n`TypeError`\n\nO argumento `type.parameters` não é fornecido, não contém pelo menos um valor ou contém um descritor de tag não suportado.\n\n**Exemplo**\n\nIsso cria uma tag com dois valores:\n\n```\nconst tag = new WebAssembly.Tag({ parameters: [\"i32\", \"i64\"] });\n```\n\n#### **2.9. WebAssembly.Exception constructor**\n\nO `WebAssembly.Exception()` é usado para criar um novo `WebAssembly.Exception`.\n\nO construtor aceita um argumento Tag e um payload array de campos de dados. Os tipos de dados de cada um dos elementos de payload devem corresponder ao tipo de dados correspondente especificado na Tag.\n\nO construtor também pode receber um `options`objeto. A `options.traceStack`propriedade pode ser definida como true (por padrão é `false`) para indicar que o código WebAssembly que lança a exceção pode preencher a `stack`propriedade da exceção com uma stack track.\n\n**Sintaxe**\n\n`new Exception(tag, payload, options)`\n\n**Parâmetros**\n\n`tag`\n\nUma `WebAssembly.Tag` definição dos tipos de dados esperados para cada um dos valores no arquivo `payload`.\n\n`payload`\n\nUm array de um ou mais campos de dados compreendendo a carga útil da exceção. Os elementos devem corresponder aos tipos de dados dos elementos correspondentes no arquivo `tag`. Se o número de campos de dados na carga útil e seus tipos não corresponderem, uma `TypeError`exceção será lançada.\n\n`options` (opcional)\n\nUm objeto com os seguintes campos opcionais:\n\n`traceStack` (opcional)\n\n`true`se o `Exception`pode ter um rastreamento de pilha anexado à sua `stack`propriedade, caso contrário `false`. Isso é `false`por padrão (se `options`ou `options.traceStack`não for fornecido).\n\n**Exceções**\n\n`TypeError`\n\nAs sequências `payload` e `tag` não têm o mesmo número de elementos e/ou os elementos não são de tipos correspondentes.\n\n**Exemplo**\n\n```\n// Create tag and use it to create an exception\nconst tag = new WebAssembly.Tag({ parameters: [\"i32\", \"f32\"] });\nconst exception = new WebAssembly.Exception(tag, [42, 42.3]);\n```\n\n\n",

O Azion Edge Runtime possibilita a criação de [edge functions](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/edge-functions/) em JavaScript, construídas sobre os padrões da Web.\n\nAs **edge functions** auxiliam na implementação de regras de negócio e na criação de aplicações *serverless* no edge, mais perto do usuário.\n\nCom o Azion Edge Runtime, você pode usar uma lista de **Web APIs**, como por exemplo:\n\n- Network\n- Encoding and Decoding\n- Web Streams\n- Standards\n- V8 Primitives\n\n## Jamstack\n\n[Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) é uma abordagem que separa os dados e regras de negócio da camada de experiência da web, melhorando a flexibilidade, escalabilidade, performance e manutenção.\n\nVocê pode experienciar a abordagem arquitetural **Jamstack** fazendo deploy de uma aplicação na plataforma de Edge da Azion utilizando:\n\n- [Next.js](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/edge-functions/runtime-api/frameworks-suportados/nextjs/)\n\n## Strict mode\n\nA Azion faz do modo estrito (strict mode) a opção padrão e obrigatória para a verificação de tipos de código JavaScript. A equipe principal da Azion defende veementemente o modo estrito como a escolha sensata padrão. Esse modo capacita os desenvolvedores com recursos essenciais do JavaScript que idealmente deveriam ter sido disponibilizados desde o início. No entanto, à medida que o JavaScript evoluiu ao longo do tempo, incorporar esses recursos teria introduzido breaking changes nas bases de códigos existentes.\n\nO `strict mode` faz várias alterações na semântica normal do JavaScript:\n\n- Elimina alguns erros silenciosos do JavaScript, transformando-os em erros a serem lançados.\n- Corrige erros que dificultam a otimização dos motores JavaScript: o código em modo estrito pode ser executado mais rapidamente do que um código idêntico que não está em modo estrito.\n- Proíbe algumas sintaxes que provavelmente serão definidas em futuras versões do ECMAScript.\n\nSaiba mais sobre o [Strict mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode).\n\n",

Para isso, você precisa:\n\n- Escolher um dos templates disponíveis na **CLI**:\n  - Next.js\n  - Static\n  - CDN\n- Inicializar um projeto **JavaScript** com o **Node.js** runtime environment.\n\n### Uso\n\n```bash\n    azioncli edge_applications init\n```\n\n### Flags\n\n#### Name\n\nA opção `--name` pode ser especificada, mas não é obrigatória. Caso não seja informada, o nome do seu projeto será o mesmo que está definido no `package.json` do projeto.\n\n#### Type\n\nA opção `--type` pode ser especificada, mas não é obrigatória. Caso não seja informada, o tipo do projeto será autodetectado.\n\nAtualmente, a CLI tem três templates disponíveis, e o tipo `cdn` para o desenvolvimento de uma edge application que seguem `--type`:\n\n- Static\n\n```bash\n    azioncli edge_applications init --name <\"application_name\"> --type static\n```\n\n- Next.js\n\n```bash\n    azioncli edge_applications init --name <\"application_name\"> --type nextjs\n```\n\n- CDN\n\n```bash\n    azioncli edge_applications init --name <\"application_name\"> --type cdn\n```\n\nCaso não exista o arquivo de configuração `package.json` no diretório de sua aplicação, a CLI retornará a seguinte mensagem de erro: \n\n```bash \n    Error: Failed to find package.json in current directory. Verify if you are currently in your project's directory\n```\n\nNesse caso, crie o arquivo de configuração `package.json` no mesmo repositório que se encontra sua aplicação. Então, rode novamente o comando `--init` para inicializar a aplicação.\n\n> **Dica**: a melhor solução para a criação do arquivo `package.json` é inicializar um projeto **Node.js** no diretório da aplicação. Para fazer isso, use o comando do Node.js runtime environment: \n>\n> `npm init -y`\n\nResposta do comando no terminal:\n\n```bash\n    Wrote to /Users/<user_name>/web-app-proj/package.json:\n\n    {\n    \"name\": \"web-app-proj\",\n    \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n    \"description\": \"\",\n    \"main\": \"index.js\",\n    \"scripts\": {\n        \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\"\n    },\n    \"keywords\": [],\n    \"author\": \"\",\n    \"license\": \"ISC\"\n    }\n```\n\n#### No\n\nA opção `--no` força a resposta 'no' para todos inputs do usuário.\n\n#### Yes\n\nA opção `--yes` força a resposta 'yes' para todos inputs do usuário.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Construindo\n\nO segundo passo na criação de uma edge application é a construção baseada nos atributos que foram passados no comando `init`. O comando usado na construção da aplicação é o `build`.\n\n### Uso\n\n```bash\n    azioncli edge_applications build\n```\n\n### Flags\n\n#### Help\n\nA única flag disponível para o comando `build` é `--help`, que mostra uma breve tela de ajuda.\n\n**Nota**: uma necessidade para o uso do comando `build` é a presença do framework **Webpack** instalado em seu computador.\n\n---\n\n## Publicando\n\nO passo final na criação de uma edge application é a publicação da mesma na plataforma da Azion. O comando `publish` realiza essa tarefa automaticamente.\n\n### Uso\n\n```bash\n    azioncli edge_applications publish\n```\n\n### Flags\n\n#### Help\n\nA única flag disponível para o comando `publish` é `--help`, que mostra uma breve tela de ajuda.\n\n**Nota**: a publicação de uma edge application via Real-Time Manager (RTM) ou CLI não é um processo instantâneo. É necessário um tempo para a propagação e configuração da aplicação nos pontos de edge da Azion. Pode ser necessário alguns minutos para que a URL seja ativada e a aplicação possa ser visualizada no navegador. \n\n---\n\n## Descrevendo\n\nO subcomando `describe` mostra informações sobre uma edge application específica, baseado no ID que é passado, apresentando seus atributos detalhados.\n\n### Uso\n\n```bash\n    azioncli edge_applications describe --application-id 4312\n    azioncli edge_applications describe --application-id 1337 --out \"./tmp/test.json\" --format json\n    azioncli edge_applications describe --application-id 1337 --format json\n```\n\n### Flags\n\n#### Application ID\n\nO `--application-id` é o identificador único de sua edge application.\n\n#### Format\n\nA opção `--format` altera o formato do output, passando o valor `json` pela flag.\n\n#### Help\n\nA opção `--help` mostra mais informações sobre o subcomando.\n\n#### Out\n\nA opção `--out` exporta o output para o `<file_path/file_name.ext>` informado.\n\n---\n\n## Deletando\n\nO comando `delete` é usado para excluir uma edge application.\n\n### Uso\n\n```bash\n    azioncli edge_applications delete --application-id 1234\n```\n\n### Flags \n\n#### Application ID\n\nA opção `--application-id` é o identificador único de uma edge application.\n\n#### Help\n\nA opção `--help` mostra mais informações sobre o subcomando.\n\n---\n\n## Listando\n\nO comando `list` é utilizado quando for preciso listar suas edge applications.\n\n### Uso\n\n```bash\n    azioncli edge_applications list\n```\n\n### Flags\n\n#### Details\n\nA opção `--details` mostra todos os campos relevantes de suas edge applications.\n\n#### Filter\n\nA opção `--filter` filtra as aplicações pelo nome.\n\n#### Help\n\nA opção `--help` mostra mais informações sobre o comando.\n\n#### Order by\n\nA opção `--order_by` ordena a saída baseando-se nos campos selecionados.\n\n#### Page\n\nA opção `--page` retorna uma página da lista respeitando o seu número. O valor padrão é `1`.\n\n#### Page size\n\nA opção `--page_size` define quantos itens devem ser retornados por página. O valor padrão é `10`.\n\n#### Sort\n\nA opção `--sort` define a ordem que as aplicações serão mostradas na lista. As opções são `<asc|desc>`. \n\n---\n\n\n\n",

Através da **Azion CLI**, você pode criar e gerenciar serviços como **Edge Functions** e **Edge Services**, bem como provisionar aplicações **Next.js**.\n\nVisite o site do framework [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) para maiores informações.\n\nCom a **Azion CLI**, você pode:\n\n- Gerenciar produtos da Azion.\n- Criar automações utilizando scripts ou pipelines de CI/CD (Integração Contínua/Entrega Contínua).\n- Provisionar múltiplos serviços para compor a sua aplicação com poucos comandos.\n- Gerenciar suas configurações da Azion como código.\n\nPara uma visualização geral dos comandos da **CLI**, você pode acessar a [documentação de referência](https://github.com/aziontech/azion-cli/wiki/azioncli).\n\n> A **Azion CLI** está atualmente em fase **Beta**. Algumas funcionalidades podem ser modificadas até o seu lançamento. Portanto, use-a com cautela em ambientes de produção. Enquanto você experimenta a versão **Beta**, nossa equipe de engenharia adoraria ouvir a sua opinião a fim de aprimorá-la. Contribua com o seu [feedback](https://forms.gle/uBBkyXZCVcrgpvAB8).\n\n## Sobre as Interfaces de Linha de Comando\n\nAntes do desenvolvimento das **Interfaces Gráficas do Usuário** (GUI), desenvolvedores de software e usuários interagiam com os computadores utilizando um teclado e um monitor, conhecidos como **terminal**.\n\nO teclado servia como dispositivo de entrada, no qual o usuário digitava linhas de comando. O computador então processava o comando e apresentava o resultado na tela do monitor, eventualmente com alguma mensagem adicional.\n\nOs comandos digitados no teclado seguiam regras que permitiam criar uma interface entre o usuário e o computador, normalmente compostas de uma palavra-chave, sinalizadores, e parâmetros. Essa interface, utilizada até hoje, é a **Interface de Linha de Comando** ou **CLI**.\n\nPosteriormente, as **GUIs** atraíram para o mundo dos computadores os usuários que consideravam a digitação de comandos complexa e desafiadora. Entretanto, a **CLI** nunca perdeu a sua importância, especialmente no ambiente de desenvolvimento de software.\n\nNa realidade, a **CLI** possui muitas vantagens quando comparada com o uso de interfaces gráficas, como por exemplo:\n\n- Possibilidade de manipular recursos do computador inacessíveis pelas GUI.\n- Rapidez e simplicidade para executar tarefas.\n- Flexibilidade na criação de scripts para automação de processos.\n\nTodos os sistemas operacionais modernos possuem aplicativos do tipo terminal, no qual o usuário pode digitar linhas de comando a fim de executar tarefas no computador.\n\n\n",

Você pode aplicar essas regras a uma aplicação dinâmica usando o [Rules Engine](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/rules-engine/).\n\n> Se você quiser definir configurações de cache para conteúdo estático, consulte o guia [Como configurar políticas de cache para Edge Application](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/edge-caching/).\n\nPara ativar a **Advanced Cache Key** para uma edge application:\n\n1. Acesse o [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).\n2. No canto superior esquerdo da página, selecione o **Products menu**, representado por três linhas horizontais.\n3. Na seção **BUILD**, clique em **Edge Application**.\n4. Selecione a edge application que deseja configurar ou [crie uma nova](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/ponto-de-partida/).\n5. Na aba **Main settings**, na seção **Modules**, ative a opção **Application Acceleration**.\n6. Clique no botão **Save**.\n\n---\n\n## Criando regras avançadas de cache para conteúdo dinâmico com base em Query Strings\n\nPara ilustrar melhor o uso da **Advanced Cache Key** com base em Query Strings, suponha que sua aplicação tem a seguinte URL: `dominio.com/pagina?cidade=nome_cidade`.\n\nA URI `/pagina` tem uma API, chamada pela Query String `?cidade=nome_cidade`, que lista o conteúdo dependendo da cidade do usuário. O conteúdo da página é atualizado automaticamente a cada cinco minutos.\n\nPara combinar o TTL do cache com o tempo de atualização do conteúdo chamado pelo campo `cidade`:\n\n1. Acesse o [RTM](https://manager.azion.com/).\n2. No canto superior esquerdo da página, selecione o **Products menu**, representado por três linhas horizontais.\n3. Na seção **BUILD**, clique em **Edge Application**.\n4. Selecione a aplicação e verifique se o **Application Acceleration** está ativo.\n5. Clique na guia **Cache Settings**.\n6. Clique no botão **Add Cache Settings** e dê à sua configuração um nome fácil de lembrar.\n7. Tanto na seção **Browser Cache Settings** quanto em **CDN Cache Settings**:\n   - Marque a opção **Override Cache Settings**.\n   - Defina o **Maximum TTL (seconds)** para `300` (5 minutos).\n8. Na seção **Advanced Cache Key**, defina seu **Cache by Query String** da seguinte forma:\n   - Selecione a opção **Content varies by some Query String fields (Whitelist)**.\n   - Nos **Query String fields**, insira o valor `cidade`.\n9. Clique no botão **Save**.\n\nAgora, há um objeto de política de cache com a Query String `cidade` que pode ser ativado no **Rules Engine** da seguinte forma:\n\n1. Clique na aba **Rules Engine**.\n2. Clique no botão **New Rule** e selecione **Request Phase**.\n3. Na seção **Criteria**, defina os critérios que acionam o comportamento sempre que o URI `/pagina` for acessado da seguinte forma:\n\n   > If `${uri}` *starts with* `/pagina`\n\n4. Na seção **Behaviors**:\n   - Selecione o comportamento **Set Cache Policy**.\n   - Selecione a configuração de cache que você criou para a Query String `cidade`.\n5. Clique no botão **Save**.\n\nPronto. Agora o conteúdo será armazenado em cache no navegador e na origem pelo mesmo tempo que a API leva para atualizar sua aplicação.\n\n---\n\n## Criando regras avançadas de cache para conteúdo dinâmico com base em Cookies\n\nSe sua aplicação usa autenticação baseada em cookies, você pode usar a **Advanced Cache Key** para garantir que o conteúdo em cache varie de acordo com cada cookie de sessão.\n\nPor exemplo, cada vez que um usuário faz login em sua conta em uma edge application, ele é direcionado para uma página `/perfil`. O conteúdo da página de perfil do usuário deve variar dependendo de um cookie chamado `session_cookie` que passa a ter um valor após um login bem-sucedido.\n\nPara garantir que todos os usuários vejam uma página diferente dependendo do cookie de sessão:\n\n1. Acesse o [RTM](https://manager.azion.com/).\n2. No canto superior esquerdo da página, selecione o **Products menu**, representado por três linhas horizontais.\n3. Na seção **BUILD**, clique em **Edge Application**.\n4. Selecione a aplicação e verifique se o **Application Acceleration** está ativo.\n5. Clique na guia **Cache Settings**.\n6. Clique no botão **Add Cache Settings** e dê à sua configuração um nome fácil de lembrar.\n7. Configure **Browser Cache Settings** e **CDN Cache Settings** conforme desejado.\n8. Na seção **Advanced Cache Key**, defina seu **Cache by Cookie** da seguinte forma:\n   - Selecione a opção **Content varies by some Cookies**.\n   - Em **Cookie nomes**, insira o valor `session_cookie`.\n9. Clique no botão **Save**.\n\nO próximo passo é ativar uma regra no **Rules Engine** para a página `/perfil` da seguinte forma:\n\n1. Clique na aba **Rules Engine**.\n2. Clique no botão **New Rule** e selecione **Request Phase**.\n3. Na seção **Criteria**, defina os critérios que acionam o comportamento sempre que a URI `/perfil` for acessada da seguinte forma:\n\n   > If `${uri}` *starts with* `/perfil`\n\n4. Na seção **Behaviors**:\n   - Selecione o comportamento **Set Cache Policy**.\n   - Selecione a configuração de cache que você criou para o `session_cookie`.\n5. Clique no botão **Save**.\n\nPronto. Agora o objeto em cache para a página de perfil irá variar com base no cookie de sessão do usuário.\n\n\n",

Ele permite criar listas personalizadas (Network Lists) baseadas em endereços de IP, ASN e geolocalização do usuário ou utilizar listas automáticas mantidas e atualizadas pela Azion, como a lista de endereços da rede Tor.\n\nCom isso, é possível monitorar comportamentos suspeitos, criar regras inteligentes e aplicar penalizações contra ações maliciosas, bloqueando ou limitando acesso, provisionando proteção no Edge para a camada de rede do tráfego de entrada e saída em suas aplicações.\n\nAlgumas outras vantagens de utilizar o serviço Network Layer Protection da Azion:\n\n* facilidade de integração com SIEM ou outras ferramentas de segurança em sua infraestrutura utilizando APIs para manutenção de blocklists;\n* processamento no Edge em real-time, preservando o desempenho da infraestrutura de origem;\n* possibilidade de executar regras de negócio no Edge.\n\n## Como funciona\n\nO serviço Network Layer Protection utiliza uma série de listas mantidas pelo próprio usuário ou pela Azion, que podem ser atualizadas manualmente ou via API. Quando uma requisição chegar a um Edge Node da Azion, ela é avaliada e, caso atenda aos critérios definidos no Rule Set daquele Edge, é realizada uma consulta às listas configuradas, filtrando assim agentes ofensores conhecidos antes mesmo que a requisição chegue à infraestrutura do cliente.\n\nAo ativar o módulo dentro de um Edge Firewall, as condições (Criterias) _Network_ e os comportamentos (Behaviors) _Deny_, _Drop_ e _Set Rate Limit_ passam a ficar disponíveis na configuração de Rules Engine da Rule Set selecionada. Isso permite ao cliente definir em quais condições as listas serão consultadas e quais comportamentos deverão ser executados.\n\n## Habilitando o módulo Network Layer Protection\n\nPara habilitar o módulo Network Layer Protection, basta acessar o Edge Firewall desejado pelo Real-Time Manager (RTM), a partir do menu Edge Computing, e ativar o serviço na aba Mains Settings.\n\nDepois de habilitado, é necessário criar as listas personalizadas e definir os critérios de avaliação e comportamentos que serão aplicados pelo Edge Firewall.\n\n## Criando uma Network List\n\n**Caminho:** Real-Time Manager > Edge Libraries > Network Lists\n\nAo acessar a página de Network Lists, serão exibidas todas as listas criadas pelo usuário e os itens fornecidos automaticamente pela Azion, como [Origin Shield](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-firewall/network-layer-protection/#origin-shield) (necessário contato com equipe comercial para liberação de acesso ao serviço).\n\nPara criar uma nova, clique no botão _Add_, escolha um nome intuitivo para sua lista (_BlockedIPsList_, por exemplo, para configurar uma lista de IPs ofensores conhecidos), selecione o _Type_ desejado, preencha a lista conforme o tipo escolhido (_ASN_, _Countries_ ou _IP/CIDR_) e clique em _Save_. Para nosso exemplo, utilizaremos a opção IP/CIDR). Uma lista de usuário pode ser atualizada a qualquer momento, de forma manual ou via integração por API.\n\n    123.456.789.1\n    123.456.789.2/32\n    10.1.1.0/16\n\nExemplo de configuração de uma lista do tipo IP/CIDR.\n\n## Definindo critérios de execução (Rules Engine)\n\n**Caminho:** Real-Time Manager > Edge Computing > Edge Firewall > Rules Engine\n\nCrie um novo Rule Set dentro de seu Edge Firewall ou edite algum já existente. As regras (ou Rule Engines) determinam o conjunto de condições que precisam ser atendidas para a execução dos Behaviors. Você deve criar uma nova regra a fim de configurar os parâmetros de validação e os comportamentos para execução de sua Rule Set pelo Edge Firewall.\n\n**Definindo critérios de validação (criteria):** escolha as variáveis, operadores de comparação e strings para a construção de sua regra de negócio, como no exemplo a seguir:\n\n* **If**: _Network_ **matches** _BadBotsList_\n  (na sequência: operador lógico, variável, operador de comparação, string)\n\nAqui, a regra é executada se o endereço IP da requisição estiver presente na lista _BadBotsList_ criada anteriormente.\n\n**Definindo comportamentos (_behaviors_):** adicione os comportamentos que deseja executar caso as condições da regra sejam satisfeitas. Exemplo:\n\n* **Then**: _Drop (Close Without Response)_\n  (na sequência: operador lógico, ação)\n\nNesse exemplo, se as condições definidas nas regras forem satisfeitas, será executado um Drop na requisição sem enviar retorno para o requisitante.\n\nPor fim, salve o seu Rule Set e seu Edge Firewall já estará pronto para executar a nova regra.\n\n\n",

    "body": "\nNeste guia, serão apresentadas as etapas para a criação de uma edge application usando os comandos da **Azion CLI**.\n\n**Requisitos**:\nAntes de iniciar a construção da sua edge application, você precisa:\n\n- Baixar e instalar o **Node.js** JavaScript runtime compatível com o seu sistema operacional a partir do [site oficial](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Essa instalação inclui o gerenciador de pacotes `npm`.\n- Baixar e instalar a Azion CLI, versão `0.46.0` ou superior, conforme apresentado no tópico [Instalação](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/cli/primeiros-passos/#instalacao).\n- Criar um *personal token* no **RTM** e configurá-lo na **CLI**. Veja o tópico [Autorização na Plataforma da Azion](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/cli/primeiros-passos/#autorizacao).\n\nPara criar uma edge application usando a CLI com o template JavaScript, siga os seguintes passos:\n\n1. Inicialize um projeto Node.js na pasta da aplicação com o comando `npm init -y`.\n2. Crie um arquivo denominado `index.js` com o código da aplicação.\n3. Execute o comando:\n\n    `azioncli edge_applications init --name \"my-app\" --type javascript`\n\n4. Execute o comando:\n\n    `azioncli edge_applications build`\n\n5. Execute o comando:\n\n    `azioncli edge_applications publish`\n\nA resposta da CLI será *semelhante* ao exemplo abaixo:\n\n        Building your edge application\n\n        Your edge application was built successfully\n        Created Edge Function my-app with ID 1909\n        Created Edge Application my-app with ID 123456789\n        Created Domain my-app with ID 123456789\n        Your edge application was published successfully\n\n        To visualize your application access the domain: xxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net\n\n        Content is being propagated to all Azion POPs and it might take a few minutes for all edges to be up to date\n\n6. Utilize a URL que aparece no final da mensagem do passo 5 para abrir a sua edge application no seu navegador de Internet.\n\n> **Nota**: a publicação de uma edge application pelo RTM ou pela CLI não é um processo instantâneo. Existe um tempo de propagação e configuração da aplicação nos pontos de edge da Azion. Pode ser necessário aguardar alguns minutos para a ativação da URL e a efetiva visualização da página da aplicação no navegador.\n\n[Navegue pelo RTM](https://manager.azion.com/) para visualizar os novos elementos que os comandos da CLI criaram neste guia.\n\n> **Dica**: para recuperar a URL da sua aplicação, acesse o **Products Menu** > **Domains** no RTM. Você verá uma lista dos seus domínios, inclusive aquele criado pelos comandos da CLI.\n\n\n",

É normal que uma edge application utilize várias funções.\n\n---\n\nPara os exemplos a seguir, é necessário que você:\n\n- Instale a **Azion CLI**.\n- Crie ou utilize um *Personal Token* que o identifique na plataforma da Azion.\n\n---\n\nInicialmente, você pode listar as edge functions disponíveis em sua biblioteca, incluindo a função pré-configurada `Azion - Hello World`.\n\nPara listar as suas edge functions, execute o comando abaixo:\n\n```bash\n    azioncli edge_functions list\n```\n\nUma lista com as suas funções será exibida no terminal, como neste exemplo:\n\n```bash\n    ID      NAME                   LANGUAGE      ACTIVE\n    3976    Azion - Hello World    javascript    true\n    6598    func01                 javascript    true\n```\n\nO comando `azioncli edge_functions list` responde com uma tabela composta por quatro colunas:\n\n- **ID**: identificador único da **Edge Function** na Azion.\n- **NAME**: nome da função.\n- **LANGUAGE**: linguagem de programação ou framework da função.\n- **ACTIVE**: status da função, podendo ser ativo (**true**) ou inativo (**false**).\n\n---\n\nAgora, crie uma nova edge function diretamente pela **CLI**, sem precisar recorrer ao **RTM**.\n\nInicialmente, vamos precisar de um arquivo **JavaScript** contendo o código-fonte da função. Caso você não tenha um arquivo no diretório atual, crie um com o comando abaixo:\n\n```bash\n    echo \"alert('My new JavaScript function');\" > my-func.js\n```\n\nDepois de executar o comando, verifique a criação do arquivo `my-func.js` com o comando `ls`.\n\nAgora que você já tem um arquivo com a função **JavaScript**, poderá criar a sua edge function com ele. Para isso, digite o comando abaixo:\n\n```bash\n    azioncli edge_functions create --name my-new-ef --code ./my-func.js --active true\n```\n\nResposta da CLI:\n\n```bash\n    Created Edge Function with ID 6823\n```\n\nA CLI responde com o **ID** da nova função criada. Para verificar, vamos utilizar novamente o comando *list*:\n\n```bash\n    azioncli edge_functions list\n```\n\nResposta da CLI:\n\n```bash\n    ID      NAME                   LANGUAGE      ACTIVE\n    3976    Azion - Hello World    javascript    true\n    6598    func01                 javascript    true\n    6823    my-new-ef              javascript    true\n```\n\nEm relação à lista do exemplo anterior, desta vez o comando *list* incluiu a função `my-new-ef` com o ID *6823*, criada pelo comando **create**.\n\n---\n\nVocê pode excluir a função recém-criada `my-new-ef`. Para isso, execute o comando *delete* com o parâmetro *ID* da função:\n\n```bash\n    azioncli edge_functions delete --function-id 6823\n```\n\nResposta da **CLI**:\n\n```bash\n    Edge Function 6823 was successfully deleted\n```\n\nExecute novamente o comando **list**. A CLI apresentará a seguinte tabela:\n\n```bash\n    ID      NAME                   LANGUAGE      ACTIVE\n    3976    Azion - Hello World    javascript    true\n    6598    func01                 javascript    true\n```\n\nNote que a função `my-new-ef`, cujo ID era *6823*, não aparece mais na lista. Você pode acessar o **RTM** para analisar os resultados dos comandos da CLI apresentados neste exemplo.\n\n---\n\n\n",

Crie uma pasta no sistema de arquivos do seu computador na qual deseja executar os comandos da **CLI**; por exemplo: `my-cli`.\n\n> **Dica**: você pode criar uma pasta em seu sistema de arquivos usando o terminal. Execute o comando `mkdir my-cli`, no qual `my-cli` é o nome da pasta.\n\n2. Faça o download do binário da arquitetura desejada, cujas plataformas compatíveis estão listadas abaixo.\n\nO arquivo binário `azioncli` é baixado na pasta `Downloads` do sistema de arquivos do computador.\n\n| Sistema Operacional | Arquitetura | URL da Azion CLI |\n| --------------------- | ----------- | -------- |\n| macOS | x86_64 | [https://downloads.azion.com/darwin/x86_64/azioncli](https://downloads.azion.com/darwin/x86_64/azioncli) |\n| macOS | ARM64 | [https://downloads.azion.com/darwin/arm64/azioncli](https://downloads.azion.com/darwin/arm64/azioncli) |\n| FreeBSD&reg; <sup>7</sup> | x86_64 | [https://downloads.azion.com/freebsd/x86_64/azioncli](https://downloads.azion.com/freebsd/x86_64/azioncli) |\n| FreeBSD | ARM64 | [https://downloads.azion.com/freebsd/arm64/azioncli](https://downloads.azion.com/freebsd/arm64/azioncli) |\n| Linux&reg; <sup>8</sup>   | x86_32 | [https://downloads.azion.com/linux/x86_32/azioncli](https://downloads.azion.com/linux/x86_32/azioncli) |\n| Linux | x86_64 | [https://downloads.azion.com/linux/x86_64/azioncli](https://downloads.azion.com/linux/x86_64/azioncli) |\n| Linux | ARM32 | [https://downloads.azion.com/linux/arm32/azioncli](https://downloads.azion.com/linux/arm32/azioncli) |\n| Linux | ARM64 | [https://downloads.azion.com/linux/arm64/azioncli](https://downloads.azion.com/linux/arm64/azioncli) |\n\nComo alternativa, você pode fazer o download via linha de comando. No exemplo abaixo, o link é referente à arquitetura *Linux/x86_64*. Caso utilize outra versão, basta alterar a URL para o sistema operacional ou arquitetura desejada com o comando abaixo:\n\n    `curl -O https://downloads.azion.com/linux/x86_64/azioncli`\n\n3. Copie o arquivo `azioncli`, baixado no passo anterior, para a pasta criada no passo 1 com o gerenciador de arquivos do seu sistema operacional.\n4. Abra o terminal e mude o diretório de trabalho para a pasta que você criou no passo 1 executando o comando `cd <path>` com o caminho da pasta `my-cli` no seu computador.\n5. Confirme a existência do arquivo binário `azioncli` na pasta do projeto com o comando `ls`.\n\nResposta no terminal:\n\n    `azioncli`\n\n6. Conceda permissão para execução do binário `azioncli` no seu computador com o seguinte comando:\n\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`chmod +x azioncli`\n\nSe o terminal não apresentar nenhuma mensagem, o comando foi executado sem erros.\n\n> **Nota**: caso o seu computador utilize o sistema operacional macOS, ele apresentará uma janela com uma mensagem de erro impedindo a execução da CLI. Veja o procedimento para [liberar a execução da CLI no sistema operacional macOS](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/cli-executando-macos/).\n\n7. Execute o comando:\n\n> **Nota**: o comando abaixo permite que você execute a `azioncli` a partir de qualquer pasta do sistema de arquivos do seu computador. Você poderá, então, apagar os arquivos `azioncli` no diretório do seu projeto e da pasta `Downloads`, executando o comando `rm azioncli` nos respectivos diretórios.\n\n    `sudo cp azioncli /usr/local/bin`\n\nO comando acima é *opcional*. Caso você não queira executar o comando `sudo cp azioncli /usr/local/bin`, lembre-se de ter uma cópia do binário `azioncli` na pasta do seu projeto e executá-la com os caracteres `./` na frente, como em `./azioncli <command>`. Caso contrário, uma mensagem de erro será apresentada informando que o comando `azioncli` não foi encontrado.\n\nO comando `sudo` pede a senha do usuário com permissões de administrador do computador. Digite a sua senha e pressione a tecla **ENTER** ou **RETURN**. Os caracteres não são exibidos durante a digitação.\n\n8. Teste a execução da **CLI** com o comando a seguir; uma tela de ajuda será apresentada no terminal.\n\n    `azioncli --help`\n\nCaso uma janela com uma mensagem de alerta seja exibida na tela, informando que o desenvolvedor não pode ser identificado, clique no botão **Cancelar**. O terminal responde com a seguinte mensagem:\n\n    `zsh: killed     azioncli --help`\n\nEm seguida, siga os passos da documentação [Execução da CLI no Sistema Operacional macOS](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/cli-executando-macos/). Após liberar a execução, execute novamente o comando `azioncli --help` ou `azioncli --version` para verificar se a Azion CLI está funcionando normalmente.\n\nNo caso do comando `azioncli --version`, a resposta deverá ser semelhante a apresentada abaixo, ou uma versão superior:\n\n    `azioncli version 0.46.0`\n\n> **Nota**: o processo de liberação da execução da CLI apresentado acima é referente ao sistema operacional macOS. Caso utilize outro sistema operacional, siga os procedimentos previstos na documentação do sistema.\n\nA partir de agora, você já pode executar comandos da CLI. Para auxiliá-lo, ela possui um sistema interativo e integrado de ajuda com o propósito de facilitar a sua utilização.\n\n\n",

The content of a static page is predefined and remains the same for all users\n                  who\n                  visit the page. It's typically created using HTML, CSS, and sometimes JavaScript.</p>\n              <p>Static pages are suitable for displaying information that doesn't need to be frequently updated or\n                  personalized. They are easy to create and host since they consist of simple HTML files that can be\n                  served\n                  directly by a web server without the need for server-side processing or a database.</p>\n              <p>On the other hand, a non-static or dynamic web page is generated on the server-side or client-side in\n                  real-time in response to user requests or events. The content of a dynamic page can vary based on\n                  factors\n                  such as user input, database records, session information, or external data sources.</p>\n              <p>Dynamic pages often utilize server-side programming languages like PHP, Python, or JavaScript (Node.js)\n                  to\n                  generate the HTML dynamically. They can fetch data from databases, perform calculations, process user\n                  input, and generate personalized content on the fly. Dynamic pages enable interactive and personalized\n                  web\n                  experiences, such as social media feeds, e-commerce sites, web applications, and more.</p>\n              <p>In summary, the main difference between static and dynamic pages is that static pages have fixed content\n                  and\n                  require manual updates, while dynamic pages are generated on-the-fly and can provide personalized and\n                  interactive content based on various factors.</p>\n          </article>\n      </div>\n\n      <footer class=\"footer\">\n          <a href=\"https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/cli/\" target=\"_blank\">Azion CLI Documentation</a>\n      </footer>\n  </body>\n\n  </html>\n```\n\n\n\n2.

Como alternativa, você pode navegar pelos templates pré-configurados no RTM escolhendo um na lista suspensa **Template** e copiar as variáveis que quer usar.\n\nVeja um exemplo de custom template para o data source **Edge Applications**. O template pré-configurado atual possui cerca de 50 variáveis, mas você pode querer usar apenas 10 variáveis na sua análise de dados.\n\nAssim, você pode adicionar as variáveis que deseja usar na caixa de código **Data Set**:\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"time\": \"$time\",\n    \"session_id\": \"$session_id\",\n    \"host\": \"$host\",\n    \"status\": \"$status\",\n    \"bytes_sent\": \"$bytes_sent\",\n    \"upstream_bytes_received\": \"$upstream_bytes_received\",\n    \"server_port\": \"$server_port\",\n    \"remote_port\": \"$remote_port\",\n    \"country\": \"$country\",\n    \"state\": \"$state\"\n}\n```\n\nApós adicionar as variáveis que você escolheu:\n\n1. Preencha os campos obrigatórios restantes para configurar seu data streaming.\n2. Confira se a opção **Active** está ligada, indicada pelo switch de alternância com cor laranja.\n3.

Crie [uma conta na Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/).\n2. Crie [um projeto](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project) na Google Cloud Platform. O **Project ID** será dado enquanto você o cria, salve-o para usar depois.\n3. Crie uma [service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create) na Google Platform.\n4. A service account deve possuir as permissões de **BigQuery Admin**. Selecione essa opção no menu suspenso do campo **Role**.\n\n> Para mais detalhes sobre as permissões padrões atribuídas à função do editor de dados BigQuery, acesse [BigQuery Roles](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#bigquery-roles).\n\nVocê também precisa criar e salvar as seguintes informações:\n\n- Habilitar a BigQuery API\n- Um dataset\n- Uma service account key\n\n### Habilitar BigQuery API\n\nAgora, você deve acessar o [API ⁠Manager](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library) e habilitar a BigQuery API.\n\nA BigQuery API tem suporte a um endpoint para transmitir linhas em uma tabela. No entanto, esse endpoint não é suportado na versão *Free Tier*. Para utilizá-lo, é necessário habilitar a versão completa da plataforma com a configuração de faturamento (billing).\n\nVeja mais detalhes sobre esse passo na [documentação de gerenciamento de faturamento de projetos](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project). As taxas de utilização da API podem ser consultadas na tabela de preços na seção **Streaming Inserts**.\n\n### Criar dataset\n\nApós habilitar a API, você precisa criar um dataset. Para isso, você precisa criar um projeto no [console da Google Cloud](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery).

    "body": "\nO Azion **Edge Application** pode manter seu conteúdo armazenado em cache no edge para sustentar altos níveis de demanda sem comprometer a qualidade ou o desempenho. Isto resulta em uma melhor experiência do usuário, tempos de carregamento mais rápidos e custos de manutenção mais baixos.\n\nVocê pode otimizar seus tempos de processamento definindo o time-to-live (TTL) para conteúdo estático armazenado em cache na origem ou no navegador do usuário final, ou ignorar as configurações de cache de origem com o [Rules Engine](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/rules-engine/).\n\n> Para configurar políticas de cache para conteúdo dinâmico, consulte o guia [Como configurar a Advanced Cache Key para Edge Application](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/desempenho-apis-sites-application-acceleration/).\n\n## Criando e aplicando uma política de cache para o Edge Application\n\nPara personalizar políticas de cache, primeiro você deve habilitar o módulo de **Application Acceleration**. Isso ampliará os recursos do **Rules Engine** e também irá permitir que você possa alterar o TTL de cache da CDN para valores abaixo de 60 segundos.\n\nPara habilitar o Application Acceleration, siga os passos:\n\n1. Acesse o [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com).\n2. No canto superior esquerdo da página, selecione o **Products menu**, representado por três linhas horizontais.\n3. Na seção **BUILD**, clique em **Edge Application**.\n4. Selecione a aplicação que deseja configurar ou [crie uma nova](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/ponto-de-partida/).\n5. Na aba **Main Settings**, na seção **Modules**, ative a opção **Application Acceleration**.\n6. Clique no botão **Save**.\n\nAgora é hora de criar uma configuração de cache e personalizar as políticas de cache. É nesse ponto em que você define quanto tempo deseja que seu conteúdo estático permaneça no cache.\n\nPara criar uma configuração de cache, siga as etapas:\n\n1. Navegue até a guia **Cache Settings** da sua aplicação.\n2. Clique no botão **Add Cache Settings**.\n3. Dê um nome fácil de lembrar para sua configuração de cache. Por exemplo: `/target-uri - Cache TTL`.\n4. Em **Expiration Settings**, você pode personalizar o TTL do seu cache da seguinte maneira:\n   - Em **Browser Cache Settings**, selecione **Override Cache Settings** para definir por quanto tempo seu conteúdo pode ser armazenado em cache nos navegadores.\n   - Em **CDN Cache Settings**, selecione **Override Cache Settings** para definir por quanto tempo seu conteúdo pode ser armazenado em cache na edge.\n5. Se você optou por substituir as configurações de cache, adicione o **TTL máximo** desejado em segundos.\n   - Nesse momento, você também pode personalizar configurações de cache para conteúdo dinâmico relacionadas à funcionalidade [Advanced Cache Key](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/application-acceleration/#advanced-cache-key).\n6. Clique no botão **Save**.\n\nEm seguida, você deve criar uma regra para aplicar a configuração de cache que você criou. Para isso, siga os passos abaixo:\n\n1. Navegue para a aba **Rules Engine** de sua aplicação.\n2. Clique no botão **New Rule** e selecione  **Request Phase**.\n3. Dê um nome fácil de lembrar para sua regra.\n4. Na seção **Criteria**, você pode definir a condição para aplicar a configuração de cache. Por exemplo, para aplicar sua configuração a uma URI específica:\n\n   > If `${uri}` *starts with* `/target-uri`\n\n5. Na seção **Behavior**, selecione o comportamento **Set Cache Policy**.\n6. No novo campo, selecione a configuração `/target-uri - Cache TTL`.\n7. Clique no botão **Save**.\n\nPronto. As configurações de cache que você criou agora serão aplicadas à condição definida nos critérios. Você pode personalizar a regra ainda mais para atender às necessidades de negócios de sua aplicação.\n\n---\n\n## Criando uma regra para ignorar o cache da origem\n\nSe você quiser ignorar as políticas de cache de origem, você pode criar uma regra da seguinte forma:\n\n1. Com o módulo **Application Acceleration** ativo, navegue para a aba **Rules Engine** de sua aplicação.\n2. Clique no botão **New Rule** e selecione **Request Phase**.\n3. Dê um nome fácil de lembrar para sua regra. Por exemplo: `/target-uri - Bypass Cache`.\n4. Na seção **Criteria**, você pode definir a condição para ignorar cache. Por exemplo, para ignorar cache de uma URI específica:\n\n   > If `${uri}` *starts with* `/target-uri`\n\n5. Na seção **Behavior**, selecione o comportamento **Bypass Cache**.\n6. Clique no botão **Save**.\n\nNote que a funcionalidade de ignorar cache afeta apenas políticas de cache da origem, não políticas de cache do navegador. Para isso, você deve aplicar o comportamento **Set Cache Policy** descrito acima.\n\n> Consulte a documentação sobre [Bypass Cache](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/application-acceleration/#bypass-cache) para saber mais sobre a diferença entre esse comportamento e TTL zero.\n\n---\n\n## Criando uma regra para enviar cookies da origem ao usuário\n\nSe você deseja enviar os conteúdos do cabeçalho `Set-Cookie` ao usuário, você poderá criar a seguinte regra:\n\n1. Navegue para a aba **Rules Engine** de sua aplicação.\n2. Clique no botão **New Rule** e selecione **Response Phase**.\n3. Dê um nome fácil de lembrar para sua regra. Por exemplo: `/target-uri - Forward Cookies`.\n4. Na seção **Criteria**, você pode definir a condição para enviar os cookies. Por exemplo, para enviar os cookies de uma URI específica:\n\n    > If `${uri}` *starts with* `/target-uri`\n\n5. Na seção **Behavior**, selecione o comportamento **Forward Cookies**.\n6. Clique no botão **Save**.\n\n> Para enviar cookies do usuário para a origem, você pode criar a mesma regra na **Request phase**.\n\nNote que cookies de sessão podem estar inclusos no comportamento **Forward Cookies**. Para prevenir que usuários recebam cookies de seções privadas:\n\n1. Navegue para a aba **Cache Settings** tab.\n2. Crie uma nova configuração de cache clicando no botão **Add Cache Settings**.\n3. Dê um nome fácil de lembrar para sua configuração. Por exemplo: `/target-uri - Private cookies`.\n4. Na seção **Advanced Cache Key**, em **Cache by Cookie**, selecione a opção **Content varies by cookies, except for a few**.\n5. Liste todos os cookies da seção que deseja manter privada.\n6. Clique no botão **Save**.\n\nPor fim, para ativar a configuração de cache com os cookies privados que você listou para a página `/target-uri`:\n\n1. Navegue para a aba **Rules Engine**.\n2. Selecione a regra `/target-uri - Forward Cookies` que você criou nos passos anteriores.\n3. Na seção **Behavior**, clique no botão **+ Behavior**.\n4. Selecione o comportamento **Set Cache Policy**.\n5. No campo de argumentos, selecione a configuração `/target-uri - Private cookies`.\n6. Clique no botão **Save**.\n\nVocê também pode combinar essa funcionalidade com o comportamento **Bypass Cache** descrito na seção anterior.\n\n\n",

    "body": "\nPara empresas de serviços on-line, como e-commerces, internet banking e mídia, investir em soluções de segurança é tão importante quanto investir no desenvolvimento de novos aplicativos, sites ou APIs de integração. Todos os dias, novas ameaças são descobertas e, para se proteger das ações de cibercriminosos, é necessária a atualização constante das políticas de segurança e adoção de ferramentas para proteção, como por exemplo o firewall.\n\nO alto custo para manter um ambiente capaz de suportar um grande volume de requisições e, ao mesmo tempo, protegido contra ameaças externas, pode inviabilizar a expansão dos negócios. Além disso, por mais imprescindíveis que sejam, as soluções de segurança tradicionais podem acarretar em perda de desempenho por consumir recursos importantes de infraestrutura. Soluções de Edge computing, com processamento em real-time, são o caminho para garantir a segurança e o desempenho das suas aplicações a um custo acessível.\n\n## Segurança em Real-Time com Edge Computing\n\nO _Azion Edge Firewall_ é uma plataforma de segurança multicamadas que oferece soluções de Edge Computing para manter suas aplicações, APIs e websites mais seguros. Executadas diretamente no edge da rede, nossas soluções altamente escaláveis estão preparadas para responder em real-time contra ameaças _OWASP_ top 10, ataques massivos (_DoS_ e _DDoS_) e até mesmo ataques _zero-day_ sem que o desempenho de seus serviços seja impactado.\n\nVeja como as soluções do Azion Edge Firewall podem ajudar você:\n\n* **_Network Layer Protection_**: construa um perímetro de segurança em torno do seu conteúdo, aplicações web e infraestrutura de origem. Proteja-se contra vazamentos de dados capazes de gerar enormes prejuízos financeiros e danos à reputação de sua empresa, barrando ações maliciosas por meio de regras inteligentes que incluem bloqueio de rede (black e white lists de endereços IP, números ASN, países ou regiões), limite de taxa de transferência e muito mais.\n* **_Web Application Firewall_** (WAF): crie regras altamente customizadas, com atualizações de configuração em tempo real, para proteger qualquer tipo de aplicação web, como e-commerce, CMS ou internet banking, contra as ameaças Top 10 da OWASP, incluindo ataques críticos à camada de aplicação, como SQL Injection, ou ainda ações de ameaças novas e em evolução;\n* **_DDoS Protection_**: o DDoS Protection da Azion abrange a nossa rede global distribuída e expertise em segurança, providenciando a inteligência e capacidade das quais você precisa para mitigar os maiores e mais complexos ataques, tanto na camada de rede, quanto na de aplicação;\n* **_Edge Functions_**: crie e configure funções de segurança como ReCaptcha, JWT, Web Token, Bot Protection, entre outras, e proteja informações importantes para sua estratégia competitiva, como preço e conteúdo, de ações maliciosas que consomem banda, aumentam o tráfego e comprometem as aplicações, além de prejudicar seu ranking de SEO.\n\n## Como funciona\n\nAntes de começar, certifique-se de que o serviço _Edge Firewall_ e seus módulos estão ativos em sua conta da Azion. Caso não estejam, entre em contato com nosso time comercial para habilitar os serviços.\n\nPara ilustrar o funcionamento, utilizaremos como exemplo a configuração de um _Edge Firewall_ para uma loja de e-commerce (domínio _www.myecommerce.com_, que deve ser pré-configurado dentro de uma _Edge Application_), onde iremos impedir que um determinado site malicioso faça redirecionamentos para nossa loja. Para tanto, configuraremos dentro do _Edge Firewall_ uma regra de bloqueio por _Header HTTP Referer_.\n\nDentro do _Real-Time Manager_, crie uma nova configuração de _Edge Firewall_ ou edite uma existente. Na aba _Mains Settings_, será necessário habilitar o nosso domínio www.myecommerce.com para que ele possa ser protegido pela regra. Salve sua rule set, e em seguida adicione uma \"New Rule* na aba _Rules Engine_. Escolha um nome para sua \"Rule Engine\" e defina os critérios de ativação (Criteria). Para o nosso exemplo, vamos utilizar a variável _Header Referer_, o operador \"matches\" e, na string de comparação, um endereço fictício de um site malicioso http://www.malicioussite.com.\n\nEm seguida, basta configurar em \"Behavior\" uma ação para nossa regra e, nesse caso, utilizaremos a opção _Deny (403 Forbidden)_. Com isso, fica estabelecido uma regra em que toda requisição à nossa loja que for originada do site http://www.malicioussite.com será bloqueada e retornará um status code HTTP 403.\n\nPara desfrutar de todos os recursos que o Azion _Edge Firewall_ oferece, habilite dentro do seu _Edge Firewall_, na aba Main Settings, todos os módulos que desejar através do Real-Time Manager. Entre em contato com nosso time de Solutions para mais detalhes.\n\n\n",

    "body": "\nSaiba mais sobre o processo necessário para criar uma API com [Edge Functions](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/edge-functions/) e [ChatGPT](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/edge-functions/runtime-api/ai-integration/), e tenha a resposta apresentada no [Azion Preview Deployment](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/edge-functions/runtime-api/preview-deployment/).\n\nPara fazer isso, você precisa ter:\n\n- Registro [na OpenAI](https://chat.openai.com/).\n- [Sua OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).\n- [Sua OpenAI organization ID](https://platform.openai.com/account/org-settings).\n\nPara começar a criar sua API, proceda da seguinte forma:\n\n1. No [Real-Time Manager RTM](https://manager.azion.com/), no canto superior esquerdo, selecione **Edge Functions** na seção **Edge Libraries**.\n2. Clique em **Add a Function**.\n3. Escolha um nome para sua função.\n4. Exclua a função predefinida que está dentro do editor de código.\n5. Adicione sua OpenAI API key e organization ID ao código, como um comentário:\n\n```js\n    /*\n    ChatGPTKey=sk-xxxxxxx\n    ChatGPTOrg=org-xxxxxx\n    */\n```\n\n> **Nota**: o preview apresentará um aviso mencionando a necessidade de ter a função `PreviewProvider` dentro do código. Não se preocupe, esta situação será coberta nos próximos passos.\n\n\n\n6. Copie e cole a seguinte `const`:\n\n```js\n    const html = `<!DOCTYPE html>\n    <body>\n      <h1>Hello World</h1>\n      <p>This markup was generated by Azion - Edge Functions.</p>\n    </body>`\n```\n\n\n\n7. Escreva o seguinte prompt dentro da função, logo abaixo das credenciais OpenAI que foram coladas na etapa 5:\n\n```js\n    // generate an object with 5 properties being 2 of them array of objects\n```\n\n\n\n8. Selecione o prompt > clique nele com o botão direito do mouse > escolha **ChatGPT: Generate**. Aguarde alguns segundos até carregar.\n\nO resultado esperado será semelhante a:\n\n```js\n    let myObject = {\n        property_1: 'value_1',\n        property_2: 10,\n        property_3: true,\n        property_4: [{object_1: 'value_1'}, {object_2: 'value_2'}],\n        property_5: [{object_3: 'value_3'}, {object_4: 'value_4'}]\n    };\n```\n\n\n\n9. Adicione a função `handleRequest`, contendo um `switch case`, com um método `GET` e um método `POST`:\n\n```js\nasync function handleRequest(request) {\n  switch (request.method) {\n    case 'POST':\n      return new Response(JSON.stringify(myObject), { // Returning the object generated by ChatGPT\n        headers: {\n          \"content-type\": \"application/json\",// Altering the content-type to application/json\n        }\n      })\n    case 'GET':\n      return new Response(html, {\n        headers: {\n          \"content-type\": \"text/html:charset=UTF-8\",\n        }\n      })\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- O método `POST` retorna um objeto `JSON`, que foi gerado pela opção `ChatGPT: Generate`.\n- O método `GET` retorna a `const html` que foi declarada na etapa 6.\n\n\n\n10. Copie e cole a função `PreviewProvider`, responsável por simular solicitações:\n\n```js\n    function PreviewProvider(args) {\n      var request = {\n        body: {},\n        headers: {},\n        method: \"GET\",\n        redirect: \"\",\n      }\n      return handleRequest(request)\n    }\n```\n\n\n\n11. Adicione a função `addEventListener`, que aciona todo o processamento da edge function:\n\n```js\n    addEventListener(\"fetch\", event => {\n            return event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))\n          })\n```\n\n\n\n12. Clique com o botão direito em qualquer lugar dentro do editor de código e selecione **Format document**.\n\nNeste ponto, sua edge function deve estar semelhante a:\n\n```js\n\n    /*\n    ChatGPTKey=sk-xxxxxxx\n    ChatGPTOrg=org-xxxxxx\n    */\n    const html = `<!DOCTYPE html>\n    <body>\n      <h1>Hello World</h1>\n      <p>This markup was generated by Azion - Edge Functions.</p>\n    </body>`\n\n    let myObject = {\n            property_1: 'value_1',\n            property_2: 10,\n            property_3: true,\n            property_4: [{object_1: 'value_1'}, {object_2: 'value_2'}],\n            property_5: [{object_3: 'value_3'}, {object_4: 'value_4'}]\n        };\n\n    async function handleRequest(request) {\n      switch (request.method) {\n        case 'POST':\n          return new Response(JSON.stringify(myObject), { // Returning the object generated by ChatGPT\n            headers: {\n              \"content-type\": \"application/json\",// Altering the content-type to application/json\n            }\n          })\n        case 'GET':\n          return new Response(html, {\n            headers: {\n              \"content-type\": \"text/html:charset=UTF-8\",\n            }\n          })\n      }\n    }\n\n     function PreviewProvider(args) {\n      var request = {\n        body: {},\n        headers: {},\n        method: \"GET\", //or POST\n        redirect: \"\",\n      }\n      return handleRequest(request)\n    }\n\n      addEventListener(\"fetch\", event => {\n        return event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))\n      })\n```\n\nSe quiser, você pode alternar o método dentro da função `PreviewProvider` e ter uma visualização em tempo real das respostas no [Azion Preview Deployment](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/edge-functions/runtime-api/preview-deployment/).\n\n\n\n13. Clique no botão **Save**.\n\nAgora, a função está pronta para ser instanciada em uma edge application.

No entanto, uma política de CORS pode bloquear a requisição de um recurso localizado em um domínio a partir de um outro domínio.\n\nPara resolver esse erro, vamos utilizar o seguinte exemplo para guiar o passo a passo:\n\nDomínios:\n\n- `http://a.domain.com/` (origem)\n- `http://b.domain.com/` (destino)\n\nMensagem de erro:\n\nAccess to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://a.domain.com/page-cors-subdomain-a.txt' from origin 'http://b.domain.com' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.\n\nPara resolver esse tipo de erro, você precisa configurar o browser no **Real-Time Manager (RTM)** usando o [Rules Engine](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/rules-engine/).\n\nNo Google Chrome, siga os passos:\n\n1. Selecione **Ver** > **Desenvolvedor** > **Ferramentas para desenvolvedores**.\n2. Selecione a aba **Network**.\n3. Clique na primeira linha **page-cors-subdomain.a.html** e observe as informações de **Request URL** apresentadas no painel localizado à direita.\n4. Clique em **Test CORS on click** e observe a linha vermelha na seção **Name**.\n5. Posicione o cursor sobre a legenda/linha **page-cors-subdomain-a.txt** e observe o texto da tooltip.\n6. Selecione **page-cors-subdomain-a.txt** e observe as informações apresentadas no painel localizado à direita.\n7. Selecione a aba **Console** > **Erros** e observe, na linha de erro do CORS, os domínios de origem e de destino.\n\nVá para o [RTM](https://manager.azion.com/) e siga os seguintes passos:\n\n1. Selecione **Products menu** > **Edge Application**.\n2. Selecione a aplicação do *domain A (a.domain)* > **Rules Engine**.\n3. Clique no botão **Add Rule** para criar uma nova regra e selecione **Response Phase**.\n4. Nomeie sua regra.\n5. Na seção **Criteria**, preencha os campos com os seguintes conteúdos:\n    *If `${http_origin}` is equal `http://b-domain.com`* (sem terminar em `/`)\n6. Na seção **Behaviors**, selecione o comportamento **Add Response Header**.\n7. Preencha o campo de argumento com `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: ${http_origin}`.\n\nEm seguida, vá para a página HTML e digite o seguinte código:\n\n```html\n#1 page-cors-subdomain-a.html\n<h2>Using the XMLHttpRequest Object</h2>\n\n<div id=\"demo\">\n<button type=\"button\" onclick=\"loadXMLDoc()\">Test CORS on click</button>\n</div>\n\n<script>\nfunction loadXMLDoc() {\n  var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();\n  xhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {\n\tif (this.readyState == 4 && this.status == 200) {\n  \tdocument.getElementById(\"demo\").innerHTML =\n  \tthis.responseText;\n\t}\n  };\n  xhttp.open(\"GET\", \"http://a.domain.com/page-cors-subdomain-a.txt\", true);\n  xhttp.send();\n}\n</script>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n\n#2 page-cors-subdomain-a.txt\nYou clicked!\nI belong to the domain a.\nDomain b shall call me.\n```\n\nPor último, para validar que o erro foi corrigido, siga os seguintes passos:\n\n1. No **Google Chrome**, selecione **Ver** > **Desenvolvedor** > **Ferramentas para desenvolvedores**.\n2. Selecione a aba **Network**.\n3. Clique na primeira linha **page-cors-subdomain.a.html** e observe as informações apresentadas no painel localizado à direita da página.\n4. Clique em **Test CORS on click** e visualize a mensagem:\n    `You clicked! I belong to the domain a. Domain b shall call me.`\n5.

No canto superior direito, clique em **Save** para aplicar suas configurações.\n\n---\n\n## Melhores práticas\n\n- Para usar um gráfico de **Time series**, você deve informar um formato de hora/data no campo **Time path**. Ele deve ser preenchido com formato ISO8601 ou com um formato personalizável customizado.\n- Para agregar dados em múltiplos pontos de dados, você deve usar o campo **Group by**. Para usar um gráfico de **Time series**, esse campo é obrigatório.\n- Objetos aninhados são achatados com underlines.\n- Ao usar variáveis do Grafana, substitua-as diretamente no campo da query.\n- Para configurar ou mudar o nome de um campo exibido na legenda, use o campo **Alias by**: substitua `$field_<field.name>` com os valores para esse campo; substitua `$fieldName` com um nome para o campo.\n- [Use anotações](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/build-dashboards/annotate-visualizations/) para marcar pontos em um gráfico.\n- Use o filtro de [intervalo de tempo](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/use-dashboards/#time-units-and-relative-ranges) do dashboard para explorar e analisar seus dados.\n\n---\n\n## Leia mais no Grafana\n\n- [Create and use dashboards](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/)\n- [Grafana dashboard best practices](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/build-dashboards/best-practices/)\n- [Add and manage variables](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/variables/)\n- [Configuring time series in ISO8601](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/string/)\n- [Configuring time series in custom format](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/string-format/)\n- [Visualizations](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/panels-visualizations/visualizations/)\n- [Configuring a legend](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/panels-visualizations/visualizations/configure-legend/)\n- [Configuring value mappings](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/panels-visualizations/configure-value-mappings/)\n\n---\n\n### Marca registrada\n\n[Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/products/cloud/) é marca registrada de Grafana Labs.

    "body": "\nOs dados agregados podem ser considerados dados estruturados que foram agrupados de alguma forma. Eles sofrem algumas alterações para permitir um processamento analítico que busca uma análise segmentada.\n\nPara realizar uma consulta agregando os dados disponibilizados pela [GraphQL API](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/graphql-api/visao-geral/), siga os passos descritos no guia [Como rodar requisições da GraphQL no Postman](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/consultar-graphql-postman/) utilizando a URL `https://api.azionapi.net/metrics/graphql`.\n\nDepois, na caixa de código do Postman da requisição de GraphQL, adicione a seguinte **Aggregated Query**, modificando o `tsRange` de acordo com o intervalo de tempo que você quer utilizar:\n\n```graphql\nquery HttpQuery {\n httpRaw(\n   limit: 10,\n   filter: {\n     tsRange: {begin:\"2022-03-21T10:10:10\", end:\"2022-06-23T10:10:10\"}\n   }\n   aggregate: {sum: bytesSent}\n   groupBy: [ts]\n   orderBy: [ts_ASC]\n   )\n {\n   ts\n   sum\n }\n}\n```\n\nO exemplo acima consulta a tabela de dados **brutos** (raw) do dataset de **HTTP**. Além disso, o operador **sum** agrega os dados com as informações sobre o campo **bytesSent** em um determinado período de tempo definido pelo campo **tsRange**.\n\nPor fim, os dados foram agrupados e ordenados pelo campo **ts** (timestamp).\n\nPara consultas com dados agregados, é *obrigatório* informar:\n\n- Um intervalo de tempo para consulta, usando **tsRange** ou **tsGt** + **tsLt**.\n- Os campos em que deseja agrupar as informações, usando **groupBy**.\n- Quais dos dados obtidos na consulta devem ser exibidos. No caso do exemplo apresentado, foram usados **ts** e **sum**, onde **sum** é o retorno da agregação de **bytesSent**.\n\nPara agregar as informações fornecidas pela **GraphQL API**, existem algumas opções que devem ser informadas através do campo **aggregate** na query, como no exemplo apresentado anteriormente. São elas:\n\n- **Count**: determina o valor total de registros que atende a uma condição específica.\n- **Sum**: retorna a soma dos valores de entrada da coluna ou expressão.\n- **Max**: retorna o valor máximo de um determinado campo de uma tabela de acordo com o critério de seleção estabelecido.\n- **Min**: retorna o valor mínimo de um determinado campo de uma tabela de acordo com o critério de seleção estabelecido.\n- **Avg**: calcula a média aritmética de um conjunto de valores contidos em um campo especificado em uma consulta.\n- **Rate**: usado com o conjunto de dados imagesProcessed. Obtém a taxa de imagens processadas por segundo ao utilizar o Image Processor.\n\n> Você pode realizar uma consulta com cada uma das opções disponíveis: **count**, **sum**, **max**, **min**, **avg** e **rate**, contanto que cada opção seja utilizada apenas *uma* vez e cada operador faça a agregação de apenas *um* campo do conjunto de dados por vez. Veja o exemplo a seguir:\n\n```graphql\naggregate: {\n    count: rows, \n    sum: bytesSent, \n    avg: requestTime, \n    max: requestLength,\n    min: missedData,\n    rate: requestTime\n}\n```\n\n---\n\nEnvie sua requisição. Você receberá uma resposta semelhante a:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"data\": {\n       \"httpRaw\": [\n           {\n               \"ts\": \"2022-09-09T21:33:13\",\n               \"sum\": 1471.0\n           },\n           {\n               \"ts\": \"2022-09-09T21:33:14\",\n               \"sum\": 1471.0\n           },\n           {\n               \"ts\": \"2022-09-09T21:33:15\",\n               \"sum\": 1471.0\n           }\n       ]\n   }\n}\n```\n\nA GraphQL API retorna os dados de agregação com o operador **sum** sobre o campo **bytesSent**, de acordo com a query informada na requisição.\n\nPara saber mais sobre como consultar dados agregados com a GraphQL API, visite a [página de documentação](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/graphql-api-recursos/#queries-datasets).\n",

    "body": "\nVocê pode rodar requisições da [GraphQL API](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/graphql-api/visao-geral/) direitamente [no Postman](https://www.postman.com/) ou em outras plataformas de API. Para usar o Postman, você precisa completar dois passos: ⁠criar um personal token e rodar sua requisição no Postman. Veja as próximas seções e siga os passos apresentados.\n\n---\n\n## Criar um personal token\n\nAntes de rodar suas requisições com a **GraphQL API⁠**, você deve criar um personal token na Azion para validar seu acesso.\n\n1. No [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/), no canto superior direito, selecione **Account menu** > **Personal Tokens**.\n2. Preencha os campos para configurar o personal token e clique no botão **Create Token**.\n3. Copie e salve seu token em um local seguro para utilizá-lo na próxima seção.\n\n> Veja a documentação de [Personal Tokens](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/gestao-de-contas/personal-tokens/) para mais informações sobre como criar tokens.\n\nComo alternativa, você pode criar um token de curta duração usando a [API da Azion](https://api.azion.com/).\n\n---\n\n## Rodar requisições no Postman\n\nApós criar seu personal token, [vá para o Postman](https://www.postman.com/) e siga os próximos passos:\n\n1. No cabeçalho, clique no botão **+** para criar uma nova requisição.\n2. Na aba **Headers**, clique em⁠ **Bulk Edit** e adicione o código a seguir, substituindo [TOKEN VALUE] pelo valor do personal token que você criou:\n\n```json\nAuthorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]\n```\n\nContinue no **Postman** para criar o corpo da requisição:\n\n1. Selecione a aba **Body**.\n2. No canto superior esquerdo, clique na **opção** GET para abrir um menu suspenso.\n3. Selecione a opção **POST**.\n4. No campo **Enter URL or paste text**, adicione a URL sendo consultada: `https://api.azionapi.net/metrics/graphql` ou `https://api.azionapi.net/events/graphql`\n5. Na linha de opções, selecione **GraphQL**.\n6. Na caixa de código, adicione a query que você quer utilizar. Por exemplo:\n\n```graphql\nquery HttpQuery {\n  httpMetrics(\n    limit: 10,\n    filter: {\n      tsRange: {begin:\"2022-03-21T10:10:10\", end:\"2022-06-23T10:10:10\"}\n    }\n    aggregate: {sum: bytesSent}\n    groupBy: [ts]\n    orderBy: [ts_ASC]\n  )\n  {\n    ts\n    sum\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\n\n7. Clique no botão **Send** no canto superior direito.\n\nVocê receberá uma resposta com os dados solicitados, semelhante a:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"data\": {\n       \"httpMetrics\": [\n           {\n               \"ts\": \"2022-06-09T21:33:13\",\n               \"sum\": 1471.0\n           },\n           {\n               \"ts\": \"2022-06-09T21:33:14\",\n               \"sum\": 1471.0\n           },\n           {\n               \"ts\": \"2022-06-09T21:33:15\",\n               \"sum\": 1471.0\n           }\n       ]\n   }\n}\n```\n\nVocê encontra exemplos de queries no [repositório do⁠GitHub azion-queries](https://github.com/aziontech/azion-queries).\n\n",

    "body": "\nGzip é o método padrão de compressão *lossless* de arquivos para aplicações web. Por usar o algoritmo Deflate para reduzir o tamanho de arquivos antes de serem enviados a navegadores, a compressão gzip proporciona renderização de página e downloads mais rápidos para seus usuários.\n\n> Para mais informações e links úteis, consulte o [site oficial de gzip](https://www.gzip.org/).\n\nAo habilitar a compressão gzip para Azion **Edge Application**, os seguintes eventos acontecem durante uma requisição por conteúdo de sua aplicação:\n\n1. No edge node, a Azion verifica o cache por uma versão comprimida do arquivo.\n2. Se o arquivo já estiver comprimido, ele é entregue ao navegador. Se não, a Azion comprime o arquivo, devolve ao navegador, e o adiciona ao cache.\n3. O navegador do usuário interpreta e descompressa o arquivo.\n\n---\n\n## Usando Rules Engine para habilitar compressão gzip\n\nVocê pode habilitar a compressão gzip para qualquer edge application usando o [Rules Engine para Edge Application](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/rules-engine/).\n\n**Para habilitar a compressão gzip para sua aplicação, siga os passos:**\n\n1. [Acesse o Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).\n2. Selecione **Products menu** > **Edge Application**.\n3. Clique na aplicação que você deseja configurar.\n4. Na aba **Rules Engine**, clique no botão **Add Rule** e selecione **Response Phase** ou **Request Phase**.\n5. Na seção **Criteria**, defina o critério para ativação do comportamento.\n\n    > Para aplicar compressão gzip para sua aplicação como um todo, você pode definir um critério padrão da seguinte maneira:\n    >\n    > If `${uri}` starts with `/`\n\n6. Na seção **Behavior**, selecione o comportamento **Enable gzip**.\n7. Clique no botão **Save**.\n\nPara verificar se a compressão gzip foi aplicada, acesse sua aplicação e inspecione a página. O cabeçalho de requisição `Content-Encoding` deverá conter o valor `gzip`.\n\n---\n\n## Suporte para compressão gzip\n\nOs servidores Azion dão suporte à compressão gzip para extensões de arquivos específicos, identificadas através do tipo MIME (*Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions*).\n\n### Sobre tipos MIME\n\nQuando uma página carrega em um navegador, um servidor envia informação sobre o conteúdo e dados da página para o navegador. Esses detalhes são guardados em cabeçalhos de requisição e enviados ao navegador para que ele possa carregar e interpretar a página.\n\nO cabeçalho `Content-Type` é responsável por guardar informações sobre o tipo do conteúdo da página sob o tipo MIME. Os tipos MIME informam os tipos de documentos, arquivos ou sequências de bytes dentro da aplicação web, bem como a forma que elas devem ser processadas.\n\nO tipo MIME é composto de um tipo e subtipo combinados por um símbolo de `/` entre eles. O tipo representa a categoria do arquivo. Por exemplo: textos são tipo `text`; imagens são tipo `image`. Já o subtipo significa o tipo exato do dado representado pelo tipo MIME. Por exemplo: o tipo MIME `image` pode carregar os subtipos `jpeg` ou `png`.\n\nPortanto, quando seu navegador encontra um elemento HTML `<img>`, ele envia uma requisição ao servidor, e se a imagem do elemento for .png, o servidor retorna o cabeçalho e o MIME type: `Content-Type: image/png`.\n\n> A [*Internet Assigned Numbers Authority* (IANA)](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml) é a entidade responsável pelos tipos MIME oficiais.\n\nArquivos que passaram por compressão gzip devem manter seus tipos MIME originais no cabeçalho da requisição, pois o navegador é responsável por descomprimir o arquivo quando a requisição é finalizada.\n\n### Lista de tipos MIME suportados para compressão gzip\n\n| Tipo MIME                     | Extensão                                    | Tipo de documento                        |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| application/eot               | .eot

    "body": "\nA plataforma de Edge Computing da Azion conta com funções serverless que permitem a criação e o processamento de Edge Sites diretamente em nossos Edge Nodes, sem que seja necessário acessar alguma infraestrutura de origem. \n\nCom a Edge Function Hello World, você pode criar páginas de erro ou status que podem ser utilizadas para monitorar ou informar a situação de determinado serviço, em tempo real, diretamente no Edge, com alta disponibilidade e baixa latência.\n\nCombinado com o serviço de Data Streaming da Azion, o cliente pode enviar registros dos acessos feitos ao Edge Site para seus sistemas SIEM (*Security information and Event Management*), Big Data ou log servers e realizar análises sobre os dados coletados.\n\nAlgumas outras vantagens de utilizar a Edge Function Hello World:\n\n* flexibilidade para o cliente desenvolver aplicações;\n* infraestrutura de Edge Nodes distribuídos para processamento de Edge Sites;\n* possibilidade de executar regras de negócio no Edge.\n\n## Como funciona\n\nO funcionamento é bem simples. Basta instanciar uma function Hello World dentro de sua Edge Application e configurar qual a resposta desejada por meio dos parâmetros que a função recebe (*Args*). Quando uma requisição chegar no Edge, os critérios de validação são avaliados, e, se todos os requisitos forem atendidos, a function será executada.\n\nA seguir, para descrever o funcionamento de um Edge Site na Azion, iremos ilustrar um caso em que se deseja apresentar uma página de status com aviso de indisponibilidade temporária de um serviço (www.myapplication.com/api_service, por exemplo), construído por meio da Edge Function Hello World. \n\n## Configurando a function Hello World\n\nEdge Function Hello World está disponível na biblioteca de functions da plataforma de Edge Computing da Azion e pode ser acessada pelo Real-Time Manager (RTM), no menu *Libraries*.\n\nPara execução da function, ela tem de ser instanciada no **Edge Application** em que se deseja trabalhar e ter os seus critérios de ativação e comportamentos definidos dentro do **Rules Engine**.\n\n## Criando uma instância\n\n**Caminho:** Real-Time Manager > Edge Computing > Edge Applications > Sua Edge Application > Functions.\n\nA partir do RTM, acesse a Edge Application que irá rodar a sua function e, dentro da aba Functions, adicione uma nova, declarando um nome significativo para ela (*MyHelloWorld*, para ilustrar nosso exemplo).\n\n**Parâmetros:** é necessário selecionar qual function usar para a sua instância; nesse caso, escolha a opção Hello World, no campo \"Edge Function\". Note que o código da função aparecerá no campo Code apenas para leitura e entendimento. Na aba Args, informe o código HTTP e a mensagem de retorno desejada – vide exemplo abaixo – e salve a função. \n\n```json\n{\n    \"param\":{\n        \"http_status\": 503,\n        \"body\": \"We are working hard to serve you better!\"\n    }\n}\n```\nExemplo de configuração dos parâmetros JSON Args.\n\n## Definindo critérios de execução\n\n**Caminho:** Real-Time Manager > Edge Computing > Edge Applications > Sua Edge Application > Rules Engine.\n\nAs regras definidas no Rules Engine determinam o conjunto de condições que precisam ser atendidas para a execução dos Behaviors. Você pode utilizar a Default Rule ou criar uma nova regra a fim de configurar os parâmetros de validação e os comportamentos para execução de sua function pela Edge Application.\n\n**Definindo critérios de validação (*criteria*):** escolha as variáveis, operadores de comparação e strings para construção de sua regra de negócio, como no exemplo a seguir:\n\n* **If**: `${uri}` **starts with** ***/api_service***\n(na sequência: operador lógico, variável, operador de comparação, string)\n\nAqui a regra é executada se a URI acessada iniciar com a string “/api_service”.\n\n**Definindo comportamentos (*behaviors*):** adicione os comportamentos que deseja executar caso as condições da regra sejam satisfeitas. Exemplo:\n\n* **Then**: ***Run Function*** **MyHelloWorld**\n(na sequência: operador lógico, ação, função)\n\nNesse exemplo, se as condições definidas nas regras forem satisfeitas, então será executada a function MyHelloWorld. Assim sendo, quando um usuário acessar a URL \"www.myapplication.com/api_service\", a function será executada e a mensagem configurada, exibida.\n\nPor fim, salve a sua Edge Application e esta já estará pronta para executar a nova function. \n\n\n",

    "body": "\n**Rules Engine** é um recurso de **Edge Application** que permite que você crie soluções sem necessidade de código, aplicando as regras de negócio do seu aplicativo diretamente no edge.\n\nCom a arquitetura de proxy reverso da Azion **Edge Application**, as regras que você cria serão executadas entre a **Request phase**, que contém dados que o cliente envia para uma origem, ou a **Response phase**, que contém dados da origem que são enviados para o cliente.\n\nConsulte a documentação oficial do [Rules Engine](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/rules-engine/) para obter mais informações.\n\n---\n\n## Criar uma regra de Request: Rewrite Request\n\nAs regras criadas na **Request phase** serão executadas antes que a requisição aos servidores de origem seja concluída. Por exemplo, usando o comportamento **Rewrite Request**, você pode criar uma regra para entregar conteúdo a um usuário a partir de uma URI específica sem que ele precise especificar o caminho exato da origem na requisição.\n\nPara ilustrar esse guia, presuma que o seu objetivo é o de entregar o conteúdo da página `/content/page.html` quando um cliente faz uma requisição para `https://www.domain.com/page`. Para criar uma regra que irá reescrever esta requisição:\n\n1. Acesse o [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).\n2. No canto superior esquerdo da página, vá para **Products menu** > **Edge Application**.\n3. Selecione a edge application para qual você deseja criar a regra.\n4. Na aba **Main Settings**, habilite o módulo **Application Acceleration**.\n5. Selecione a aba **Rules Engine**.\n6. Clique no botão **Add Rule**.\n7. No menu suspenso, selecione **Request Phase**.\n8. Dê um nome à sua regra e, se necessário, uma descrição.\n9. Na seção **Criteria**, configure seus critérios da seguinte forma:\n\n   If `${uri}` *is equal to* `/page`\n   > Este critério irá identificar a URL da requisição pela barra `/` que inicia a URI.\n\n\n\n1. Na seção **Behaviors**, adicione o comportamento que você deseja que sua aplicação execute. Nesse caso, **Rewrite Request**.\n2. O comportamento selecionado leva um argumento; para redirecionar a requisição para a página:\n\n   `${uri}content/page.html`\n   > Este argumento concatena a variável `${uri}`, cujo valor é`/`, para o caminho da página.\n\n\n\n1. Clique no botão **Save** para salvar sua regra.\n\nAgora, quando uma requisição for feita para a URL `https://www.domain.com/page`, os usuários irão visualizar o conteúdo da página `/content/page.html`, sem precisar especificar este endereço no navegador.\n\n---\n\n## Criar uma regra de Response: Filter Response Header\n\nAs regras criadas na **Response phase** serão executadas antes que a resposta seja entregue ao cliente. Por exemplo, você pode criar uma regra que irá remover um cabeçalho HTTP da resposta usando o comportamento **Filter Response Header**.\n\nO cabeçalho `Server` armazena informações sobre o servidor que gerou a resposta. Ao remover esse cabeçalho, você impede que clientes recebam informações sobre a infraestrutura da sua aplicação, aumentando sua segurança ao reduzir a quantidade de dados disponíveis para possíveis invasores.\n\n> **Nota**: tome cuidado ao remover quaisquer cabeçalhos de sua edge application. Certifique-se de que essa ação não interfira em nenhum padrão ou em diretrizes legais.\n\nPara remover o cabeçalho `Server` da resposta:\n\n1. Acesse o [RTM](https://manager.azion.com/).\n2.

Para saber mais sobre novos recursos e como utilizá-los, consulte a [página do produto](https://www.azion.com/pt-br/produtos/edge-firewall/) e [documentações](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/).\n\nRule Sets deprecated do Edge Firewall mostram o banner: `This Edge Firewall rule set is deprecated. Please upgrade to the new version.`\n\n[![banner](/assets/docs/images/update-edge-firewall/banner.jpg)](/assets/docs/images/update-edge-firewall/banner.jpg)\n\n\n---\n\n## O que mudou?\n\nAté agora, o uso de uma Rule Set do Edge Firewall ou WAF se dava através da ativação dos módulos Edge Firewall e Web Application Firewall na aba Main Settings de cada Edge Application e posterior utilização dos Behaviors **Set Edge Firewall Rule Set** e **Set WAF Rule Set** no Rules Engine da Edge Application.\n\nO Edge Firewall tornou-se um produto independente que concentra todas funcionalidades de segurança: **DDoS Protection**, **Network Layer Protection**, **Web Application Firewall** e **Edge Functions**.\n\n> Atenção, para atualizar sua versão do **Edge Firewall** é necessário estar com a última versão do produto **Edge Application**.\n\n---\n\n## Transferindo as suas Rule Sets para a versão mais recente do Edge Firewall\n\nPara usar o Azion Edge Firewall mais recente, siga os passos abaixo, cada seção indica em detalhes como cada funcionalidade é construída usando os novos módulos, Network Lists e Rules Engine.\n\n### Passo 1 - Criando novas rule sets no Edge Firewall\n\nO primeiro passo para criar uma Rule Set e criar novas regras com base nas regras pré existentes. Durante o processo vamos explicar como cada uma das funcionalidades é configurada na versão recente:\n\n#### Criar Rule Set do Edge Firewall:\n\n1. Acesse o [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/), entre no menu **Products** no canto superior esquerdo, em **SECURE** selecione **Edge Firewall**. Você também pode clicar diretamente em Edge Firewall na página Getting started.\n2. Adicione um **Edge Firewall** clicando em **Add a Rule Set** ou edite um já criado.\n3. Siga os passos abaixo de acordo com a funcionalidade:\n\n#### Referrer Blocking\n\n[![referer-blocking](/assets/docs/images/update-edge-firewall/referer-blocking.jpg)](/assets/docs/images/update-edge-firewall/referer-blocking.jpg)\n\nSe você usava **Referer Block** em sua rule set deprecated, na nova rule set:\n\n1. Habilite o módulo **Web Application Firewall**.\n2. Em seguida, siga na Aba **Rules Engine** e clique em **New Rule**. Em **Criteria**, selecione **Header Referer**.\n3. Adicione o domínio da Rule Set antiga com a condição **Header Referer**, utilizando o comparador **does not match**.\n4. Para cada domínio em Accepted Domains da Rule Set antiga, adicione uma regra **AND** repetindo o passo 3.\n5. Em **Behavior**, selecione o Behavior **Deny 403**.\n\n#### Geo Blocking\n\n[![geo-blocking](/assets/docs/images/update-edge-firewall/geo-blocking.jpg)](/assets/docs/images/update-edge-firewall/geo-blocking.jpg)\n\nSe você usava **Geo Blocking** em sua rule set deprecated, na nova rule set:\n\n1. Acesse o [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/), entre no menu **Libraries** e selecione **Network Lists**.\n2. Clique em **Add** para adicionar ou editar uma **Network List**.\n3. Na opção **Type**, selecione **Countries**.\n4. Copie a lista de países da rule set deprecated para a **Network Lists**.\n5. Em **Edge Firewall**, habilite o módulo **Network Layer Protection**.\n6. Na aba **Rules Engine**, crie uma nova **Rule** e selecione o **Criteria: Network**.\n7. Incluir o operador lógico, por exemplo, se for **Match** para **Blacklist**, ou **Does not Match** para **Whitelist**.\n8. Após, selecione a **Network List** do tipo **Country** criada nos passos 3 e 4.\n9. Em **Behavior**, selecione o Behavior **Deny 403**.\n\n#### Secure Token\n\n[![secure-token](/assets/docs/images/update-edge-firewall/secure-token.jpg)](/assets/docs/images/update-edge-firewall/secure-token.jpg)\n\nSe você usava **Secure Token** em sua rule set deprecated, na nova rule set:\n\n1. Habilite o módulo **Edge Functions**.\n2. Na aba **Functions**, clique em **Add function** para instanciar uma Edge Function de **Secure Token**.\n3. Preencha as informações e utilize o editor para customizar **Args** da Função para definir a secret que será utilizada para composição do hash.\n4. Na aba **Rules Engine** defina o **Criteria** para condicionar o uso da Edge Function.\n5. Em **Behavior** selecione **Run Function** e selecione a **Edge Function** e escolha a Function **Secure Token** instanciada nos passos 2 e 3.\n\n#### IP Blocking\n\n[![ip-blocking](/assets/docs/images/update-edge-firewall/ip-blocking.jpg)](/assets/docs/images/update-edge-firewall/ip-blocking.jpg)\n\nSe você usava **IP Blocking** em sua rule set deprecated, na nova rule set:\n\n1. Acesse o [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/), entre no menu **Libraries** e selecione **Network Lists**.\n2. Adicione ou Edite uma **Network List**.\n3. Na opção **Type**, selecione **IP/CIDR**.\n4. Copie a lista de países da rule set deprecated para sua **Network Lists**.\n5. Em **Edge Firewall**, habilite o módulo **Network Layer Protection**.\n6. Na aba **RuleS Engine**, crie uma nova **Rule** e selecione o **Criteria: Network**.\n7. Incluir o operador lógico, por exemplo, se for **Match** é **Blacklist**, se for **Does not Match** equivale a **Whitelist**.\n8. Após, selecione a **Network List** do tipo **IP/CIDR** criada nos passos 3 e 4.\n9. Em **Behavior**, selecione o Behavior **Deny 403**.\n\n#### Rate Limiting\n\n[![rate-limiting](/assets/docs/images/update-edge-firewall/rate-limiting.jpg)](/assets/docs/images/update-edge-firewall/rate-limiting.jpg)\n\nSe você usava **Rate Limiting** em sua rule set deprecated, na nova rule set:\n\n1. Selecione a Aba **Rules Engine**.\n2. Em seguida, defina uma **Criteria** para sua Rule Set.\n3. Em **Behavior**, selecione **Set Rate Limit**.\n4. Defina o número de requisições por segundo em **Average Rate Limit**.\n5. Configure para **Client IP** Address ou **Global**.\n6. Após, defina o **Maximum burst size**.\n\n#### Associação de Domains à nova Rule Set\n\nApós efetuar as configurações, associe um ou mais **domains** à nova **Rule Set**\n\n1. Edite a nova **Rule Set** do **Edge Firewall**.\n2. Em **Main Settings**, na seção **Domains**, selecione domains que deseja associar à **Rule Set**.\n3. **Salve** para aplicar a configuração.\n\n#### Associação de WAF Rule Set\n\nApós efetuar as configurações, associe seus WAF Rule Sets à nova Rule Set. WAF Rule Sets são usados da mesma forma, porém, passam do Edge Application para o Rules Engine do Edge Firewall:\n\n1. Edite a nova **Rule Set** do **Edge Firewall**.\n2. Habilite o módulo **Web Application Firewall**.\n3. Na aba **Rules Engine** adicione ou edite uma Rule.\n4. Na Rule, defina o **Criteria** para condicionar o uso da WAF Rule Set.\n5. Em **Behavior** selecione **Set WAF Rule Set** e escolha um WAF Rule Set.\n6. **Salve** para aplicar a configuração.\n\n### Passo 2 - Removendo as regras de Edge Firewall no Edge Application\n\nDepois de criar e aplicar as Rule Sets da versão mais recente do Edge Firewall para seu domínio, remova as Rules em Edge Application:\n\n1. Acesse o [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/),  entre no menu **Products** no canto superior esquerdo e em **BUILD** selecione **Edge Applications**.\n2. Edite uma **Edge Application** com configuração de **Edge Firewall**.\n3. Entre na aba **Rules Engine** e identifique as **Rules Sets** com **Behaviors Set Edge Firewall** ou **Set WAF Rule Set**.\n4. Agora basta remover o **Behavior** de **Edge Firewall**.\n5. Em seguida, confirme a remoção clicando em **Delete** e sua regra já estará excluída.\n\n",

Esta solution emprega uma edge function para avaliar os dados de uma request e negar payloads que excedam o limite pré-definido.\n\nA função valida o tamanho do payload da request, verificando o cabeçalho `Content-Length`. O cabeçalho `Content-Length` é necessário para tornar segura a sua leitura, ao invés de sempre ler o `body` da request. Desta maneira, os usuários estão protegidos contra tentativas de alterar o valor do cabeçalho e a leitura do `Content-Length` é o melhor curso de ação do ponto de vista de desempenho.\n\n---\n\n## Obtendo a solution\n\nPara instalar a solution, siga estes passos:\n\n1. Entre na sua conta do [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).\n    - Se você não tiver uma, você pode [criar sua conta aqui](https://sso.azion.com/).\n2.

Clique no botão **Get It Now**.\n\n> Após clicar no botão Get it now, você verá uma mensagem indicando que sua solution foi instalada com sucesso e está pronta para ser usada.\n\n---\n\n## Usando a solution \n\n### Criando uma regra do Edge Firewall\n\nPara instanciar a solution Limit Payload Size, siga os passos:\n\n1. No RTM, em **Products menu**, selecione **Edge Firewall** na seção **SECURE**.\n2. Clique no botão **Add Rule Set**.\n3. Dê um nome fácil de lembrar para sua nova regra.\n4. Selecione os domínios que você deseja proteger com a função.\n5. Habilite o switch **Edge Functions**.\n6. Clique no botão **Save**.\n\nPronto. Agora você instanciou uma regra para sua função.\n\n---\n\n### Configurando a solution\n\nPara terminar de instanciar a solution, ainda na página **Edge Firewall**, selecione a guia **Functions** e siga estes passos:\n\n1. Clique no botão **Add Function**.\n2. Dê um nome fácil de lembrar para a sua instância.\n3. No menu suspenso, selecione a função **Limit Payload Size**.\n\nEsta ação irá carregar a função, mostrando um formulário com o código-fonte dela e, logo acima dele, duas abas: **Code** e **Args**. Ao clicar na aba Code, você poderá navegar pelo código, mas não poderá modificá-lo.\n\nNesta solution você passará somente um argumento em Args:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"max_payload_length\": \"10kb\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Algumas informações sobre como esta solution funciona:\n\n- O `max_payload_length` é o tamanho máximo do payload que sua função aceitará. \n- Este campo aceita bytes, kilobytes e megabytes como argumento. \n- Se você não especificar a unidade de tamanho para o payload, a função assumirá como sendo em bytes.\n- Se você não passar nenhum argumento, a função irá ignorar a execução. \n- Sempre que o tamanho do payload exceder o limite estabelecido pelo usuário, a solution retornará um erro 403.\n\n---\n\n## Configurando o Rules Engine\n\nPara terminar o processo, é preciso configurar o [Rules Engine](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/rules-engine/) indicando o *behavior* e o *criteria* necessários para executar a solution.\n\nAinda na página do **Edge Firewall**, selecione a guia **Rules Engine** e siga estes passos:\n\n1. Clique no botão **New Rule**.\n2. Dê um nome fácil de lembrar para sua regra.\n3. Selecione o *criteria* que deseja usar para a execução e o domínio no qual você deseja rodar a solution.\n4. Abaixo, selecione um *behavior* para este *criteria*. Neste caso, será **Run Function**. Em seguida, selecione a função **Limite Payload Size**, de acordo com o nome que você deu no passo de instanciação.\n5. Clique no botão **Save**.\n\nPronto. Agora a solution está sendo executada para cada request feita ao domínio que você indicou.\n\n\n",

    "body": "\nAs aplicações que utilizam o protocolo HTTPS requerem um [Digital Certificate](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/digital-certificates/). Ao direcionar seu tráfego para a Azion, você tem a opção de gerar um certificado *Let's Encrypt*™, que é uma maneira gratuita e segura de criptografar dados para sua edge application. A Azion automatiza a emissão, renovação e desativação deste certificado TLS através de uma solução interna de gerenciamento de certificados.\n\n---\n\n## Antes de começar\n\nA Azion gera certificados Let's Encrypt para domínios e subdomínios registrados no Domain Name System (DNS). Os domínios podem ser adquiridos e registrados em zonas DNS por meio de um provedor de DNS de terceiros, como [GoDaddy](http://www.godaddy.com/) ou [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/get-a-domain/).\n\nPara os fins deste guia, suponha que o *fully-qualified domain name* (FQDN) para o qual você deseja gerar um certificado Let's Encrypt seja um registro CNAME `​​www.seudominio.org​`​ em uma zona DNS ​`​seudominio.org​`​.\n\n---\n\n## Gerar um certificado Let's Encrypt \n\nVocê pode optar por gerar um certificado Let's Encrypt para registros de domínio hospedados no [Intelligent DNS](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/intelligent-dns/) ou no provedor de DNS externo do seu domínio.\n\nPara isso, você terá que preparar seu servidor DNS e criar registros para que a Azion possa criar e gerenciar seu certificado Let's Encrypt.\n\n### Opção 1: Preparar a entrada de DNS no Azion Intelligent DNS\n\nA Azion permite que você hospede zonas DNS redirecionando a resolução DNS de um domínio para o **Intelligent DNS**. Ao usar o Intelligent DNS, todas as configurações necessárias são feitas através do Azion **Real-Time Manager**.\n\nPara criar uma zona DNS para um registro de domínio `www.seudominio.org` no **Intelligent DNS**:\n\n1. Acesse o [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com).\n2. No canto superior esquerdo da página, clique nas três linhas horizontais para abrir o **Products menu**.\n3. Na seção **SECURE**, selecione **Intelligent DNS**.\n4. Se você não tiver uma zona ativa, clique no botão **Add Zone**.\n5. Dê um nome fácil de lembrar à sua zona.\n6. Indique o FQDN conforme registrado no DNS. Exemplo: `seudominio.org`.\n7. Clique no botão **Save**.\n\n> Para obter mais informações sobre como redirecionar os servidores DNS autorizados do seu domínio, consulte a documentação do [Intelligent DNS](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/intelligent-dns/).\n\nDepois que sua resolução de DNS for redirecionada com sucesso e estiver hospedada no Intelligent DNS, você poderá criar um novo *registro CNAME* para o domínio seguindo as etapas:\n\n1. Na página do **Intelligent DNS** no [RTM](https://manager.azion.com), selecione a zona desejada.\n2. Navegue até a aba **Records**.\n3. Em **Name**, crie um *hostname* ou subdomínio. Exemplo: `www`\n4. Em **Type**, selecione **CNAME - Canonical name**.\n5. Em **Value**, insira o endereço de domínio fornecido pela Azion no formato FQDN. Exemplo: `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`\n   - Se você não tiver um domínio, vá para a seção [Criar um domínio](#criar-um-domínio) para obter mais informações.\n6. Defina o **TTL** e **Policy** conforme desejado.\n7. Clique no botão **Save**.\n\nSe a entrada **CNAME** listada em seu domínio Azion tiver sido criada em sua zona do **Intelligent DNS**, a Azion verificará automaticamente a autenticidade do domínio e o certificado Let's Encrypt ficará ativo. Vá para a seção [Verificar o status dos certificados Let's Encrypt](#verificar-o-status-do-certificado-lets-encrypt) para obter mais informações sobre os status dos certificados.\n\n### Opção 2: Preparar a entrada de DNS com um provedor de DNS externo\n\nSe você tiver um domínio registrado em uma zona DNS externa, a Azion verificará a autenticidade do domínio em um provedor DNS externo, concluindo o método Let's Encrypt chamado [DNS-01 ACME client challenge](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#dns-01-challenge) para emitir o certificado.\n\n> Se você já tiver uma zona no **Intelligent DNS**, o desafio DNS-01 será concluído automaticamente.\n\nPara permitir que o desafio DNS-01 ocorra:\n\n1. Acesse o site do seu provedor de DNS.\n2. Navegue até a área de gerenciamento de DNS.\n3. Crie um **registro CNAME** para cada domínio que você deseja usar o certificado. Este deve ser o mesmo CNAME que você adicionará ao campo **CNAME** ao criar seu domínio mais tarde. Exemplo: `seudominio.org`\n4. Adicione um novo registro ao seu domínio da seguinte forma:\n\n| Nome | Valor | Tipo |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `_acme-challenge.<seu domínio>` <br /><br />Exemplo:<br />`_acme-challenge.www.seudominio.org` | `<seu domínio>.letsencrypt.azion.com` <br /><br />Exemplo:<br />`www.seudominio.org.letsencrypt.azion.com` | CNAME |\n\n\n\n1. Repita as etapas 3 e 4 para cada CNAME que você pretende adicionar ao seu **Domain**.\n2. Salve suas alterações.\n\nAgora que o desafio pode acontecer, o próximo passo é criar um domínio na Azion.\n\n---\n\n## Criar um domínio\n\n> Para criar um domínio no **Domain** da Azion, você deve primeiro ter uma edge application. Se você ainda não criou uma edge application, vá para o [Ponto de partida](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/ponto-de-partida/).\n\nDepois de ter uma edge application, você precisa [criar um domínio](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/domains/) e listar os CNAMEs que deseja proteger com o certificado Let's Encrypt. Para fazer isso, siga os passos:\n\n1. Acesse o [RTM](https://manager.azion.com).\n2. No canto superior esquerdo, selecione as três linhas horizontais para abrir o **Products menu** > **Domains**.\n3. Clique no botão **Add Domain**.\n4. Dê um nome a seu domínio. Exemplo: `Domínio`.\n5. Em **Edge Certificate**, selecione a opção **Let's Encrypt**.\n6. Em **CNAME**, adicione o FQDN do domínio que você criou nas seções anteriores. Exemplo: `www.seudominio.org`\n7. Em **Edge Application**, selecione a aplicação que você criou.\n8. Clique no botão **Save**.\n\n---\n\n## Verificar o status do certificado Let's Encrypt\n\nVocê pode verificar o status do seu certificado TLS Let's Encrypt seguindo os passos:\n\n1. [No RTM](https://manager.azion.com), acesse o **Products menu**.\n2. Em **EDGE LIBRARIES**, selecione **Digital Certificates**.\n3. Na sua lista de certificados digitais, você verá uma nova entrada no formato `Domínio - Let's Encrypt <timestamp>`.\n\nO status à direita da lista mostra se o certificado foi emitido. Um certificado com o status **Active** foi verificado e emitido com sucesso. O status **Pending** significa que o certificado ainda está sendo verificado no gerenciador interno de certificados da Azion.\n\n> **Observação**: se o status **Pending** permanecer por mais de 48 horas, você deve verificar se os registros CNAME listados na seção [Criar um domínio](#criar-um-domínio) estão corretos.\n\n---\n\n## Gerenciar um certificado Let's Encrypt\n\nUma vez que o certificado é submetido à validação de DNS, ele não exigirá renovação manual após o vencimento, que ocorre após *90 dias*. A desativação ocorrerá se o certificado for excluído ou se o domínio associado for excluído da Azion.\n\n> **Aviso**: para garantir que o certificado seja renovado para domínios hospedados em serviços externos, **não exclua a entrada de desafio DNS** que você criou na seção [Opção 2: Preparar a entrada de DNS com um provedor de DNS externo](#opção-2-preparar-a-entrada-de-dns-com-um-provedor-de-dns-externo).\n\n---\n\n## Apontar seu tráfego para Azion\n\nDepois de ter um certificado Let's Encrypt ativo, você pode apontar seu tráfego para o Azion associando seu domínio fornecido pela Azion (`xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`) ao registro CNAME do seu domínio. Para fazer isso:\n\n1. [Acesse o RTM](https://manager.azion.com).\n2. No canto superior esquerdo da página, acesse **Products menu** > **Domains**.\n3. Na lista de **Domains**, copie o endereço de domínio fornecido pelo Azion que você deseja associar ao domínio externo, que deve estar no formato `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`.\n4. Em outra guia do navegador, acesse seu provedor de DNS.\n5. Navegue até a área de gerenciamento de DNS.\n6. Edite o registro CNAME de domínio que você associou ao certificado Let's Encrypt da seguinte forma:\n\n| Nome | Valor | Tipo |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `www.seudominio.org` | `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net` | CNAME |\n\n\n\n1. Salve suas alterações.\n\nPode haver um atraso no tempo de propagação quando você acessa seu aplicativo. Se esse for o caso, você pode [executar o comando DIG](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/executar-o-comando-dig/) no seu terminal para verificar se o seu domínio está apontando para o endereço Azion.\n\n\n",

Clique em **Save** no canto inferior direito da página.\n\n> **Nota**: aparecerá uma mensagem indicando que a edge application foi atualizada com sucesso.\n\nIsto ativará a guia **Functions** na sua edge application e, com isso, você será capaz de instanciar a edge function A/B Testing em sua edge application.\n\n---\n\n## Adicionando Origins\n\nNo arquivo de configuração, onde temos os **Args**, você terá que registrar as origens (os sites) para as quais você deseja usar o seu teste. Cada origem receberá uma chave única, chamada de `Origin Key`.\n\nPara isso, na página inicial da sua edge application atual, siga estas etapas:\n\n1. Vá para a guia **Origins**.\n2. Clique no botão **Add Origin**.\n3. Dê um nome fácil de lembrar para esta origem.\n4. Selecione **Single Origin** para o tipo de origem.\n5. Selecione `${host}` para a opção **Host Header**.\n6. Você pode passar um **Origin Path**, mas é opcional.\n7. Escolha o protocolo que você deseja utilizar: `HTTP`, `HTTPS` ou `preserve` para preservar o protocolo original.\n8. Passe a URL que você deseja registrar para esta origem.\n9. Clique no botão **Save**.\n\nApós salvar suas alterações, você poderá ver a `Origin Key` gerada pelo RTM para a origem que você registrou. Ela será utilizada para preencher o campo `originid` na caixa de código **Args** da sua function.\n\n> Importante: você deve registrar **pelo menos duas** origens.\n\n---\n\n## Instanciando a solução\n\nPara instanciar uma solução A/B Testing, siga os passos abaixo:\n\n1. Na lista superior, selecione a guia **Functions**..\n2. Clique no botão **Add Function**.\n3. Escolha um nome para a sua função que seja fácil de lembrar.\n4. No menu suspenso, selecione a função **A/B Testing [Global]**.\n\nIsto irá carregar o código-fonte da função referente à solução A/B testing. Logo acima você terá duas abas: **Code** e **Args**.\n\nSe você clicar na aba **Code**, será possível navegar pelo código para se familiarizar com ele, mas sem alterá-lo. A configuração de sua função A/B Testing estará na aba **Args**. Clique na guia **Args** para editar o arquivo de configuração no formato JSON, na qual você passará os parâmetros para executar sua aplicação.\n\nDentro do form de Args, você deverá passar os argumentos de configuração do arquivo JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"param\": {\n\t\t\"cookie\": {\n\t\t\t\"name\": \"azion_abtest\",\n\t\t\t\"expiration\": \"Wed, 04 May 2011 10:16:00 GMT\",\n\t\t\t\"max_age\": 600,\n\t\t\t\"domain\": \"localhost\",\n\t\t\t\"path\": \"/\"\n\t\t},\n\t\t\"a\": {\n\t\t\t\"cookie_value\": \"A_TEST\",\n\t\t\t\"prob\": 0.5,\n\t\t\t\"addresses_list\": \"localhost:2006\",\n\t\t\t\"originid\": \"uuid1\",\n\t\t\t\"live_ingest\": false,\n\t\t\t\"protocol_policy\": \"http\",\n\t\t\t\"path\": \"\",\n\t\t\t\"cache_key\": \"test_a\",\n\t\t\t\"host\": \"localhost\"\n\t\t},\n\t\t\"b\": {\n\t\t\t\"cookie_value\": \"B_TEST\",\n\t\t\t\"prob\": 0.5,\n\t\t\t\"addresses_list\": \"localhost:2010\",\n\t\t\t\"originid\": \"uuid2\",\n\t\t\t\"live_ingest\": false,\n\t\t\t\"protocol_policy\": \"preserve\",\n\t\t\t\"path\": \"\",\n\t\t\t\"cache_key\": \"test_b\",\n\t\t\t\"host\": \"localhost\"\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nOnde:\n\n1. `name`: o nome do cookie que você escolherá (novamente, escolha um nome significativo que será fácil de lembrar).\n2. `expiration`: a data de expiração do cookie.\n3. `max_age`: o tempo em segundos para a vida útil deste cookie. \n4. `domain`: o domínio onde você está executando os testes.\n5. `path`: o subdomínio para o cookie. Você pode usar `/` para definir que o subdomínio engloba todos os domínios.\n\nNa segunda seção, chamada `a`, você irá adicionar os parâmetros do primeiro teste:\n\n1. `cookie_value`: um valor para identificar o cookie para esta variação de teste.\n2. `prob`: a probabilidade deste endereço ser enviado ao usuário. Note que este valor deve estar entre 0 e 1, sendo 0 para 0% de chance e 1 para 100% de chance.\n3. `adressess_list`: o endereço para um teste. Por exemplo, `www.mytest_ab_of_my_site.com:443`.\n4. `originid`: o *ID* de identificação para a origem. O **RTM** gera este valor automaticamente.\n5. `live_ingest`: indica se a origem é uma *live streaming*. Adicione um valor booleano `true` ou `false`.\n6. `protocol_policy`: você pode forçar HTTP ou HTTPS, ou mesmo manter o valor padrão, deixando o valor como `preserve`.\n7. `path`: indica o subdomínio do cookie. Você pode deixá-lo em branco \" \" para indicar que ele é válido para todos os domínios.\n8. `cache_key`: informe um nome para identificar o cache, que deve ser único.\n9. `host`: o nome do host que será enviado na requisição.\n\n---\n## 6. Configurando o Rules Engine\n\nNa guia **Rules Engine**, você passará dois campos, *criteria* (critério) e *behavior* (comportamento), para executar a solução.\n\n1. Selecione a aba **Rules Engine**.\n2. Clique na guia **Default Rule**.\n    - Observe que você não pode alterar ou configurar a **Default Rule**.\n3. Em *behavior*, escolha **Run Function** e, no menu suspenso, escolha a solução **A/B Testing** de acordo com o nome que você lhe deu anteriormente.\n4. Adicione outro *behavior* clicando no botão **+** logo abaixo do primeiro.\n5. Passe o primeiro *behavior* adicional: **Bypass Cache**.\n6. Clique novamente no botão **+** abaixo do segundo behavior.\n7. Passe o segundo *behavior* adicional: **Forward Cookies**.\n8. Clique no botão **Save**.\n\nPronto. Agora você terá que esperar que a sua edge application se propague através dos nós do edge da Azion.\n\n---\n\nVisite o artigo [Configure testes A/B no Edge](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/ab-testing/) na página de casos de uso para encontrar mais informações de referência.\n\n\n",

Quando uma nova solicitação é feita por outro cliente, um cookie é definido e todo o tráfego é redirecionado para esta versão (ou para outra, de acordo com a probabilidade passada nos parâmetros).\n\nAssim, a partir deste ponto, todo o tráfego deste cliente é redirecionado para esta versão.\n\nO edge node encaminha a consulta para o aplicativo de origem, que retorna o conteúdo da página de teste, e o conteúdo é entregue ao usuário no edge.\n\n---\n\n## Configurando a solução A/B Testing\n\nA solução A/B ⁠Testing está disponível no Marketplace da Azion e pode ser acessada através [do Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/) no **Products menu** > **Marketplace**.\n\nVocê pode se aprofundar mais em como instalar e configurar a solução A/B Testing da Azion lendo o guia [Como utilizar a solution A/B testing através do Marketplace da Azion](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/ab-testing-marketplace/) na página de documentação.\n\n---\n\n## Exemplo de configuração para a solução A/B Testing\n\nAbaixo, você pode ver um exemplo de um arquivo de configuração `JSON` de uma função **A/B Testing** básica. Observe que, neste caso em particular, está sendo mantida uma probabilidade de 90% (0,9) para a primeira variante e 10% (0,1) para a segunda.\n\n> Não se esqueça de que a soma das duas probabilidades deve ser sempre 1.\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"param\": {\n\t\t\"cookie\": {\n          \"name\": \"MYABTEST_NAME__\",\n          \"expiration\": \"Wed, 04 May 2021 10:16:00 GMT\",\n          \"max_age\": 600,\n          \"domain\": \"localhost\",\n          \"path\": \"/\"\n\t\t},\n        \"a\": {\n            \"cookie_value\": \"A_VARIANT\",\n            \"prob\": 0.9,\n            \"addresses_list\": \"www.mytest_ab_of_my_site.com:443\",\n            \"originid\": \"uuid1\",\n            \"live_ingest\": false,\n            \"protocol_policy\": \"https\",\n            \"path\": \"\",\n            \"cache_key\": \"test_a\",\n            \"host\": \"localhost\"\n        },\n        \"b\": {\n            \"cookie_value\": \"B_VARIANT\",\n            \"prob\": 0.1,\n            \"addresses_list\": \"www.mytest_ab_of_my_site.com:2010\",\n            \"originid\": \"uuid2\",\n            \"live_ingest\": false,\n            \"protocol_policy\": \"https\",\n            \"path\": \"\",\n            \"cache_key\": \"test_b\",\n            \"host\": \"localhost\"\n        }\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Definindo as regras no Rules Engine\n\nO conjunto de condições que devem ser atendidas para que os *behaviors* (comportamentos) sejam executados é determinado pelas regras do **Rules Engine**. Você pode usar a **Default Rule** se quiser executar sua função sem passar nenhum elemento condicional, ou criar uma nova regra para passar as condições de execução de sua função.\n\n### Definição dos criteria (critérios) de validação\n\nEscolha as variáveis, operadores de comparação e strings para criar sua regra de negócios, como no exemplo a seguir:\n\n- `If: ${uri} is equal /home`\n\n> Lógica: operador lógico, variável, operador de comparação, string.\n\nEsta regra é executada se a URL acessada for igual a string `mypagetotest.com/home`.\n\n### Definição de behaviors (comportamentos) de validação\n\nAdicione os *behaviors* (comportamentos) que você deseja que sejam executados quando as condições da regra forem cumpridas, como no exemplo a seguir:\n\n`Then`: **Run Function** e escolha **MyABTestFunction**\n\n> Lógica: operador lógico, ação, função.\n\nNeste exemplo, se as condições definidas nas regras forem satisfeitas, a função **MyMassiveRedirect** será executada.\n\nFinalmente, salve sua edge application e a sua função estará pronta.\n\n",

    "body": "\n**Azion Secure Token** é uma solução *serverless* disponível no **Marketplace da Azion**.\n\nEssa solução permite processar e validar tokens que podem ser usados para controlar o acesso a conteúdo restrito ou personalizado, tais como aulas, vídeos e imagens. Apesar do fato do acesso a esse conteúdo ser concedido através de interfaces que exigem autenticação do usuário, é possível visualizar esses arquivos diretamente inserindo sua URL, o que os torna simples de distribuir. Neste caso, usando a solução **Secure Token**, o acesso só é concedido após o token ter sido validado, mesmo que uma URL seja compartilhada.\n\nOutros benefícios do **Secure Token** incluem:\n\n1. Flexibilidade no desenvolvimento de aplicações.\n2. Infraestrutura descentralizada do edge para processar os tokens.\n3. Capacidade de aplicar regras de negócios no edge.\n\n---\n\n## Como funciona a solução Secure Token?\n\nAo implementar controles de acesso com a solução **Secure Token**, a aplicação de origem e a solução no edge assumem papéis distintos:\n\n- **Aplicação de origem**: determina a lógica em torno de como o token é gerado e também determina como o acesso dos usuários será controlado. Por exemplo, qual método de autenticação (OAUTH, OpenID Connect, etc.) será usado. O Token é um hash da URL, cujo conteúdo está sendo solicitado. Ele inclui um período de expiração para o próprio token e uma chave secreta.\n\n- **Secure Token**: valida o token gerado pelo aplicativo para cada solicitação recebida e enviada pelo usuário. Se o token tiver expirado, a chave secreta não estiver correta ou o token não for válido para a URL em questão, o acesso ao conteúdo será negado.\n\nTambém é possível combiná-los com outros elementos no para definir qual comportamento deve ser aplicado (autorizar o acesso ou encaminhar para a aplicação, geralmente uma página de login/inscrição).\n\n---\n\n## Instalando a solução Secure Token\n\nA solução **Secure Token** está disponível no Marketplace da Azion. Pode ser acessada através do [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/) selecionando **Products menu**, identificado pelas três linhas horizontais no canto superior esquerdo, e depois **Marketplace**.\n\n> Para acessar o RTM, você deve ter uma conta na Azion.

Os cookies são criados para esta tarefa usando funções JavaScript (com processamento do lado do cliente) ou funções no backend da aplicação (com processamento do lado do servidor), que instruem a aplicação de gerenciamento de conteúdo a entregar conteúdo distinto para cada grupo de usuários.\n\nÉ possível criar, avaliar e executar a variação destes cookies diretamente no edge, usando funções *serverless* e edge computing. Estas ações, quando feitas no edge, melhoram a experiência do cliente, o desempenho da aplicação, a assertividade da distribuição e o custo operacional geral, eliminando a necessidade de um fluxo de processamento adicional.\n\n---\n\n## Segmentação de conteúdo utilizando a solução Content Targeting do Marketplace da Azion\n\n**Content Targeting** é uma solução *serverless* disponível no Marketplace da Azion. Esta solução permite criar e manipular cookies para lógicas de uso flexíveis, tais como segmentação de conteúdo ou manipulação de contextos específicos de aplicação, regras de negócios ou qualquer outro cenário que o cliente deseje avaliar. Nesse caso, para utilizar essas funcionalidades, você pode criar diferentes cenários, especificando variantes e porcentagens de distribuição para cada cenário, com maior assertividade e sem sobrecarregar recursos e interações na fonte. Você também pode usar a lógica de processamento no edge, ampliando a aplicabilidade da função e obtendo vários benefícios, como por exemplo:\n\n- Cache direcionado.\n- Pico de absorção de acesso.\n- Alto desempenho.\n- Lógica de processamento distribuída.\n- Registro de eventos através de fluxo de dados.\n\n---\n\n## Como funciona a solução de Content Targeting do Marketplace da Azion?\n\nQuando uma solicitação chega ao edge, o algoritmo a distribui com base na probabilidade definida e um cookie é estabelecido com o tempo de expiração e os valores fornecidos para cada variante.

Este tipo de solução é utilizada principalmente para proteger seus domínios contra bots, permitindo o monitoramento do tráfego em seu site através do Painel de Controle do site hCaptcha.\n\nO hCaptcha é um serviço CAPTCHA que visa melhorar a privacidade e a segurança dos usuários usando quebra-cabeças mais difíceis de serem resolvidos pelos bots. Os quebra-cabeças resolvidos são usados posteriormente para treinar modelos de aprendizagem de máquina para melhorar a segurança geral da internet. \n\nO hCaptcha também permite aos proprietários de sites ganhar dinheiro exibindo esse tipo de quebra-cabeças para seus usuários.\n\n---\n\n## Obtendo a solução\n\nPara usar a solução hCaptcha fornecida no Marketplace da Azion, você deve seguir os próximos passos:\n\n1. Entrar na sua conta da Azion no [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).\n    - Se você ainda não tiver uma, [crie uma conta](https://manager.azion.com/signup/) visitando a página de cadastro.\n2. No canto superior esquerdo da página, selecione **Products menu** > **Marketplace**.\n3. Selecione a caixa de busca e digite \"*hcaptcha*\" ou navegue pelos cards para encontrar a solução hCaptcha.\n4. Depois de encontrar o card hCaptcha, selecione-o para ir para a página da solução.\n5. Na página da solução, procure a seção **Subscribe for** no canto inferior direito.\n6. Clique no botão **Get It Now**.\n\n> Você verá uma mensagem indicando que sua solução foi instalada com sucesso e está pronta para ser usada.\n\n---\n\n## Obtendo as credenciais no site hCaptcha\n\nPara usar a solução hCaptcha, você deve fornecer duas chaves: sua secret-key e sua site-key. Para obter estas credenciais, você terá que se registrar no site hCaptcha. \n\nPara realizar isto, siga estes passos:\n\n1. Vá para o [painel de controle do site hCaptcha](https://dashboard.hcaptcha.com/overview).\n    - Se você não tiver uma conta, [você pode criar uma aqui](https://www.hcaptcha.com/signup-interstitial).\n    - Atente-se ao criar uma nova conta, pois o site fornecerá sua secret-key. Esta secret-key será usada para configurar a solução mais tarde.\n2. No painel de controle, clique no botão **New Site**.\n3. É opcional, mas indicado, nomeá-la como sua instância de hCaptcha.\n4. Preencha os `hostnames` nos quais você deseja usar o desafio e clique no botão **Add Domain**.\n5. Escolha seu modo de desafio:\n    - Você tem três opções aqui: **Always Challenge** (grátis), **Passive** (pago) e **99.9% Passive** (pago). A diferença entre os três modelos é a heurística aplicada em cada acesso; para o modo *Passive*, não há desafio e o CAPTCHA será acionado de acordo com o comportamento do usuário. Já no modelo *99,9% Passive*, o desafio só aparecerá para usuários com alto risco de serem bots. Por fim, para o modelo *grátis*, onde apenas o modo Always Challenge está disponível, cada pedido carregará um desafio.\n6. Escolha o limiar de passagem desejado para seu site, de acordo com o nível de dificuldade: *auto (automático)*, *easy (fácil)*, *moderate (moderado)* e *difficult (difícil)*. Estes modos determinarão quão precisas as respostas do usuário devem ser para passar no teste.\n7. Com tudo preenchido, clique no botão **Save** no canto superior direito.\n\nAgora você tem seu site configurado para usar a solução hCaptcha. Para configurar nossa solução, ainda temos que obter a site key do hCaptcha. \n\nPara isso, siga os passos:\n\n1. No painel de controle, no menu superior, clique em **Sites**.\n2. Após carregar a tela com seus sites, escolha o que você configurou acima.\n3. Clique no botão **Settings**, com o símbolo da engrenagem.\n4. Você verá um campo de texto com uma cadeia de caracteres que terá este aspecto:\n    - `efdb42c7-10ee-4969-8013-cfcb5f7ad007`. Esta é a sua site key.\n5. Você pode clicar no botão **Try Out** para ver se tudo está funcionando.\n6.

Ainda na página **Edge Application**, selecione a aba **Functions** localizada na lista superior.\n2. Clique no botão **Add Function**.\n3. Escolha um nome fácil de lembrar para a sua função.\n4. No menu suspenso de funções, selecione a função **IP Address Reputation**.\n    - Isto irá carregar a função, mostrando uma caixa com o código da função e, logo acima, duas abas: **Code** e **Args**.\n\n> Se você clicar na aba **Code**, será possível navegar pelo código para se familiarizar com ele, mas sem alterá-lo.\n\nNa aba **Args**, você mudará a configuração de edge function IP Address Reputation. Para isso, selecione a aba **Args** para abrir a caixa de **Args**. Aqui, você pode adicionar os parâmetros para executar sua aplicação. Na aba **Args** você verá o arquivo `JSON` que você tem que editar para utilizar a solução. \n\nO `JSON` terá este aspecto:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"api_key\": \"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\",\n  \"allow_public_access_points\": true,\n  \"fast\": true,\n  \"strictness\": 0,\n  \"lighter_penalties\": true,\n  \"user_language\": \"en-US\",\n  \"transaction_strictness\": 0\n}\n```\n\nPara executar a solução, o único parâmetro que você precisará configurar é a `api_key`, passando a chave API que você recebeu por email.\n\nOs outros campos são:\n\n- `allow_public_access_points`: permite conexões públicas. O valor é um booleano, com o valor padrão sendo `true`.\n- `fast`: habilita uma verificação rápida. Quando você habilita este parâmetro, sua API não faz algumas verificações forenses. O valor é um booleano, com o valor padrão sendo `true`.\n- `strictness`: é o Fraud Scoring, valores mais altos (acima de 2) têm mais chances de retornar falsos positivos. Use o intervalo 0-3 para evitar este comportamento. O valor é um número inteiro, com o valor padrão sendo 0.\n- `lighter_penalties`: reduz a pontuação para endereços IP sob um proxy, evitando falsos positivos. O valor é um booleano, com o valor padrão sendo `true`.\n- `user_language`: o idioma do cabeçalho do usuário. O valor é uma string, sem valor padrão.\n- `transaction_strictness`: ajusta os pesos das penalidades para irregularidades e padrões de fraude detectados. Este recurso só é útil quando são fornecidos detalhes de pedidos e transações. O valor é um número inteiro, sem valor padrão.\n\nAlguns outros parâmetros, que não estão no exemplo `JSON` fornecido na caixa Args, podem ser utilizados. \n\nEles são:\n\n- `when_score_above`: estabelece um limiar de pontuação. Sempre que o IPQS Risk Score exceder este limite, a função executará a ação definida pelo argumento `execute`. Se o valor não for definido, nenhuma ação será tomada pela função. O valor é um número inteiro, sem valor padrão.\n- `execute`: a ação que será executada quando o limiar de pontuação for ultrapassado. O valor é uma string, que aceita três possibilidades: `deny`, `drop`, `add_header`. Não existe um valor padrão.\n- `get_data_from`: determina se o IP será recuperado por uma querystring request do header ou do body. Se o valor for `remote_addr`, o valor a ser extraído será: `ngx.var.remote_addr`. O valor é uma string com quatro possibilidades: `remote_addr`, `querystring`, `body`, `header`. O valor padrão é `remote_addr`.\n- `data_name`: identifica o campo ou argumento de onde a função IPQS irá extrair o IP para validar. Este parâmetro só é usado se o parâmetro `search_in` é diferente de `remote_addr`. O valor é uma string, com o valor padrão sendo `X-Forwarded-For`.\n\n---\n\n## Definindo uma regra para o Rules Engine\n\nAinda na página de **Edge Application**, na aba **Rules Engine**, você deve configurar as regras (*criteria* e *behavior*) que deseja aplicar a fim de executar sua função.\n\nPara fazer isso, siga estes passos:\n\n1. Na página **Edge Application**, selecione a aba **Rules Engine**.\n2. Clique em **Default Rule**.\n3. No campo *behavior*, selecione **Run Function** no menu suspenso e depois selecione a opção **IP Address Reputation**, de acordo com o nome que você deu na etapa de instanciação.\n\n> Nota: você não pode alterar o campo de criteria para a Default Rule.\n\n4. Clique no botão **Save**.\n\n---\n\n#### Importante\n\nÉ uma boa prática criar outra regra, redirecionando sua aplicação para outra URL, porque, se a solução IP Address Reputation não encontrar erros, você não verá nenhuma mensagem. Se você não quiser ou precisar, você pode acompanhar o uso de sua chave API através do painel da IPQualityScore. Cada atualização em sua aplicação no edge contará como um novo pedido de busca de endereço IP. Note também que, para cada campo presente nos resultados, a solução adiciona o prefixo `IPQS` ao cabeçalho da solicitação. Isto significa que para cada consulta, o cabeçalho terá um prefixo com o campo. Por exemplo, se a solicitação tiver um campo `ASN`, o cabeçalho terá um cabeçalho com o prefixo `IPQS-ASN` com o mesmo valor. Você também pode utilizar estas informações para criar e gerenciar suas decisões no Rules Engine. Você pode encontrar uma [lista completa destes campos aqui](https://www.ipqualityscore.com/documentation/proxy-detection/overview).\n\n\n",

    "body": "\nA solução JWT da Azion é uma solução *serverless* oferecida através do Marketplace.\n\nTokens de acesso são frequentemente usados para controlar o acesso a recursos online, como APIs e arquivos de mídia. Os JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) podem ser usados para simplificar esse processo. No entanto, os JWTs podem ser maiores do que os IDs de sessão, o que pode afetar a velocidade da rede. Você pode resolver esses problemas usando edge computing.\n\nA Azion oferece uma solução para aumentar a segurança: a solução JWT Edge é executada diretamente no edge firewall. Essa solução permite que você conceda e revogue privilégios usando *KIDs* e *secrets*, e que também defina datas de expiração. A sua execução no edge adiciona uma camada de segurança, pois verifica a autenticidade antes de chegar à infraestrutura, sem a necessidade de entrar em contato com um servidor autenticador, o que acelera o processo.\n\n---\n\n## Obtendo a solução\n\nPara usar a solução JWT da Azion, você deve proceder até o Marketplace.

    "body": "\n\nA edge function **Massive Redirect** é uma solução *serverless* disponível no Azion Marketplace. Ela é projetada para lidar com um grande número de redirecionamentos e pode ser usada quando um grande número de endereços precisa ser alterado, como, por exemplo, ao migrar domínios.\n\nAo centralizar o gerenciamento de várias configurações em um só lugar, esta solução permite que você controle redirecionamentos diretamente no edge. Dessa forma, você pode lidar com diferentes situações, como migrações de CMS, plataformas de comércio eletrônico e atualizações de sites.\n\nAlguns dos outros benefícios de usar a solução Massive Redirect para migração de domínio incluem:\n\n1. Gerenciamento de vários redirecionamentos de forma centralizada. Não há necessidade de criar uma regra para a request phase para cada redirecionamento.\n2. Redução do impacto negativo no SEO.\n3. Redução do risco de classificação do mecanismo de pesquisa para as páginas afetadas.\n4. Processamento no edge, liberando recursos da infraestrutura de origem.\n\n---\n\n## Como funciona a solução Massive Redirect\n\nA função lida com o redirecionamento do tráfego de acordo com as configurações especificadas pelos parâmetros, **Args**, e pelos critérios de validação definidos dentro do **Rules Engine** da edge application.\n\nQuando um pedido para um endereço, configurado nos parâmetros, atinge qualquer um dos edge nodes da Azion, a função identifica que ele precisa de redirecionamento e o redireciona para o novo endereço. A aplicação de origem recebe a solicitação e retorna o conteúdo para o edge node enviar de volta ao usuário com o status HTTP apropriado: 301 ou 302, dependendo da configuração.\n\nO redirecionamento que a função precisa executar é definido usando uma lista de parâmetros no formato `JSON`, consistindo de pares contendo o endereço antigo e o endereço de destino (**Args**), conforme mostrado aqui:\n\n- `endereço antigo`: pode ser listado de forma exata ou usando uma expressão regular conforme as opções abaixo:\n   - `from`: endereço completo.\n   - `from_regex`: expressão regular para representar um formato de URL padrão, permitindo que você configure mais de um endereço usando uma única regra. Essas expressões devem estar na forma padrão Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (*PCRE*).\n- `endereço de destino`: pode ser escrito de duas maneiras:\n   - `moved`: destino (URL) que será redirecionado permanentemente (status HTTP 301).\n   - `found`: destino (URL) que será redirecionado temporariamente (status HTTP 302).\n\nPortanto, a configuração de uma lista de redirecionamentos teria o seguinte formato:\n\n```json\n[{\n   \"from\": \"https://www.old-site.com/\",\n   \"moved\": \"https://www.new-site.com\"\n},\n{\n    \"from\": \"https://www.old-site.com/shoes-snekears.html\",\n    \"moved\": \"https://www.new-site.com/category/shoes/sneakers\"\n},\n{\n    \"from\": \"https://www.old-site.com/users-login.html\",\n    \"found\": \"https://www.new-site.com/login.html\"\n},\n{\n    \"from_regex\": \"https://(api|store|checkout)\\\\.old-site\\\\.com$\",\n    \"moved\": \"https://www.new-site.com/%1$\"\n}]\n```\n\n---\n\n## Lista com vários redirecionamentos em uma única configuração Args\n\nCom base nas informações contidas nos **Args**, a função realizará uma interpretação de endereços e redirecionamentos, como veremos em detalhes a seguir.\n\n## Configurando a função Massive Redirect\n\nA edge function Massive Redirect está disponível no Azion Marketplace. Para acessá-la, você pode fazer através do [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/), no **Products menu**, localizado no canto superior esquerdo e representado pelas três linhas horizontais.\n\nA função só pode ser executada quando tiver sido **instanciada** na edge application que você pretende usar, e quando os criteria (*critérios*) e behaviors (*comportamentos*) de ativação tiverem sido definidos no **Rules Engine**.\n\n---\n\n## Criando uma instância\n\nPara criar uma função Massive Redirect, você pode consultar o guia sobre [como instalar a solution Massive Redirect através do Marketplace da Azion](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/how-to-redirecionamento-massivo/).\n\n---\n\n## Definindo os criteria (critérios) de execução no Rules Engine\n\nAs regras (no Rules Engine) determinam o conjunto de condições que precisam ser atendidas para que os *behaviors* (comportamentos) sejam executados. Você pode usar a Default Rule ou criar uma nova regra para definir os parâmetros para validação e os *behaviors* (comportamentos) que a edge application executará.\n\n### Definição de criteria (critérios) de validação\n\nEscolha as *variáveis*, *operadores de comparação* e *strings* para criar sua regra de negócio, como no exemplo abaixo:\n\n`if: ${domain} is equal old-site.com`\n\n> Lógica: operador lógico, variável, operador de comparação, string.\n\nNeste exemplo, se o domínio acessado for o mesmo que a string `old-site.com`, a regra será executada.\n\n### Definição de behaviors (comportamentos)\n\nAdicione os *behaviors* (comportamentos) que você deseja que sejam realizados quando as condições da regra forem atendidas, como no exemplo abaixo:\n\n`Then Run Function` e escolha **MyMassiveRedirect**, ou qualquer outro nome que você deu para a sua função.\n\n> Lógica: operador lógico, ação, função.\n\nNeste exemplo, se as condições definidas nas regras forem satisfeitas, a função **MyMassiveRedirect** será executada.\n\nPor fim, salve suas configurações e sua edge application estará pronta para executar esta nova função.\n\n",

    "body": "\nA edge function JWT é uma solução *serverless* do Azion Marketplace para processar e validar tokens JWT (*JSON Web Token*). Ela pode ser usada para criar soluções de paywall que permitam controlar o acesso a conteúdo por assinatura.\n\nCom esse sistema, a aplicação otimiza as operações e reduz a carga de processamento na infraestrutura do cliente, identificando diretamente no edge se a pessoa que tenta acessar uma determinada página está autorizada ou não.\n\nAlguns outros benefícios da solução JWT são:\n\n1. Fornece flexibilidade de desenvolvimento de aplicativos para o cliente.\n2. Processa os tokens em uma infraestrutura distribuída de edge nodes.\n3. Proporciona capacidade de execução de regras de negócios no edge.\n\n---\n\n## Como funciona a solução JWT\n\nEm uma implementação de paywall utilizando a solução JWT, a aplicação de origem e a função no edge têm papéis diferentes:\n\n**Aplicação de origem**: determina a lógica em torno de como o token é gerado e quando ele irá expirar. Também determina como o acesso do usuário é controlado, como qual método de autenticação é usado (OAUTH, OpenID Connect, etc.), o número de tentativas de acesso ou bytes que o cliente pode usar antes de ser solicitado a fazer login ou a quantidade de tempo que o cliente pode navegar sem autorização adicional (expiração).\n\nO token usa um padrão da indústria para autenticação HTTP, o **Bearer Authentication Scheme (Esquema de Autenticação de Portador)**, que armazena objetos `JSON` com informações de autenticação que devem ser adicionadas ao cabeçalho de cada solicitação.\n\n**Edge⁠Function JWT**: valida o token gerado pelo aplicativo para cada solicitação recebida e enviada pelo usuário. A função segue as regras de negócios definidas no token, e pode combiná-las com outros elementos no edge para definir qual comportamento deve ser aplicado, permitindo acesso ou redirecionamento para o aplicativo, geralmente uma página de logon/login.\n\n---\n\n## Configurando a função JWT\n\nA edge function JWT está disponível no Azion Marketplace e pode ser acessada através do [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/), no **Products menu**, localizado no canto superior esquerdo da página inicial do RTM e indicado pelas três linhas horizontais.\n\nPara ser executada, a função deve ser instanciada em uma edge application. Seus critérios de ativação e comportamento também devem ser definidos dentro do **Rules Engine**, de acordo com a abordagem já configurada no aplicativo de origem (por exemplo, versões proprietárias do OAuth, OpenID, etc., ou versões de mercado, como Auth0, Keycloak, etc.).\n\n---\n\n## Criando uma instância\n\nPara criar uma função JWT, você pode consultar o guia sobre [Como instalar a solution JWT através do Marketplace da Azion](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/jwt/).\n\n**Parâmetros**: uma vez que você selecionou a função JWT em sua edge application, um formulário com o código-fonte aparecerá no campo **Code**, que é apenas para fins informativos e você não pode alterá-lo. Na aba **Args**, você passará a lista de pares de KIDs (*Key IDs*) e as chaves secretas usadas para gerar a assinatura do token e salvar a função.\n\nA lista de pares é definida em sua aplicação de origem, como no exemplo abaixo:\n\n```json\n[{\n\t\"kids\": {\n    \t\"4546D4AA7F62F01A833A7ABE354030E7\": \"D6CB2342E44EFB6DD628276F36DA2359\",\n    \t\"D6CB2342E44EFB6DD628276F36DA2359\": \"60BD8ED7A768E8BD6925BEB0A691AADB\",\n    \t\"60BD8ED7A768E8BD6925BEB0A691AADB\": \"4546D4AA7F62F01A833A7ABE354030E7\"\n  \t}\n}]\n```\n\n---\n\n## Definindo as regras no Rules Engine\n\nAs regras do **Rules Engine** determinarão o conjunto de condições que precisam ser atendidas para que os *behaviors* (comportamentos) sejam executados. Você pode usar a **Default Rule** ou criar uma nova regra.\n\n### Definição dos criteria (critérios) de validação\n\nEscolha as variáveis, os operadores de comparação e as strings para criar sua regra de negócio, como no exemplo a seguir:\n\n`If: ${uri} starts with /news`\n\n> Lógica: operador lógico, variável, operador de comparação, string.\n\nAqui, a regra é executada se uma URL começar com a string `/news`.\n\n### Definição dos behaviors (comportamentos)\n\nAdicione os *behaviors* (comportamentos) que você deseja que sejam realizados quando as condições da regra forem atendidas. Exemplo:\n\n`Then Run Function` e escolha **JWT**, ou qualquer outro nome que você deu para a sua função.\n\n> Lógica: operador lógico, ação, função.\n\nNeste exemplo, se as condições definidas nas regras forem satisfeitas, a função **JWT** será executada.\n\n> **Nota**: um código de erro será retornado se o token recebido for inválido. A função retornará um código de status HTTP 400 ou 401, dependendo do erro.\n\nPor fim, salve sua edge application e a sua função estará pronta.\n\n",

Para isso, o **Marketplace** da Azion precisa de privilégios para ler e escrever suas regras no **Rules Engine**.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Firewall\n\nAlgumas soluções são executadas na instância do **Edge Firewall**. Essas soluções precisam de mais privilégios do que os concedidos a uma edge application. Para conhecer os privilégios de acesso do Edge Firewall, visite o guia [Permissões de acesso para Edge Firewall](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-firewall/permissoes-de-acesso/).\n\n\n",

Ao clicar na aba **Code**, você poderá navegar pelo código, mas não poderá alterá-lo.\n\nComo você tem duas soluções, terá que configurar duas abas **Args**, uma para a *response phase* e outra para a *request phase*.\n\nPara a *response phase*, os Args são:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"cookie_name\": \"azn\",\n    \"cookie_secret\": \"1234567890123456\",\n    \"cookie_max_age\": 45,\n    \"args_list\": [\"http_x_something\", \"http_x_another_thing\",\n    \"request_body_userid\"]\n}\n```\n\n**Onde**:\n`cookie_name`: define o nome do cookie. O valor padrão é `azn`.\n`cookie_secret`: define a chave usada para criptografar o cookie assinado. Devido ao algoritmo de criptografia usado aqui, o AES-128, esta chave deve ter exatamente 16 caracteres.\n`cookie_max_age`: define o tempo de expiração do cookie. Se você não definir nenhum tempo (passando um valor nulo ou nenhum valor), o cookie será um cookie de sessão. O valor padrão é `45`.\n`args_list`: define a lista de variáveis do *Nginx* que serão analisadas na solicitação do usuário. Sempre que essas variáveis mudarem, a contagem de mudanças será aumentada. Esses parâmetros serão usados para bloquear ou permitir o acesso.\n\nPara a *request phase*, os Args são:\n\n```json\n{\n\"cookie_name\": \"azn\",\n\"cookie_secret\": \"1234567890123456\",\n\"max_variation\": 6,\n\"max_unique_variation\": 2\n}\n```\n\n**Onde***:\n\n`cookie_name`: define o nome do cookie. Deve ser o mesmo que foi definido na *response phase*.\n`cookie_secret`: define a chave secreta para o cookie. Deve ser a mesma que foi definida na *response phase*.\n`max_variation`: define o número máximo de qualquer tipo de variação nos parâmetros.\n`max_unique_variation`: define o número máximo de variações únicas nos parâmetros. Esta função descriptografa o cookie assinado e verifica se alguma variante do cookie ocorreu. Caso tenha ocorrido, um novo cabeçalho de solicitação com o nome `[COOKIE_NAME]-[VIOLATION-TYPE)]-[TRUE]` será anexado à request.\n\n### As possíveis violações podem assumir três valores:\n\n- **All variations**: independentemente de haver valores repetidos, conta-se o número de vezes que o valor do cookie foi alterado. Por exemplo, se o valor do cookie mudasse de \"nada\" para \"A\" no primeiro pedido, de \"A\" para \"B\" no segundo, depois para \"C\" no terceiro, então de \"B\" para \"C\" no quarto, de \"B\" para \"A\" no quinto, e finalmente para \"A\" no sexto pedido, o número total de variações seria 5. Se o cookie tiver o nome padrão, o cabeçalho da violação que é adicionado ao pedido quando esta violação ocorre é `http_cookie_name_any_variation_violation`.\n\n- **Unique variations**: conta o número de valores distintos que foram atribuídos ao cookie desde sua criação. Considerando que o cookie só tenha como valores distintos \"A,\" \"B,\" e \"C\", a variação única, usando o mesmo exemplo acima, seria, portanto, 3. assumindo que o cookie tenha o nome padrão, quando esta violação ocorrer, um cabeçalho de violação chamado `http_cookie_name_unique_variation_violation` será adicionado a request.\n\n- **Signature violation***: Quando a função não conseguir decifrar o cookie assinado (por exemplo, porque foi assinado com uma chave diferente ou porque o cookie foi alterado no lado do cliente), esta violação será acionada. Assumindo que o cookie tenha o nome padrão, quando esta violação for acionada, o pedido terá o cabeçalho de violação `http_cookie_name_signature_violation` adicionado a ele.\n\n---\n\n## Configurando o Rules Engine\n\nAinda na página Edge Application, na guia **Rules Engine**, você deverá configurar as regras (*criteria* e *behavior*) que deseja aplicar para executar sua solução.\n\nPrimeiro, você deve configurar a sua **response phase** dentro do **Rules Engine**.\n\nPara fazer isso, siga estes passos:\n\n1. Selecione a guia **Rules Engine**.\n2. Clique no botão **New Rule** e selecione **Response Phase**.\n3. Dê um nome fácil de lembrar à sua regra.\n4. Informe todos os critérios (*criteria*) que você precisa para executar sua solução.\n5. No campo *behavior*, selecione **Run Function** no menu suspenso e então selecione a função **Request Variation Controller - Hash Generator**, de acordo com o nome que você deu na etapa de instanciação.\n6. Clique no botão **Save**.\n\nAgora, você deve configurar a **request phase**.\n\nPara fazer isso, siga estes passos:\n\n1. Selecione a guia **Rules Engine**.\n2. Clique no botão **New Rule** e selecione **Request Phase**.\n3. Dê um nome fácil de lembrar à sua regra.\n4. Informe os critérios (*criteria*) que você precisa para executar sua solução.\n5. No campo *behavior*, selecione **Run Function** no menu suspenso e então selecione a função **Request Variation - Hash Validator**, de acordo com o nome que você deu no passo de instanciação.\n6. Você precisará de um *segundo behavior* para que a solução Request Variation Controller funcione: *Forward Cookies*. Para adicionar este *behavior*, clique no botão `+` e selecione a opção *Forward Cookies* no menu suspenso.\n    - Lembre-se que para poder selecionar esse comportamento, você deve ter o **Application Acceleration** habilitado na sua edge application, conforme descrito na seção 3 deste guia.\n7. Clique no botão **Save**.\n\nPronto. Você instanciou com sucesso suas duas soluções e agora você está protegido contra ataques de bots maliciosos.\n\n\n",

Clique no botão **Save**.\n\nPronto. Agora, a solution Secure Token está em execução para cada solicitação feita ao domínio que você indicou.\n\n> **Importante**: o servidor Azion Nginx, sendo executado no edge, roda duas verificações em tokens: se o tempo atual é maior que o tempo de expiração especificado no token e se a assinatura corresponde à assinatura do token. Se a assinatura for inválida, o Nginx retornará um erro 403 e, se o tempo de expiração for excedido, retornará um erro 410. Usuários mal-intencionados não podem alterar o tempo de expiração do token sem quebrar a assinatura.\n\n---\n\nVocê pode encontrar alguns exemplos de trechos de código no [repositório público GitHub da Azion](https://github.com/aziontech/azion_secure_token) para a solution Secure Token e você pode ler um [caso de uso para esta solution](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/secure-token/) na página de documentação da Azion.\n\n\n",

Por exemplo, se você usar a string `user.name`, a função procurará o campo \"name\" dentro do objeto \"user\" no `body request`. |\n| `connection_args` | Sim | Objeto | Define os dados que serão usados para transmitir os dados da solicitação.<br /><br /><br />A URL na qual os dados serão postados é definida pelo endpoint.<br /><br /><br />Os cabeçalhos especificam quais cabeçalhos serão incluídos na solicitação de busca.<br /><br /><br />Um cabeçalho adicional <br />`Content-Type: application/json`<br /> será usado. |\n| `s3_connection_args` | Não | Objeto | Define os argumentos a serem usados com um bucket S3. |\n| `s3_connection_args.full_host` | Apenas ao usar `s3_connection_args` | String | Define o host completo do bucket S3. |\n| `s3_connection_args.region` | Apenas ao usar <br />`s3_connection_args` | String | Define a região do bucket S3. |\n| `s3_connection_args.access_key` | Apenas ao usar <br />`s3_connection_args` | String | Define a chave de acesso usada para conectar-se com o bucket S3. |\n| `s3_connection_args.secret_key` | Apenas ao usar <br />`s3_connection_args` | String | Define uma chave secreta para ser usada na conexão com o bucket S3. |\n| `s3_connection_args.file_path` | Não | String | Define o caminho do arquivo criado para armazenar a função.<br />Valor padrão: `/` |\n| `s3_connection_args.use_date_prefix` | Não | String | Quando habilitado, incluirá uma sub-pasta com a data atual (no formato YYYY-MM-DD) para o caminho do arquivo.<br />Valor padrão: `true` |\n\nEsta solução retornará uma resposta com os dados transmitidos em um arquivo `JSON` com a seguinte aparência:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"body\": {\n\t\"field_a\": <data>,\n\t...\n  },\n  \"geoip_asn\": <data>,\n  \"geoip_city\": <data>,\n  \"geoip_city_continent_code\": <data>,\n  \"geoip_city_country_code\": <data>,\n  \"geoip_city_country_name\": <data>,\n  \"geoip_continent_code\": <data>,\n  \"geoip_country_code\": <data>,\n  \"geoip_country_name\": <data>,\n  \"geoip_region\": <data>,\n  \"geoip_region_name\": <data>,\n  \"headers\": {\n\t\"x-header-a\": <data>,\n\t...\n  },\n  \"remote_addr\": <data>,\n  \"remote_port\": <data>,\n  \"remote_user\": <data>,\n  \"request_id\": <data>,\n  \"request_url\": <data>,\n  \"server_protocol\": <data>,\n  \"ssl_cipher\": <data>,\n  \"ssl_protocol\": <data>\n}\n```\n\nObserve como os campos `request_id`, `request_url` e metadados serão entregues na raiz do arquivo `JSON`, enquanto os campos body e os cabeçalhos da solicitação serão enviados nos objetos.\n\n**Importante**: você também pode usar um arquivo `JSON` \"catch-all\" para as Args, como este:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"connection_args\": {\n        \"endpoint\": \"http://example_api:3000/test\",\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Saída dos arquivos S3\n\nPara cada nova execução da função, um novo arquivo será gerado no bucket S3 fornecido. O arquivo será nomeado com base no ID da solicitação que iniciou a função.\n\nExemplo: se o parâmetro `connection_args.file_path` estiver definido como `/meus-dados/` e a função for executada em 9 de maio de 2023, com o ID da solicitação `abcd-1234`, o arquivo resultante será salvo em `/meus-dados/2023-05-09/abcd-1234.json`. Se o parâmetro `connection_args.use_date_prefix` estiver definido como `false`, o arquivo resultante será salvo como `/meus-dados/abcd-1234.json`.\n\nSe não forem fornecidos `http_connection_args` ou `s3_connection_args` nos argumentos JSON, a função não terá nenhum argumento de conexão válido para utilizar. A solicitação será encerrada e uma mensagem de erro em formato JSON será enviada para indicar a causa do problema.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": \"A001\",\n  \"detail\": \"The function instance is missing or has invalid required arguments.\"\n}\n```\n\nSe a função não conseguir se conectar ao endpoint HTTP ou ao provedor S3, a solicitação do usuário será ignorada. Independentemente disso, um registro de erro será criado, ao qual o cliente poderá ter acesso por meio do Data Streaming.\n\nPor exemplo, se uma chave de acesso inválida for usada, será exibido o seguinte aviso:\n\n```json\n[Send event to endpoint] S3 connection error; \n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" standalone=\"yes\"?>\n<Error>\n\t<Code>InvalidAccessKeyId</Code>\n\t<Message>The key 'DAKEY' is not valid</Message>\n</Error>\n```\n\nPor fim, se você fornecer as opções de conexão corretas tanto para o endpoint HTTP quanto para o bucket S3, a função entregará os dados do evento para ambas as fontes simultaneamente.\n\n---\n\n## Configurando o Rules Engine\n\nPara concluir, você precisa configurar o **Rules Engine** para definir o *comportamento* e os *critérios* para executar a solução.\n\nAinda na página **Edge Firewall**, selecione a aba **Rules Engine** e siga estes passos:\n\n1. Clique no botão **New Rule**.\n2. Dê um nome fácil de lembrar à sua nova regra.\n3. Selecione um *criterio (criteria)* para executar a solution. Por exemplo: `if Hostname is equal xxxxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/classes`.\n4. Abaixo, selecione um *comportamento* para os *criteria*. Neste caso, será **Run Function**. Em seguida, selecione a função **Send Event to Endpoint** de acordo com o nome que você deu a ela na etapa instanciada.\n\nPronto. Agora, a solução **Send Event to Endpoint** está sendo executada para cada solicitação feita ao domínio indicado.\n\n\n",

Esta fila é uma estrutura de dados que armazena mensagens na ordem \"*primeiro a entrar, primeiro a sair*\" (*FIFO*, em inglês). As mensagens são adicionadas na parte de trás da fila e removidas da parte da frente. As mensagens podem ser enviadas de forma assíncrona e processadas pelo componente receptor posteriormente, facilitando a comunicação entre diferentes partes de um sistema.\n\n---\n\n## Obtendo a solução\n\nPara obter a solução Send messages to a queue fornecida pelo Marketplace, siga esses passos:\n\n1. Acesse sua conta no [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).\n    - Se você não tiver uma, [crie uma conta](https://manager.azion.com/signup/) visitando a página de cadastro.\n2. No canto superior esquerdo da página, selecione **Products menu** > **Marketplace**.\n3. Na caixa de busca **Explore for Solutions**, digite “*message*” ou navegue pelos cards para encontrar a solução Send messages to a queue.\n4. Selecione o card Send messages to a queue. Você será redirecionado para a página da solução.\n5. Na seção **Subscribe for**, localizada no canto inferior direito da tela, clique no botão **Get It Now**.\n\n> Nota: uma mensagem indica que a solução foi instalada com sucesso.\n\n---\n\n## Usando a solução\n\nA solução obtida no **Marketplace** é adicionada à sua lista de **Edge Functions**. Portanto, para usar a solução Send messages to a queue, você deverá selecionar uma edge application para incorporar a nova função.\n\nPara essa tarefa, você tem diversos modos de ação. Os principais são:\n\n- Visitar a [documentação de ponto de partida](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/ponto-de-partida/) para criar uma edge application. \n- Criar uma edge application no **RTM** selecionando **Products menu** > **Edge Application** e seguir as instruções.\n- Utilizar uma edge application já existente.\n\n---\n\n## Configurando a solução\n\nApós obter uma solução no **Marketplace**, é preciso configurá-la.\n\nPara configurar a solução Send messages to a queue, complete os seguintes passos:\n\n1. Acesse o [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).\n2. No canto superior esquerdo da página, selecione **Products Menu** > **Edge Application**.\n3. Na lista de aplicações, selecione a edge application na qual deseja configurar a solução Send messages to a queue.\n4. Certifique-se de habilitar o interruptor **Edge Functions** na página principal da sua **edge application** para permitir o uso da sua nova solução.\n5. Clique no botão **Save** no canto inferior direito da página.\n\n> Nota: aparecerá uma mensagem indicando que a edge application foi atualizada com sucesso.\n\nIsto ativará a guia **Functions** em sua edge application. Agora você será capaz de instanciar uma edge function Send messages to a queue em sua edge application.\n\n---\n\n## Instanciando a solução\n\nPara instanciar uma solução Send messages to a queue, siga os passos abaixo:\n\n1. Na lista superior, selecione a aba **Functions**.\n2. Clique no botão **Add Function**.\n3. Escolha um nome fácil de lembrar para a sua função.\n4. No menu suspenso de funções, selecione a função Send messages to a queue.\n\nIsto irá carregar o código-fonte da função referente à solução Send messages to a queue. Logo acima, você terá duas abas: **Code** e **Args**. Se você clicar na aba **Code**, será possível navegar pelo código-fonte, mas sem alterá-lo. \n\nA configuração de sua função estará na aba **Args**. \n\nClique na aba **Args** para editar o arquivo de configuração no formato `JSON`, no qual você passará os parâmetros para executar sua aplicação.\n\nVocê pode configurar três serviços de mensageria: *RabbitMQ*, *Amazon SQS* e *Kafka-REST*. Para cada uma destas soluções, você terá parâmetros diferentes e credenciais diferentes, como mostrado nos exemplos abaixo:\n\n### AMQP:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"server_type\": \"amqp\",\n  \"connection_url\": \"https://my-service.azion.com/queue\",\n  \"connection_authorization\": \"Basic my_basic_auth\",\n  \"connection_args: {\n   \"routing_key: \"my_queue\",\n   \"payload: \"my_custom_payload\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### SQS:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"server_type\": \"sqs\",\n  \"connection_url\": \"https://my-service.azion.com/sqs-queue\",\n  \"connection_authorization\": \"Basic my_basic_auth\",\n  \"connection_args: {\n    \"auth_params: \"my_aditional_auth_params\",\n     \"version\": \"2012-11-05\",\n    \"expires\": \"Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Kafka-REST:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"server_type\": \"kafka-rest\",\n  \"connection_url\": \"https://my-service.azion.com/topics/my-topic\",\n \"connection_args: {\n    \"payload\": \"my_custom_payload\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Onde**:\n- `server_type`: define o tipo de conexão utilizada (`amqp`, `sqs`, `kafka-rest` são os três valores possíveis).\n- `connection_url`: define a URL do servidor do serviço que você escolher.\n- `connection_authorization`: o tipo de autorização necessária para a conexão. Este é um campo *opcional*.\n\nVocê também pode definir parâmetros adicionais para sua fila, passando-os na seção `connection_args`. Cada serviço suportado tem parâmetros adicionais diferentes que podem ser utilizados. Estes **não** são obrigatórios para que a sua função rode no edge.\n\n> **Importante**: não é possível integrar o Kafka **\"as is\"** porque os clientes Kafka disponíveis para JavaScript (Kafka JS e Kafka Node) utilizam funcionalidades do NodeJS que são incompatíveis com o **Azion Cells**. Entretanto, você tem a opção de integrá-lo usando o Kafka-REST, um módulo que fornece uma interface HTTP RESTful para um cluster Kafka.\n\nPara finalizar, clique no botão **Save**.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Definindo uma regra para o Rules Engine\n\nAinda na página de **Edge Application**, na guia **Rules Engine**, você tem que configurar as regras que deseja (*criteria* e *behavior*) aplicar a fim de executar sua função.\n\nPara fazer isso, siga estes passos:\n\n1. Selecione a aba **Rules Engine**.\n2. Clique em **Default Rule**.\n    - Você não pode alterar o campo de *criteria* no **Rules Engine** para a **Default Rule**.\n3. No campo *behavior*, selecione **Run Function** no menu suspenso e depois selecione a opção **Send messages to a queue**, de acordo com o nome que você deu na etapa de instanciação.\n4. Clique no botão **Save**.\n\nPronto. Agora você tem a sua função funcionando no edge.\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n**Signed Cookies** é uma solução *serverless*, dividida em duas partes, disponível no Marketplace da Azion.\n\nOs cookies assinados são um tipo de cookie que tem uma camada extra de segurança. A assinatura de cookies significa que as informações que eles contêm são criptografadas e só podem ser lidas pelo site que os criou. Os cookies assinados são frequentemente usados para fins de autenticação. Por exemplo, para lembrar se um usuário fez login em um site. Isso permite que o site verifique se terceiros não interferiram ou alteraram os dados da sessão. Esta é uma defesa eficaz contra sequestro de sessão e outros ataques de segurança.\n\nOs cookies assinados podem incluir um carimbo de data/hora ou data de validade, além de criptografia. Isso garante que os dados sejam válidos apenas por um tempo limitado. Em suma, os cookies assinados são uma ferramenta vital para os desenvolvedores web manterem a segurança e a integridade dos dados do usuário.\n\n---\n\n## Obtendo a solução\n\nLembre-se de que essa solução é, na verdade, duas. A solução Signed Cookies é dividida em Hash Generator e Hash Validator.\n\nPara instalar esta solução, siga estas etapas:\n\n1. Faça login na sua [conta do Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).\n   - Se você não tem uma conta, você pode [criar uma aqui](https://sso.azion.com/).\n2. No canto superior esquerdo da página, selecione **Products⁠ menu** > **Marketplace**.\n3. Selecione a caixa de pesquisa e digite \"*signed cookies*\" ou navegue pelos cards para encontrar as duas soluções Signed Cookies.\n3. Depois de encontrar os cards referentes à solução Signed Cookies (*Hash Generator* e *Hash Validator*) selecione um para ser direcionado para a página da solução.\n4. Na página da solução, procure a seção **Subscribe for** no canto inferior direito.\n5. Clique no botão **Get it now**.\n\nVocê seguirá as mesmas etapas para instalar a segunda parte da solução, alterando apenas o nome da solução na busca ou qual você vai procurar manualmente pela página.\n\n> Em ambos os casos, depois de clicar no botão **Get it now**, você verá uma mensagem indicando que sua solução foi instalada com sucesso e está pronta para uso.\n\n---\n\n## Usando a solução\n\nA solução obtida no Marketplace é adicionada à sua lista de edge functions. Portanto, para usá-la, você deve criar uma nova edge application e incorporar a nova função.\n\nPara esta tarefa você tem vários modos de ação, os principais são:\n\n- Visite a documentação do [ponto de partida](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/ponto-de-partida/).\n- Crie uma edge application no **RTM** selecionando **Products menu** > **Edge Application** e siga as instruções.\n- Use uma edge application já existente.\n\n---\n\n## Configurando a solução\n\nPara configurar sua solução, proceda da seguinte forma:\n\n1. No canto superior esquerdo, selecione **Products menu** > **Edge Application** na seção de **BUILD**.\n2. Na página de listagem de suas edge applications, selecione aquela que você criou para usar com a solução Signed Cookies.\n3. Na aba **Main Settings**, sob a seção **Modules**, localize a opção **Edge Functions** e ative-a para habilitar o uso de **Functions** em sua edge application.\n4. Ainda sob **Modules**, localize a opção **Application Acceleration** e ative-a para habilitar a funcionalidade **Forward Cookies** para a sua aplicação. Essa necessidade será abordada na [seção Rules Engine](#rules-engine).\n4. Clique no botão **Save**.\n\n> Você receberá uma mensagem de sucesso indicando que sua edge application foi atualizada.\n\n---\n\n## Instanciando a solução\n\nPara habilitar essa função, enquanto ainda estiver na página **Edge Application**:\n\n1. Selecione a guia **Functions** na lista superior.\n2. Clique no botão **Add ⁠Function**.\n3. Escolha um nome fácil de lembrar para sua função.\n4. No menu suspenso, selecione a função **Signed Cookies**.\n\nEsta ação carregará a função, mostrando um formulário com o código-fonte desta e, logo acima dele, duas abas: **Code** e **Args**. Ao clicar na aba **Code**, você poderá navegar pelo código-fonte, mas não alterá-lo.\n\n> Como você tem duas soluções, você deverá configurar duas vezes a aba **Args**, uma para a hash generator e outra hash validator.\n\n> Lembre-se de que a solução Signed Cookies é dividida em duas e que **Hash Generator deve ser executado na response phase** e **Hash ⁠Validator deve ser executado na request phase**.\n\nPara **Hash ⁠Generator**, os **Args** são:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"cookie_list\": [\"yummy_cookie\", \"tasty_cookie\"],\n  \"cookie_secret\": \"ItIsASecret\",\n  \"tampering_cookie_prefix\": \"tampering_protection\"\n}\n```\n\n**Onde**:\n- `cookie_list`: define a lista de cookies que devem ser protegidos. Para cada cookie nesta lista, uma versão criptografada do cookie será anexada à resposta.\n- `cookie_secret`: uma senha para proteger o cookie criptografado contra a manipulação do lado do cliente.\n- `tampering_cookie_prefix`: define o prefixo a ser usado no nome dos cookies criptografados.\n\nVocê deve prestar atenção aos possíveis valores adicionados ao campo `tampering_cookie_prefix`.\n\nPor exemplo, se o valor deste argumento for `tampering_protection` e a função for proteger os cookies `yummy_cookie` e `tasty_cookie`, os cookies criptografados criados pela função serão nomeados `tampering_protection_yummy_cookie` e `tampering_protection_tasty_cookie`.\n\nSe esse argumento não tiver um valor válido, o valor padrão chamado, `azion_tampering`, será usado. Portanto, neste caso, os cookies criptografados seriam `azion_tampering_yummy_cookie` e `azion_tampering_tasty_cookie`.\n\nPara **Hash Validator**, os **Args** são:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"cookie_list\": [\"yummy_cookie\", \"tasty_cookie\"],\n  \"cookie_secret\": \"ItIsASecret\",\n  \"tampering_cookie_prefix\": \"tampering_protection\",\n  \"tampering_violation_header_prefix\": \"azion-tampering-violation\"\n}\n```\n\nEstes são os mesmos campos que temos para Hash Generator, com a adição de mais um campo: `tampering_violation_header_prefix`, responsável por definir um prefixo para os cabeçalhos que a função anexará à solicitação sempre que uma violação de cookie for identificada.\n\nVocê deve prestar atenção aos possíveis valores adicionados ao campo `tampering_violation_header_prefix`.\n\nPor exemplo, os cabeçalhos `Cookie-Violation-Any`, `Cookie-Violation-Counter` e `Cookie-Violation-List` serão criados se o valor desse argumento for `Cookie-Violation`.\n\nSe este argumento não tiver dados válidos, os padrões são `Azion-Tampering-Violation-Any`, `Azion-Tampering-Violation-Counter` e `Azion-Tampering-Violation-List`.\n\n---\n\n## Configurando uma regra no Rules Engine\n\nAinda na página **Edge Application**, na aba **Rules Engine**, você deverá configurar as regras  com os *criteria* (critérios) e *behavior* (comportamento) que deseja aplicar para executar sua função.\n\nPrimeiro, você deverá configurar a **response phase** no **Rules Engine**.\nPara fazer isso, siga estes passos:\n\n1. Selecione a aba **Rules Engine**.\n2. Clique no botão **New Rule** e selecione **Response Phase**.\n3. Dê um nome fácil de lembrar à sua nova regra.\n4. Passe os *criteria* que você precisa para executar sua solução.\n5. No campo de *behavior*, selecione **Run Function** no menu suspenso e, em seguida, selecione a função **Signed Cookies - Hash Generator** de acordo com o nome que você deu na etapa de instanciação.\n6. Clique no botão **Save**\n\nAgora, você deverá configurar a **request phase** no **Rules Engine**.\nPara fazer isso, siga estes passos:\n\n1. Selecione a aba **Rules Engine**.\n2. Clique no botão **New Rule** e selecione  **Request Phase**.\n3. Dê um nome fácil de lembrar à sua nova regra.\n4. Passe os *criteria* que você precisa para executar sua solução.\n5. No campo de *behavior*, selecione **Run Function** no menu suspenso e, em seguida, selecione a função **Signed Cookies - Hash Validator** de acordo com o nome que você deu na etapa de instanciação.\n   - Você precisará de um *segundo behavior* para a função **Signed Cookies - Hash Validator**: **Forward Cookies**.\n6. Para adicioná-lo, clique no botão `+` e selecione a opção **Forward Cookies** no menu suspenso.\n7. Clique no botão **Save**.\n\nPronto. Você instanciou com sucesso suas duas soluções e agora está protegido contra invasores.\n\n\n",

O CGI é o método responsável por processar requisições e estabelecer uma linha de comunicação entre cliente e servidor através de variáveis de ambiente.\n\nO cabeçalho `Proxy` em requisições HTTP é considerado vulnerável a requisições nocivas em ambientes CGI. Quando um valor para o cabeçalho `Proxy` é enviado em uma requisição HTTP, esse valor substitui a variável de ambiente `HTTP_PROXY` utilizada para configurar proxies de saída. Isso significa que qualquer requisição interna gerada pelo cliente pode ser redirecionada para um servidor proxy externo e os dados contidos dentro dela podem ser capturados.\n\n> Para mais informações sobre esta vulnerabilidade, visite o [site oficial de HTTPoxy](https://httpoxy.org/) ou a [base de dados em vulnerabilidades do CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC)](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/797896).\n\n---\n\n## Criando uma regra para bloquear o cabeçalho HTTP Proxy\n\nPara mitigar suas aplicações contra a HTTPoxy, siga os passos para bloquear o cabeçalho HTTP `Proxy` durante a *Request Phase*.\n\n1.

Clique no botão *Add certificate* e selecione a opção *Trusted CA Certificate* no menu *dropdown*.\n4. Na página de cadastro de novos certificados, defina um nome de identificação para este certificado no campo *\"Digital Certificate Name\"*.\n5. Insira em *Certificate* o conteúdo que representa seu **Trusted CA**.\n    > Lembrando que o arquivo do certificado precisa ser do tipo `.pem` Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM). Exemplo: `certificado.pem`.\n6. Clique no botão *Save* para prosseguir.\n\nVocê será redirecionado para a página **Digital Certificates**, onde estarão listados todos os seus certificados, incluindo este recém-adicionado.\n\n## Escolha os domínios\n\nApós adicionar um **Trusted CA** à sua biblioteca de certificados, é necessário configurar quais domínios devem operar com mTLS.\n\n1. Acesse a página **Domains**, encontrada no **Products Menu (☰)**.\n2. Clique no domínio referente a aplicação que gostaria de configurar **mTLS**.\n3. Ative o switch *Enable Mutual Authentication (mTLS)*.\n4. Escolha qual o modo de verificação deseja utilizar. Pode ser `Enforce` ou `Permissive`.\n5. Selecione o **Trusted CA Certificate**, adicionado no passo anterior, no menu *dropdown*.\n6. Clique no botão **Save** para prosseguir.\n\nAo selecionar a verificação `Enforce` (padrão), o mTLS estará ativado em sua **Edge Application** e todo tráfego que receber cumprirá a autenticação de cliente e de servidor. \n\nNo entanto, se a necessidade é testar ou acessar sua aplicação a partir de condições específicas, escolha a verificação `Permissive`. O ajuste do modo `Permissive` é feito através do **Rules Engine** do **Edge Firewall** e os passos estão descritos na seção abaixo.\n\n> É importante lembrar que a má configuração do modo de verificação `Permissive` pode resultar em incidentes de segurança.\n\n## Adicionando regras específicas para uso do Permissive mTLS\n\nPara configurar a operação do modo `Permissive`: \n\n1. Acesse o **Products Menu (☰)**.\n2. Na categoria SECURE, clique em **Edge Firewall**.\n3. Se não houver um Firewall configurado, clique em *Add Rule Set* e defina um nome de identificação para essas regras.\n4. Em *Domain Settings*, selecione o domínio da sua aplicação e cliquei no botão `>`, para mandar o domínio escolhido para *Chosen Domains*.\n5. Clique em *Save*.\n6. Com o *Rule Set* criado, clique na aba **Rules Engine** do **Edge Firewall**.\n7. Clique no botão **New Rule**.\n8. Escolha um nome identificador para esta regra em *Rule Name*.\n9. Defina os *Criterias* e *Behaviors* específicos para sua necessidade.\n    > Para este exemplo, seguiremos com a lógica: `Criteria: If: Hostname is equal to `yourDomain.com` + And Client Certificate Validation is not equal to true. Behaviors: Then Deny (403 Forbidden)`.\n10. Certifique-se de que o switch Active está ativado.\n11. Clique no botão *Save*.\n\nSem suporte a mTLS ativado na sua conta da Azion, a opção *Criteria*, *Client Certificate Validation*, não irá aparecer.\n\n> Nessa lógica de exemplo, o **Rule Set** criado irá bloquear (Error 403 Forbidden) qualquer tráfego de rede de entrada com um **hostname** igual a `yourDomain.com`, mas que a validação do certificado do cliente não for verdadeira.\n\n## Especificando variáveis do mTLS no Header da aplicação\n\nCaso sua aplicação faça parte do modelo Open Banking, será necessário especificar as variáveis `${ssl_client_escaped_cert}` e `${ssl_client_s_dn_parsed}` no *header* da sua aplicação. Você também pode inserir outras variáveis do mTLS. [Confira a lista de variáveis disponíveis e suas descrições](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/rules-engine/).\n\nPara adicionar uma variável no header da sua aplicação, siga os passos:\n\n1. Dentro do **RTM**, abra o **Products Menu (☰)**\n2. Clique em **Edge Application**.\n3. Encontre e clique na aplicação com mTLS ativado.\n4. Dentro das configurações da sua **Edge Application**, clique na aba *Rules Engine*.\n5. Clique no botão *New Rule* e selecione *Request Phase*.\n6. Defina um nome identificador para esta *Rule*.\n7. No campo * Critéria* troque o operador `is equal` para `exists`.\n8. No campo *Behaviors* selecione a opção *Add Request Header* e adicione a variável que deseja inserir no header da sua aplicação.\n    > **Dica:** o uso do prefixo `X-` no `header-name` de variáveis HTTP customizadas é desencorajado pela entidade responsável pelo desenvolvimento do HTTP, Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), desde 2012 ([RFC 6648](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc6648/)). A IETF recomenda o uso de um `header-name` comum, que indique o uso real da variável, mas que não conflite com as variáveis padrões.\n\n9. Certifique-se que o switch **Active** está ativado.\n\n10. Para adicionar mais uma variável, clique no `+` e volte para o passo 7.\n11. Clique no botão **Save**.\n\nUma das formas de testar a inserção dessas variáveis é com a ferramenta [curl](https://curl.se/). A partir de um diretório contendo seu **Trusted CA** e sua respectiva chave em um arquivos `.pem`. Exemplo: `cert.pem` e `key.pem`, abra o terminal e rode `curl -skv https://<yourDomain.com>/ -H \"pragma:azion-debug-cache\" -o /dev/stdout --cert cert.pem --key key.pem`. Você deve encontrar `header-name:value` das variáveis adicionadas na resposta.\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n**Dig** ou **comando dig** é uma ferramenta de linha de comando para consulta de informações sobre domínios em servidores Domain Name System (DNS). Originalmente chamado de Domain Information Groper, o comando faz parte do BIND, um grupo de ferramentas de rede mantido pelo Internet Systems Consortium (ISC).\n\nO comando `dig` é comumente utilizado para solução de problemas de rede, domínios e outras operações envolvendo DNS. É, também, uma alternativa multiplataforma e mais poderosa ao descontinuado `nslookup`.\n\nNeste guia, iremos consultar registros de um domínio específico e de diversos domínios na mesma requisição; selecionar qual servidor DNS utilizar para a consulta; descobrir a latência (em milissegundos); quais são os IPs associados aos domínios consultados; além de rastrear todo o processo de resolução dos nameservers, da raiz até o último nameserver autoritário (que mantém os registros do domínio).\n\n\n---\n\n## Como instalar o comando dig\n\nPor padrão, o comando dig vem instalado na maioria das versões do *macOS* e em algumas distribuições *Linux*, mas não vem instalado no *Windows* e na maioria das distribuições Linux.\n\n### Instalando dig no Windows\n\n1. Faça o download da versão *Current-Stable, ESV* do BIND pela [página de downloads do ISC](https://www.isc.org/download/).\n2. Extraia todo o conteúdo do arquivo compactado `BIND9.18.14.tar.xz` em uma pasta dedicada.\n3. Execute o arquivo `BINDInstall.exe` como administrador.\n4. Utilize a opção *Tools Only* para instalar somente as ferramentas `dig`, `host`, `nslookup` e `nsupdate`.\n\n> Ainda é possível utilizar o BIND no Windows. No entanto, o suporte da ferramenta ao sistema foi removido em uma [atualização de 2021](https://www.isc.org/blogs/bind-update-summer2021/).\n\n### Instalando dig em distribuições Linux\n\nPara instalar o comando em distribuições baseadas em Debian, como Ubuntu, PopOS e Kali Linux:\n\n1. Abra o terminal.\n2. Rode `sudo apt-get install dnsutils`.\n    > Para instalar em outras distribuições Linux, consulte a documentação do desenvolvedor.\n3. Rode `dig -v` para checar a versão instalada.\n\n---\n\n## Como utilizar o comando dig\n\nPara realizar uma consulta com o comando `dig`:\n\n1. Abra o terminal (*Command Line Prompt*, *Power Shell* ou *Git Bash* para sistemas Windows).\n2. Rode `dig azion.com` (troque `azion.com` pelo domínio que quiser consultar).\n\nTambém é possível realizar uma consulta de diversos domínios na mesma requisição. Para isso:\n\n1. Crie um arquivo de texto para armazenar os domínios de interesse. Exemplo: `domains.txt`.\n2. Dentro do arquivo, separe os domínios por linha. Exemplo:\n\n    ```\n    azion.com\n    google.com\n    github.com\n    ```\n\n3. Abra o terminal.\n4. Rode `dig domains.txt`.\n\nA resposta para esses comandos é composta por quatro seções: **Cabeçalho**, **OPT PSEUDOSECTION**, **ANSWER SECTION** e **rodapé**. \n\nHá informações relevantes em todas as seções da resposta. No entanto, para este guia, vamos dar atenção as duas últimas seções: **ANSWER SECTION** e o **rodapé**.\n\nA seção **ANSWER SECTION** é onde devem aparecer os registros DNS encontrados. Já no **rodapé**, é possível encontrar informações como o tempo da latência, em milissegundos, além de qual servidor DNS foi utilizado para resolver a requisição.\n\nPor padrão, o comando `dig` utiliza uma lista de servidores DNS armazenada localmente na sua máquina. \n\nSe deseja utilizar uma lista de DNS específica, como as do Google (`8.8.8.8`, `8.8.4.4`, `2001:4860:4860::8888` e `2001:4860:4860::8844`), por exemplo, utilize o marcador `@` + IP da lista. Veja um exemplo do comando:\n\n`dig @8.8.8.8 azion.com` ou `dig @8.8.8.8 domains.txt`\n\nJá para rastrear todo o trajeto de servidores DNS, acrescente a opção `+trace` ao comando. Veja um exemplo:\n\n`dig azion.com +trace`\n\nA opção `+trace` é uma instrução para retornar o caminho completo que o servidor DNS percorreu para resolver a consulta.\n\nEssa resposta é bem diferente da requisição simples e apresenta todos os servidores DNS envolvidos na resolução de um domínio, passando pelos servidores do *Top-Level Domain (TLD)* até chegar no último servidor autoritário\n\nChecar a latência de uma aplicação web com o comando dig é uma das formas de validação do serviço de Edge Computing da Azion. É possível, por exemplo, comparar a latência da sua aplicação, servida por um serviço de Cloud Computing e pela Edge da Azion.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/X2Ei0zrZxxk\" title=\"Looking up DNS servers with Dig command YouTube video\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n\n",

    "body": "\nO **Marketplace da Azion** é um catálogo digital que torna fácil encontrar, testar e implantar softwares que rodem no edge. Com uma ampla gama de soluções, você pode usá-lo para melhorar, compor ou personalizar suas aplicações. Além disso, ele proporciona um meio para que os Fornecedores Independentes de Software (ISVs), desenvolvedores de software e comunidades de código aberto distribuam software para uma audiência de milhares de compradores.\n\nSendo um catálogo digital, o Marketplace da Azion permite que os desenvolvedores implementem uma solução (solution) que atenda seus requisitos, fornecendo recursos que podem ser utilizados tanto dentro como fora da [Azion Edge Network](https://www.azion.com/pt-br/produtos/edge-network/). \n\nNo Marketplace da Azion, você encontrará soluções para rodar suas edge functions de diversas maneiras, tais como [Edge Firewall](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-firewall/) ou [Edge Application](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/) nas áreas de segurança, desempenho, banco de dados e soluções de IA.\n\n---\n\n## Acessar o Marketplace\n\nPara acessar o **Marketplace** da Azion, proceda conforme a seguir: \n- Abra o [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/). \n- Verifique se você tem uma conta registrada na Azion, caso você ainda não tenha, [crie uma aqui](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/gestao-de-contas/criar-conta/).\n\nPara acessar o Marketplace, proceda conforme a seguir:\n\n1. [Acesse o RTM](https://manager.azion.com/).\n2. No canto superior esquerdo da página, selecione **Products menu**, identificado por três linhas horizontais.\n3. Selecione **Marketplace**.\n\nNavegue para explorar todas as soluções disponíveis ou filtre-as de acordo com a categoria a qual a solução pertence; tais como *security*, *performance* etc.\n\n---\n\n## Obtendo uma solução\n\nPara instalar qualquer solução fornecida pelo Marketplace da Azion, siga estes passos:\n\n1. No canto superior esquerdo da página, selecione **Products menu*** > **Marketplace**.\n2. Na página inicial do Marketplace, você tem duas maneiras de procurar uma solução: \n    1. Na caixa de busca, você pode digitar o nome completo da solução, ou apenas uma palavra-chave ou parte dela. Isto retornará qualquer solução que combine com o texto.\n    2. Você também pode navegar através dos cards para encontrar a solução desejada.\n3. Selecione o card da solução desejada e você será redirecionado para a página dela.\n4. Na seção **Subscribe for**, no canto inferior direito da página, clique no botão **Get It Now**.\n\n> Uma mensagem de sucesso irá aparecer na sua tela indicando que a sua solução está instalada e pronta para ser usada.\n\n---\n\n## Usando a solução\n\nApós a instalação de uma solução no diretório **Marketplace**, ela estará disponível para uso em sua conta.\n\nCada solução tem sua finalidade com características específicas. Você encontrará mais informações sobre ela nas guias de **Overview**, **Usage Information** e **Support**.\n\n> **Nota**: uma solução pode ter dependências e exigir mais ações. Visite a [página de guias da Azion](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/#marketplace) para consultar o passo a passo de instalação para cada solução.\n\nAs soluções atuais requerem a ativação do módulo **Edge Functions**. Você deve verificar se este está habilitado para suas aplicações em **Account menu** > **Billing & Subscriptions**.\n\nAtualmente, você pode usar uma solução do Marketplace dentro de uma **Edge Application** ou de um **Edge Firewall**. Cada uma dessas opções tem sua própria configuração, conforme será explicado a seguir.\n\n---\n\n## Instanciando uma edge application\n\n### Se você já tem uma edge application \n\nSe você já tem uma edge application, você pode instanciar sua solução diretamente para essa edge application, seguindo os passos abaixo:\n\n1. No canto superior esquerdo, selecione **Products menu**, identificado pelas três linhas horizontais.\n2. Na seção **BUILD**, selecione **Edge Application** para carregar a lista de edge applications já criadas.\n3. Selecione a edge application na qual deseja instanciar sua solução recém-instalada.\n4. Habilite o switch **Functions** para sua edge application clicando nele.\n5. Clique no botão **Save**.\n\n---\n\n### Se você ainda não tem uma edge application \n\nCaso você não tenha nenhuma edge application, você pode criar uma tanto manualmente como pela jornada do usuário.\n\n#### Manualmente\n\n1. No **Products menu**, selecione **Edge Application** na seção **BUILD**.\n2. Clique no botão **Add Application**.\n3. Dê um nome fácil de lembrar para sua edge application.\n4. Selecione **Single Origin** no campo **Origin Type**.\n5. Dê um endereço no campo **Address**.\n6. Defina `${host}` no campo **Header Host Header**.\n7. Clique no botão **Save**.\n\nPara utilizar sua nova solução, você terá que instanciá-la em sua edge application.\n\nPara fazer isso, siga os passos:\n\n1. Selecione na lista de edge applications aquela recém-criada.\n2. Na aba **Main Settings**, ative o switch **Functions** para ativar funções em sua edge application.\n3. Clique no botão **Save**.\n\nAinda na página da sua edge application, siga os passos para instanciar uma solução:\n\n1. Na lista superior, selecione a aba **Functions**.\n2. Clique no botão **Add Function**.\n3. Na caixa de texto do nome da sua edge function, dê um nome fácil de lembrar.\n4. No menu suspenso de funções, selecione a função que você instalou através do **Marketplace**.\n\nIsto irá carregar a função, mostrando um formulário com o código-fonte da função e duas abas: **Code** e **Args**. Nesta área, cada solução tem uma configuração diferente. Para saber mais sobre como instalar sua solução, vá para a seção [de guias na documentação da Azion](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/#marketplace) e selecione a solução que deseja utilizar.\n\n> **Nota**: algumas soluções exigirão mais recursos para serem executadas. Para tais casos, você pode verificar a página de [guias da Azion](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/#marketplace).\n\n#### Através da jornada do usuário\n\n1. Vá para a página inicial do **RTM**.\n2. Selecione a opção **Build an Edge Application**.\n3. Na próxima tela, forneça um nome fácil de lembrar para sua edge application.\n4. Selecione a opção **Run a function**.\n5. Na opção **Configure function**, selecione a solução que você instalou através do Marketplace no menu suspenso.\n6. Um formulário com o código-fonte da solução aparecerá.\n- A aba chamada **Code** é apenas para estudo, você não pode modificá-la. No mesmo formulário, você tem uma aba chamada **Args**. Nessa aba, você passará seus parâmetros de configuração, de acordo com a solução que você instalou.\n7. Clique no botão **Next**.\n\nPronto. Na próxima tela, chamada **Launch**, você terá as informações da sua edge application, como o endereço para acessá-la e um resumo do processo de build, chamado de **Build Summary**.\n\n> Você pode ler sobre as configurações das soluções na seção de [guias da Azion](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/#marketplace).\n\n---\n\n## Instanciando uma solução do tipo edge firewall\n\nO processo para instanciar uma solução do tipo edge firewall é semelhante ao processo de uma edge application. No entanto, ele tem algumas diferenças nos locais de configuração.\n\nPara instanciar uma solução do tipo edge firewall, siga estes passos:\n\n1. Selecione **Products menu** > **Edge Firewall** na seção **SECURE**.\n2. Você pode selecionar qualquer uma de suas aplicações de **Edge Firewall** ou criar uma nova.\n    1. Para criar uma nova, você tem que clicar no botão **Add Rule Set**.\n    2. Dê um nome fácil de lembrar para sua solução.\n    3. Selecione os domínios onde o firewall estará ativo.\n    4. Habilite as edge functions para seu edge firewall clicando no switch **Functions**.\n    5. Clique no botão **Save**.\n3. Vá até a aba **Function** e clique em **Add Function** para adicionar a solução que você instalou. Você será redirecionado para a página do edge firewall.\n5. Dê um nome fácil de lembrar para sua solução.\n6. Selecione a função que você adicionou através de **Marketplace** na lista suspensa **Edge Functions**. \n    - Assim que você escolher a sua solução, o código-fonte será carregado, acima dele você conta com duas abas, **Code** e **Args**. Cada solução tem uma configuração e, para saber como configurar a sua solução, vá até a [página de documentação da Azion](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/#marketplace).\n7. Vá para a aba **Rules Engine** e crie a regra para definir os *criteria* (critérios) para quando executar sua função e os *behavior* (comportamentos) e indique **Run Function** como ação no menu suspenso. Em seguida, indique a função que você instalou através do Marketplace de acordo com o nome que você escolheu previamente.\n\nPronto. Agora você pode utilizar a sua solução no edge firewall.\n\n---\n\n## Como atualizar uma versão da sua solução do Marketplace da Azion\n\nAs soluções apresentadas dentro do **Marketplace** da Azion não são estáticas; tanto a Azion quanto os nossos parceiros podem atualizá-las de acordo com o surgimento de novas funcionalidades. Recomendamos sempre utilizar a última versão, conforme disponibilizada pelo parceiro ou pela Azion.\n\nPara certificar-se de que você estará rodando a última versão da solução adquirida no Marketplace, basta seguir esses passos:\n\n1. No canto superior esquerdo da página do **RTM**, selecione **Products menu** > **Marketplace**.\n2. Selecione a solução que você quer atualizar.\n3. Clique no botão **Get New Version** para atualizar a solução.\n\nUma mensagem irá informar que sua solução foi atualizada com sucesso. Posteriormente, você poderá visualizar todas as suas soluções na sua lista de **Edge Functions**.\n\n**Importante**: quando você atualiza uma solução dentro do Marketplace, a versão da solução que você está executando em sua edge application não é sobrescrita. Isto ocorre para lhe dar controle sobre a versão que você deseja usar com sua aplicação. Por exemplo, você pode testar uma nova versão de uma solução com uma edge application diferente, e, assim, quando você tiver concluído o processo de validação da sua edge application, você pode modificar a versão que será executada. Para alterar a versão, vá até o menu suspenso das funções de sua edge application.\n\n---\n\n## Guias de instalação\n\nCada uma das soluções pode precisar de configurações e dependências diferentes para ser instalada e funcionar corretamente. Para consultar como configurar uma solução específica e conseguir instalá-la com sucesso, visite a [página de guias da Azion](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/#marketplace) e selecione o guia relacionado com a solução que você quer utilizar.\n\n---\n\n## Permissões\n\nPara usar o Marketplace adequadamente, algumas soluções precisarão de algumas permissões para executar ações em sua conta. Isso acontece porque algumas soluções têm instalações semiautomáticas. Para entender mais sobre as permissões, você pode visitar a página de documentação [Permissões do Marketplace](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/permissoes-mktp/). \n\n---\n\n## Modelos de negócio\n\nO Marketplace da Azion opera com os seguintes modelos de negócios:\n\n1. **Bring your own License (BYOL)**: traga a licença ou credenciais ISV atuais e as insira no componente de código do **Edge Function**.\n2. **Free model**: a solução pode ser lançada em qualquer lugar, sujeita aos termos de uso.\n\n> Para outros tipos de licença, contate o [time de vendas da Azion](https://www.azion.com/pt-br/contate-vendas/).\n\n\n",

As opções de preços flexíveis incluem *Bring Your Own License (BYOL)*  - traga sua própria licença - por *resquest*, tempo de computação, *data transfer*, sem custo e muito mais. A Azion cuida de faturamento e pagamentos, e os encargos aparecem na fatura Azion dos clientes, o que reduz drasticamente o tempo de aquisição.\n\nVocê pode usar o Azion Marketplace como comprador (assinante), vendedor (fornecedor), ou ambos. Qualquer pessoa com uma conta Azion pode usar o Azion Marketplace como comprador, e pode se registrar para se tornar um vendedor. Um vendedor pode ser um *Independent Software Vendor (ISV)*, revendedor de valor agregado ou indivíduo que tenha algo a oferecer que funcione com produtos e serviços da Azion.\n\nCada produto de software no Azion Marketplace passou por um processo de curadoria. Na página *Produto*, pode haver uma ou mais ofertas para o produto. Quando o vendedor apresenta um produto no Azion Marketplace, ele define o preço do mesmo e os termos e condições de uso. Quando um consumidor subscreve uma oferta de produto, ele concorda com o preço e os termos e condições estabelecidos para a oferta.\n\nO produto pode ser de uso gratuito ou ter uma cobrança associada. A cobrança passa a fazer parte da conta do cliente e, após o pagamento, o Azion Marketplace paga o vendedor. Os produtos podem assumir várias formas. Por exemplo, um produto pode ser oferecido como um *Azion Cells Package (ACP)* que é instanciado usando sua conta Azion. O produto também pode ser uma Edge Function da Azion ou um modelo com uma predefinição de regras para qualquer produto da Azion.\n\nOs produtos de software podem ser adquiridos pelo preço listado usando o acordo de licença de usuário final padrão da ISV (EULA) ou oferecidos com os preços do cliente e o EULA. Os produtos também podem ser adquiridos sob um *Saving Plan* - Plano de economia -  com tempo ou limites de uso especificados. \n\nUma vez que as assinaturas do produto estão em vigor, o cliente pode copiar o produto em suas *Azion Edge Libraries* para gerenciar como o produto é acessado e usado na organização do cliente.\n\n## Inscreva-se no Azion Marketplace\n\nO Azion Marketplace foi desenvolvido para *Independent Software Vendor (ISV)*, revendedores de valor agregado ou indivíduos que têm algo a oferecer que funciona com produtos e serviços Azion.\n\nPara ser elegível para listar seu produto com uma cobrança associada, você deve poder receber pagamentos da Azion, portanto, atender aos seguintes requisitos:\n\n* Sua organização deve ser constituída nos EUA.\n- Sua organização deve ter uma conta bancária nos Estados Unidos.\n\n## Prepare seu produto\n\nVocê prepara seu produto para publicação no Azion Marketplace configurando seu pacote, estabelecendo um esquema de preços (se houver), determinando em quais categorias seu produto deve aparecer.\n\nVocê pode construir e executar seu software inteiramente na plataforma *Edge Computing da Azion* usando um modelo baseado em *Azion Cells Package* (ACP), ou decidir executá-lo parcialmente na Azion usando um modelo baseado em *Software as a Service (SaaS)*, onde os usuários acessam seu próprio painel de controle para fazer alterações no serviço. Seus produtos são vendidos e cobrados através do Azion Marketplace, exceto se o cliente escolher um modelo de assinatura *BYOL*.\n\nPara oferecer seu produto no Azion Marketplace e cobrar dos clientes através da Azion, sua equipe de desenvolvimento deve integrá-lo à plataforma Azion e ao *Azion Marketplace Metering Service*, para que os usuários possam implantar seu produto com o mínimo de esforço.\n\nVocê pode criar produtos com uma lista de preços padrão e contrato de licença de usuário final (EULA), e pode criar ofertas particulares para clientes individuais com preços especiais e EULAs - geralmente necessários para grandes empresas ou RFPs.\n\n### Preços do produto\n\nSeu produto pode ser oferecido em três modelos diferentes: um modelo baseado em Assinatura, um modelo *Bring Your Own License (BYOL)* - traga sua própria licença - e um modelo de Software Livre.\n\nA seguir, informações gerais sobre preços de produtos no Azion Marketplace. Todos os preços são baseados em dólares americanos (USD).\n\n* No Azion Marketplace, não há taxa de serviço para trazer sua própria licença (BYOL) ou produtos no modelo de Software gratuito.\n* Para cumprir a promessa de seleção de nossos clientes, exigimos que todos os produtos BYOL também tenham uma opção paga. Isto é para que os clientes que não possuem licenças existentes tenham a opção de comprar e usar os produtos.\n  * Para produtos BYOL, percebemos que a compra online de software é diferente da forma como algumas empresas fazem negócios. Diante disso, durante os primeiros 90 dias após o lançamento, relaxaremos a exigência de que este software seja acompanhado por uma versão disponível para compra no Azion Marketplace. Durante este tempo, as equipes de gerenciamento de conta do Azion Marketplace trabalharão com você para enfrentar os desafios e determinar se e como o software pode ser disponibilizado para compra no Azion Marketplace.\n* Para produtos pagos, o vendedor define as taxas de uso do software e o Azion Marketplace cobra taxas de software do cliente.\n* Todos os produtos do vendedor incorrerão em encargos associados à Azion, dependendo dos serviços utilizados. Estas tarifas e taxas são definidas e controladas pela Azion. São exibidas separadamente nas páginas detalhadas do Azion Marketplace para ajudar os clientes a entender o custo potencial de utilização dos produtos.\n\n#### A. Modelo de Software gratuito\n\nAs soluções de modelo de software gratuito permitem que você execute software na plataforma Azion Edge enquanto usa licenças gratuitamente. A Azion cobrará dos clientes os custos dos serviços da Azion, incluindo o uso do modelo de Software gratuito.\n\n#### B.  Bring Your Our Licence - BYOL\n\nDisponível para clientes com licenças atuais adquiridas por meio de outros canais.\n\nAs soluções *BYOL*  permitem que você execute software na plataforma Azion Edge enquanto usa licenças adquiridas diretamente do vendedor. A Azion cobra dos clientes apenas os custos dos serviços da Azion, dando-lhes flexibilidade para comprar e gerenciar suas próprias licenças.\n\n#### C. Assinatura de Software\n\nCom o modelo de Assinatura de Software você usará o Azion Marketplace para cobrar pelo uso de seu produto. Você pode escolher entre duas opções diferentes, *Pay As You Go (PAYG)* ou *Saving Plans* - planos de economia.\n\n**Pay As You Go**\n\nEm um modelo *Pay As You Go*, o Azion Marketplace fatura seus clientes com base nos registros de medição de uso de seu software e o preço por esse uso, estabelecido por você. É um modelo sem compromisso e a utilização é calculada e faturada mensalmente.\n\nPara produtos baseados em ACP, o Azion Marketplace cobrará do seu cliente com base nos registros de medição disponíveis na *Plataforma de Edge da Azion*. Os registros de medição disponíveis são:\n\n* Número de instâncias implantadas\n- Número de usuários registrados\n- Requests\n- Tempo de computação\n- Data Transfer\n\nPara produtos  SaaS, o Azion Marketplace fatura seus clientes com base na medição informada por seu SaaS aplicando a lista de preços estabelecida por você.\n\nO *Azion Marketplace Metering Service* requer que seu software relate o uso a cada hora, registrando o uso do cliente por hora. Se houver uma falha na transmissão ou recebimento dos registros do serviço de medição, a Azion não poderá cobrar por tal uso. Você é responsável por garantir o recebimento bem-sucedido dos registros de medição.\n\nVocê pode usar qualquer registro de medição que se adapte ao seu modelo de negócios SaaS, desde que tenha estabelecido a lista de preços para ele e seu SaaS relate o uso corretamente.\n\nOs clientes podem usar seu produto em um teste gratuito por um período fixo de tempo neste modelo de preço. No final de uma avaliação gratuita, os clientes serão inscritos automaticamente no modelo PAYG, a menos que ele ou ela cancele ou desista anteriormente.\n\n**Saving Plans**\n\nNo modelo *Saving Plan*, o cliente inicia uma compra de seu software, construído como um ACP ou um produto baseado em SaaS, e entra em um contrato com você. De acordo com o contrato, o cliente tem direito a uma quantidade especificada de uso de seu produto SaaS.\n\nEm caso de uso excessivo por parte dos clientes, eles pagarão o preço de acordo com o seu consumo (PAYG).\n\nO Azion Marketplace pode cobrar seus clientes antecipadamente ou pelo cronograma de pagamento que você definir, com base no *Saving Plan* entre você e seu cliente. Após esse ponto, os clientes têm o direito de usar seu software.\n\nPor exemplo, um cliente pode comprar uma quantidade de *requests* para seu SaaS por um período de 1 mês ou por períodos de 1 ano, 2 anos ou 3 anos. Para uso adicional acima de seus *Saving Plans*, o Azion Marketplace cobra seus clientes com base no preço pré-pago (PAYG) estabelecido por você.\n\nO cliente pode iniciar a negociação do preço do produto com você em uma oferta privada. Você negociará os preços e o uso em particular com o cliente, e os termos negociados começam assim que o cliente aceitar a oferta.\n\n## Azion Marketplace Tiered Listing Fees\n\nAs taxas de listagem - *Listing Fees* - para o conteúdo do Marketplace serão calculadas em uma base escalonada - *Tiered Listing Fee* ou  *TLF*, conforme determinado pelo valor de uma assinatura de um produto. Os ajustes de TLF se aplicam a todos os tipos de produtos, independentemente do método de implantação. O valor de cada transação é calculado com base no valor em dólares do pagamento que está sendo feito pelo assinante do Conteúdo do seu Marketplace. Se o assinante estiver pagando por um produto medido pelo *Azion Marketplace Metering Service*, o valor da transação será o valor cobrado do cliente a cada mês. As reduções na  com base nos aumentos no valor da transação serão aplicadas mês a mês e não serão retroativas.\n\n### A. Produtos com base em SaaS\n\nPara produtos com base em SaaS adquiridos no Azion Marketplace, o cálculo da TLF da taxa de listagem é de acordo com valor e duração da assinatura. A Tabela 1 descreve as *Tiered Listing Fees* que o Azion Marketplace cobrará pelas transações de produtos baseados em SaaS, com base na duração e valor em dólar de cada transação:\n\n*Tabela 1 (Tiered Listing Fees para produtos SaaS):*\n\n| Tier | SaaS TLF Tiers                | Mensal e Anual | Ano 2 | Ano 3 |\n| :--- | ----------------------------- | -------------- | ----- | ----- |\n| 1    | Assinaturas abaixo de $20.000 | 13%            | 12%   | 11%   |\n| 2    | \\$20,001 - $99,999            | 11%            | 10%   | 9%    |\n| 3    | \\$100,000 \\- $999,999         | 10%            | 9%    | 8%    |\n| 4    | $1,000,000+                   | 9%             | 7%    | 6%    |\n\n>  Os *Tiers* de valor em dólares na tabela acima são calculados da seguinte forma: (i) para assinaturas medidas e *Saving Plans* mensais, o valor é o valor pago pelo cliente a cada mês e (ii) para assinaturas anuais ou plurianuais, o valor de toda a duração da assinatura é baseado no valor pago antecipadamente pelo cliente no momento em que o cliente entra na transação.\n\nAssinaturas medidas, *Saving Plans* mensais e *Saving Plans* de 1 ano receberão a taxa de listagem - *Listing Fee* -  \"mensal e anual\" até o início do segundo ano, ponto em que a taxa de listagem - *Listing Fee* - cairá para o valor de \"Ano 2\" (e assim para o Ano 3). As compras plurianuais que são cobradas antecipadamente ou em uma programação definida, receberão a *Tiered Listing Fee* aplicável ao último ano da assinatura para toda a Transação.\n\nPor exemplo, se um cliente é assinante de um produto SaaS e paga $ 19.000 por mês por uma assinatura medida, a taxa de listagem - *Listing Fee* - será de 13% para cada transação mensal (Tier 1, Taxa mensal). No mês 11, o cliente aumenta seu uso e é cobrado $ 21.000, portanto, a taxa de listagem - *Listing Fee* - cai para 11% (Tier 2, taxa mensal). No mês 13, o cliente manteve seu uso e é cobrado $ 21.000, mas como a assinatura entrou no ano 2, a taxa de listagem - *Listing Fee* - cai para 10% (Tier 2, taxa do ano 2). No mês 14, o cliente diminui seu uso para $ 19.000 e a taxa de listagem - *Listing Fee* - aumenta para 12% (Tier 1, taxa do ano 2).\n\n### B. Produto com base em ACP\n\nPara Software executado inteiramente na *Plataforma de Edge da Azion*, o cálculo TLF da taxa de listagem é baseado no valor da assinatura. A Tabela 2 descreve as *Tiered Listing Fees* que o Azion Marketplace cobrará, com base no valor em dólares de cada Transação:\n\n*Tabela 2 (Tiered Listing Fees para produtos de software):*\n\n| Tier | Software TLF Tiers   | Taxa de listagem por Tier |\n| ---- | -------------------- | ------------------------- |\n| 1    | Abaixo de $20.000    | 20%                       |\n| 2    | \\$20,001 - $99,999   | 17%                       |\n| 3    | \\$100,000 - $249,999 | 15%                       |\n| 4    | $250,000+            | 13%                       |\n\n>  Por exemplo, se um cliente for cobrado $ 19.000 pelo uso do software em 1 mês, a taxa de listagem - *Listing Fee* - será de 20% para essa transação (Tier 1). Se no segundo mês o cliente aumentar o uso de seu software e for cobrado $ 21.000, a taxa de listagem - *Listing Fee* - cairá para 17% para essa transação (Tier 2).\n\n",

Este link lhe levará para o [Real-Time Metrics](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/real-time-metrics).\n\nNo lado direito da página inicial do **RTM**, você encontra links úteis para a página de [documentação da Azion](/pt-br/documentacao), o [changelog](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/changelog), a biblioteca de [APIs da Azion](https://api.azion.com/) e como contatar nosso time de [Suporte](https://tickets.azion.com/pt-BR/support/login/new).\n\nLogo após a seção **Getting Started**, você encontra o formulário **Invite Your Team** para convidar o seu time a construir na Azion com você. Esse é um passo opcional, mas se você trabalha com um grupo de pessoas, pode usá-lo para convidar o seu time a construir na Azion com você. Descubra mais sobre essas permissões em [Teams Permissions](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/gestao-de-contas/teams-permissions/).\n\nAbaixo das opções de acesso rápido, você encontrará nossas quatro categorias de produtos: **Build**, **Secure**, **Deploy**, and **Observe**. Cada uma das categorias lhe guiará durante sua jornada na Azion e ajudará a configurar suas aplicações. Veja como explorar cada uma das categorias:\n\n* **Build**: crie e gerencie [Edge Applications](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application) e gerencie [Domains](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/domains).\n* **Secure**: proteja suas aplicações criando [Edge Firewalls](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-firewall), gerenciando [Intelligent DNS](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/intelligent-dns) e operando [regras de WAF](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-firewall/web-application-firewall).\n* **Deploy**: faça o deploy de [Edge Services](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-orchestrator/edge-services), [Edge Nodes](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-orchestrator/edge-node) e [Orchestrator](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-orchestrator).\n* **Observe**: visualize dados importantes usando [Real-Time Metrics](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/real-time-metrics), [Real-Time Events](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/real-time-events), [Data Streaming](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/data-streaming) e [Edge Pulse](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-pulse).\n\n![Categorias de produtos do Real-Time Manager](/assets/docs/images/uploads/rtm-categories.png)\n\nApós conhecer o **RTM**, você pode continuar usando a interface para criar **Edge Applications** na Azion. As próximas seções apresentarão instruções relacionadas aos passos que você precisa completar para configurar uma aplicação e um domínio, além de sugestões de passos e conteúdos adicionais para aprimorar sua aplicação através das quatro categorias da Azion — **Build**, **Secure**, **Deploy**, **Observe**.\n\n---\n## Passo 1. Crie uma nova Edge Application\n\nConstruir uma [Edge Application](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application), que permite que você construa suas aplicações web para rodarem na plataforma da Azion, é o primeiro passo para começar a usar a plataforma de Edge da Azion. Esta documentação guia você em cada passo da jornada para construir uma **Edge Application** do zero com a plataforma e com os produtos da Azion.\n\nApós fazer login no [RTM](https://manager.azion.com/), clique no bloco **Build an Edge Application**, localizado na seção **Getting Started** da página inicial para começar a construir suas aplicações.\n\n## BUILD\n\nO Passo 1 para construir sua **Edge Application** do zero é o **Build**. Você constrói uma aplicação ao completar as configurações apresentadas nas próximas seções. Além disso, você também encontra informações relacionadas aos campos obrigatórios para sua **Edge Application** começar a rodar.\n\n## Build with Edge Application\n\nAzion **Edge Application** permite que você construa suas aplicações para que elas sejam executadas na plataforma de Edge da Azion.\n\n### Nomeie sua Edge Application\n\nPara nomear sua **Edge Application**, você deve preencher a caixa de texto com um novo nome, que não afeta como os usuário finais acessam sua aplicação e pode ser modificado a qualquer momento.\n\n**Nota**: a plataforma retorna uma mensagem de erro se o nome já existir em sua biblioteca. Nesse caso, tente novamente com outro nome.\n\nEscolher um nome significativo para sua aplicação torna mais fácil gerenciá-la. Caso sua aplicação se relacione com:\n\n- **Domínio específico** (www.yourapp.com), use um nome relacionado com o nome do domínio (”www.yourapp.com” ou \"yourapp www\").\n- **Sistema de origem específico**, use um nome relacionado à origem (\"Cloud Bucket for Statics\"), visto que você pode associá-la a mais de um domínio.\n- **Uso específico de aplicação**, use um nome relacionado à sua função (”Checkout application”), visto que você pode associá-la a mais de um domínio.\n\n**Nota**: o nome da sua **Edge Application** serve para fins administrativos. O acesso por dispositivos e pelo usuário final ocorre através de um [nome de domínio associado](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/domains).\n\n> **Começando agora?**\n>\n> Para conhecer melhor a plataforma e criar sua primeira **Edge Application**, você pode:\n>\n> - Inserir um nome para teste.\n> - Seguir com \"Run a function\".\n> - Selecionar \"Azion - Hello World\" no campo \"**Choose Edge Function**\".\n> - Clicar em **Save** para continuar.\n>\n> Você também pode explorar as demais opções e descobrir mais sobre a plataforma.\n\n### Sobre Edge Application\n\nSua **Edge Application** é executada de maneira serverless como resposta a eventos ocorrendo nos **Edge Nodes** da [Edge Network global](https://www.azion.com/pt-br/produtos/edge-network). Resoluções de DNS são utilizadas para criar rotas dinâmicas de requisição com uma melhor conexão de ponta a ponta.\n\n[ Usuários e dispositivos EDGE  sua aplicação ou origem ]\n\nNo **Edge Node**, uma **Edge Application** associada ao domínio processa cada requisição executando uma [Rules Engine](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/rules-engine).\n\n- Cada regra usa critérios em declarações aninhadas `If-then` para acionar os comportamentos dos [módulos habilitados](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/#edge-application-modules), como, por exemplo, executar uma função ou definir uma origem.\n- Cada regra é executada até que todas sejam processadas ou até que uma regra com caráter finalizador seja encontrada.\n\nDescubra mais informações na nossa [página de documentação](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/ponto-de-partida).\n\n---\n\n## Select the setup option\n\nNa seção **Choose an option to start**, você seleciona uma opção para iniciar sua **Edge Application**. Para agilizar o processo, sua aplicação será construída e automaticamente associada com um domínio Azion de acordo com sua escolha de opção.\n\nPara construir uma **Edge Application** e automaticamente associá-la com um domínio Azion, selecione:\n\n- **Run a function**\n\nOpção pré-definida que lista todas as funções disponíveis em sua biblioteca de funções. A função *Hello World* é sua primeira opção, caso você esteja criando uma pela primeira vez.\n\n- **Fetch content from origin**\n\nCria uma **Edge Application** e configura uma [Origin](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/single-origin). A Azion busca seu conteúdo diretamente nessa origem e [honra os cache control headers](https://www.azion.com/pt-br/blog/o-que-e-http-caching-e-como-ele-funciona) retornados.\n\n**Nota**: Neste caso, sua **Edge Application** usa os módulos **Edge Caching** e **Application Acceleration** com políticas explícitas para armazenar arquivos e imagens estáticas em cache na rede de edge, entregando-os diretamente para seus usuários, a partir do **Edge Node** mais próximo, sem a necessidade de acessar a origem, melhorando a performance e a escalabilidade.\n\n- **Build an advanced Edge Application**\n\nPermite que você customize **Edge Functions** e servidores de origem em outro momento.\n\n> **Ainda com dúvidas?**\n>\n> Sua escolha define o modelo e as informações básicas de sua aplicação, mas elas podem ser modificadas a qualquer momento.\n>\n> Após completar este passo, será mais fácil explorar possíveis mudanças na sua aplicação e desenvolver seu uso.\n\nUma **Edge Application** é um conjunto de recursos e funcionalidades, como, por exemplo:\n\n- **Edge Functions** - código e seus argumentos.\n- **Edge Caching** - costuma buscar o conteúdo de uma origem.\n- **Network** - usada para criar regras de negócios avançadas com critérios e comportamentos no edge.\n\n---\n\n## Select a function\n\nNa seção **Configure function**, você seleciona a **Edge Function** que você utilizará na sua **Edge Application**.\n\n### Conhecendo Edge Functions\n\nAzion [**Edge Functions**](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/edge-functions) é um módulo da sua **Edge Application** que permite que você programe e execute funções serverless sem a necessidade de provisionar ou gerenciar servidores. O processamento completo ocorre direto no Edge Node da rede, mais próximo dos usuários.\n\n> **Como selecionar uma função Edge Function?**\n>\n> - Clique na lista suspensa **Choose Edge Function**.\n> - Selecione uma função da sua biblioteca; a seção com as abas **Code** e **Args** aparecerá.\n>\n> **Nota**: as funções listadas refletem sua própria biblioteca de funções. Se você não tem nenhuma função em sua biblioteca, você só pode selecionar a função \"Azion — Hello World\".\n>\n> - Leia o código da função na aba **Code**.\n>\n> **Nota**: esta aba é apenas para leitura.\n>\n> - Vá para a aba **Args** para editar.\n>\n> As funções escolhidas podem ser visualizadas na aba **Code** e parametrizadas na aba **Args**.\n\n---\n\n## Passo 2. Launch uma Edge Application\n\n## LAUNCH\n\nO Passo 2 para construir sua **Edge Application** do zero é o **Launch**. Nesse passo, você encontra as informações básicas da sua aplicação recém-criada e seu link. Você também encontra um conjunto de opções possíveis para finalizar sua aplicação de acordo com a configuração escolhida no Passo 1.\n\n## Run a Function – Próximos Passos\nPróximos passos para continuar suas configurações na Azion:\n\n1. Aguarde a publicação da sua aplicação e acesse-a através do link fornecido na página do Launch.\n\n2. Visualize seus Edge Application Logs e procure pelo seu acesso buscando a fonte de dados das Edge Applications. O [Real-Time Events](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/real-time-events) está localizado no **Products Menu** no canto superior esquerdo na seção **Observe**.\n\n3. [Conecte o seu DNS com sua Edge Application](#crie-dominio) ou continue explorando e crie suas próprias Edge Functions com o [guia](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/edge-functions-instances/#comoconfigurarsuasedgefunctions) e com os exemplos de [Edge Functions JavaScript](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/edge-functions/javascript-examples).\n\nConsidere migrar sua zona de DNS para o nosso [Intelligent DNS](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/intelligent-dns).\n\nPreparamos jornadas especiais para você acompanhar caso você esteja começando a explorar ou, também, caso seus sistemas já estejam sendo executados na Azion.\n\n---\n\n## Fetch Content from Origin – Próximos Passos \n\nPróximos passos para continuar suas configurações na Azion:\n\n1.

Considere migrar sua zona de DNS para o nosso [**Intelligent DNS**](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/intelligent-dns).\n\n---\n\nAgora que você já iniciou sua jornada para explorar o Edge, você pode continuar explorando a página de documentação e descobrir mais sobre nossos [produtos](/pt-br/documentacao/), nossas [APIs](https://api.azion.com/) e [guias de uso](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/) selecionados para você.\n\n> Quando você criar sua primeira edge application na Azion, você receberá um email com sugestões de *Next Steps*; os passos seguintes recomendados na sua jornada. Dessa forma, você poderá conhecer algumas das opções para configurar as aplicações e como você pode se beneficiar da plataforma de edge da Azion.\n\n---\n\n## Passo 3. Configure uma Edge Application\n\nApós [criar](#crie-edge-app) uma aplicação do zero, você pode customizá-la ou editá-la a qualquer momento.\n\nPara conferir suas configurações atuais e editá-las, entre no [**Real-Time Manager**](https://manager.azion.com/). Partindo da página inicial, siga os passos a seguir:\n\n1. Selecione o **Products Menu** no canto superior esquerdo.\n2. Na seção **Build**, selecione **Edge Application**.\n3. Na lista de **Edge Applications**, escolha a que você quer ver ou editar.\n\n**Nota**: se você ainda não tem uma **Edge Application**, volte para a página inicial do **RTM** e siga os passos da [criação de uma Edge Application](#crie-edge-app) ou clique no botão **Add application** na página de **Edge Application**.\n\nApós selecionar a **Edge Application** na qual você trabalhará, você verá uma página com as seguintes abas:\n\n* Main Settings\n* Origins\n* Device Groups\n* Error Response\n* Cache Settings\n* Functions (Edge Functions Instances)\n* Rules Engine\n\n\nVeja como configurar as abas **Main Settings**, **Origins** e **Cache Settings**:\n\n### Main Settings\n\nNesta seção, você definirá os principais campos relacionados à entrega das suas aplicações: **HTTP** ou **HTTP & HTTPS**. Além disso, os campos de **versão mínima do TLS** e **portas** também devem ser configurados.\n\n| Campo | Descrição |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Delivery Protocol](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/#protocolos) | Defina seu protocolo de entrega compatível com a sua aplicação web. <br /><br />HTTP: se a sua aplicação suporta apenas o protocolo HTTP. <br /><br />HTTP & HTTPS: se a sua aplicação suporta tanto os protocolos HTTP quanto HTTPS.<br /><br />Se você escolher HTTP & HTTPS como protocolo de entrega, você precisará definir a Minimum TLS version e [Digital Certificate](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/digital-certificates/). |\n| [Ports](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/#portas) | Defina quais portas serão utilizadas pela sua aplicação.<br /><br />Servidores web podem possuir padrões diferentes para portas HTTP ou HTTPS. Escolha dentre uma ou mais portas compatíveis com sua aplicação web. |\n| [Minimum TLS version](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/#minimum-tls-version) | A Transport Layer Security (TLS) garante comunicações criptografadas entre um cliente e um servidor da web por meio de padrões HTTPS. Os padrões do PCI recomendam o uso de TLS 1.2 ou superior. Lembre-se: se você usar novas versões, alguns dispositivos de clientes mais antigos ou navegadores não conseguirão se conectar. |\n\n---\n\n### Origins\n\n**Origins** é onde você define seus dados de origem, uma informação essencial para a sua **Edge Application**. Veja o que é necessário preencher em cada campo a seguir:\n\n| Campo | Descrição |\n| --- | --- |\n| Origin Type | Os campos a seguir referem-se ao tipo de [Single Origin](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/single-origin). Como você está criando uma nova aplicação, a Single Origin é a única opção. <br />Após criar e salvar a nova aplicação, você pode ativar o [Load Balancer](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/load-balancer). |\n| Address | Este campo define o endereço no qual você executa sua aplicação ou origem. Defina o endereço de origem da sua aplicação no formato FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name). Por exemplo, origin.azion.com ou um endereço IP.<br/><br />Por padrão, a Azion se conectará à sua origem através da porta 80, para HTTP, ou 443, para HTTPS. Suponha que você queira configurar uma porta diferente para se conectar à sua origem. Nesse caso, você pode usar a notação host:port neste campo, por exemplo, origin.azion.com:8080. Veja o campo abaixo para entender as opções de conexão com sua origem.<br/><br />Nota: você não pode configurar como origem o mesmo domínio de entrega usado para sua entrega de conteúdo. A origem deve ter seu próprio endereço. |\n| [Origin Protocol Policy](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/load-balancer/#origin-protocol-policy) | A Origin Protocol Policy define como a Azion se conectará à origem. Se você optar por preservar o protocolo, a Azion usará o mesmo ao se conectar à origem. Na arquitetura de proxy reverso adotada pela Azion, os usuários se conectam aos Edge Nodes via HTTP ou HTTPS e você escolhe como deseja que a Azion se conecte à sua origem:<br/>Preservar HTTP/HTTPS protocol: manterá o mesmo protocolo de conexão (HTTP ou HTTPS) e portas usadas pelo seu usuário ao acessar seu conteúdo na Azion para se conectar à sua origem.<br/><br />Aplicar HTTP: a conexão entre os Edge Nodes da Azion e sua origem será através de HTTP, independentemente do protocolo de conexão (HTTP ou HTTPS) e das portas usadas pelo seu usuário para acessar o conteúdo da Azion. Com esta nova opção, você pode customizar uma porta diferente da porta padrão (80 para HTTP) para sua origem no campo Address, se desejar.<br/><br />Aplicar HTTPS: a conexão entre os Edge Nodes da Azion e sua origem será através de HTTPS, independentemente do protocolo de conexão (HTTP ou HTTPS) e das portas usadas pelo seu usuário para acessar o conteúdo da Azion. Com esta nova opção, você pode customizar uma porta diferente da porta padrão (443 para HTTPS) para sua origem no campo Address, se desejar. |\n| [Host Header](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/load-balancer/#host-header) | Essa informação é usada para definir qual aplicação deve ser acessada, permitindo que o servidor da origem diferencie os recursos enquanto atende a solicitações de vários nomes de host em um único endereço IP. <br/>Sua origem usa o host header para identificar o virtualhost e localizar seu conteúdo ou aplicação. Ao configurar uma origem no Real-Time Manager, você pode personalizar o valor que a Azion deve enviar no host header.<br /><br />Use o valor `${host}` no campo Host Header se sua origem estiver configurada para responder ao virtualhost para o mesmo domínio que seus usuários usam para acessar o conteúdo na Azion. Dessa forma, você estará instruindo os Edge Nodes a encaminhar o mesmo host header que foi recebido dos seus visitantes para suas origens.<br/><br />Se necessário, você pode preencher um valor customizado do Host Header para que seja enviado à sua origem. <br />Por exemplo, origin.domain.com. Você deve customizar o Host Header se sua origem está configurada para responder um virtualhost em um domínio diferente do usado pelos seus usuários. |\n\n---\n\n### Cache Settings\n\nNesta seção, você irá definir as **opções de cache** para seu conteúdo. Existem dois tipos de cache:\n\n| Campo | Descrição |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Browser Cache Settings](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/edge-caching/#browser-cache-settings) | Browser Cache é o cache do seu conteúdo que é armazenado nos navegadores dos usuários. Você pode definir o time-to-live (TTL) para cada conteúdo. Ainda assim, você tem pouca autonomia para forçar o conteúdo a expirar antes do tempo definido como TTL, caso haja a necessidade de alterar o conteúdo com antecedência. Aqui, você pode escolher entre honrar ou substituir as configurações de cache. Ou seja, o tempo que o conteúdo deve ser mantido no cache do navegador do usuário. <br/><br />Escolha entre Honor Origin Cache Headers ou Override Cache Settings.<br/><br />Use a opção Honor Origin Cache Headers se você quer que a Azion envie aos seus usuários os mesmos headers de controle de cache recebidos da sua origem.<br /><br />Se você escolher Override Cache Settings, você deve inserir o TTL em segundos, que é quanto tempo o conteúdo permanecerá no cache. |\n| [CDN Cache Settings](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/edge-caching/#cdn-cache-settings) | Aqui, você define como o seu conteúdo será armazenado no cache dos Edge Nodes da Azion. Além de configurar o TTL para cada tipo de conteúdo, você poderá realizar a operação de Purge do conteúdo em tempo real sempre que houver necessidade de deletar os dados armazenados no cache.<br /><br />Use a opção Honor Origin Cache Headers se você quer que a Azion respeite os headers de controle de cache recebidos da sua origem para gerenciar o cache nos Edge Nodes da Azion. Você também pode customizar o controle do CDN Cache selecionando a opção Override Cache Settings. Nesse caso, você deve definir um Maximum TTL, que é o tempo de vida máximo (em segundos) que o conteúdo pode ser armazenado em cache nos Edge Nodes da Azion. |\n\nApós definir e configurar as informações anteriores, clique em **Save** para finalizar este passo.\n\nAs abas **Device Groups**, **Error Response**, [Functions](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/edge-functions-instances) e [Rules Engine](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/rules-engine) também podem ser configuradas de acordo com as suas necessidades.\n\nConheça os detalhes sobre o processo de criar e configurar uma edge application assistindo esse vídeo tutorial no canal de YouTube da Azion:\n\n<iframe\nsrc=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tjLtPYLkaFs\"\nloading=\"lazy\"\nwidth=\"600\"\nheight=\"400\"\ntitle=\"Ponto de partida na Azion\"\nframeborder=\"0\"\nallow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\"\nallowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n---\n\n## Passo 4. Crie e configure um domínio para sua Edge Application\n\nAgora que você terminou de configurar sua **Edge Application**, você precisa configurar um [*Domain*](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/domains). Este processo é muito importante, pois é necessário ter *Domínios* configurados para conectar sua aplicação aos outros produtos da Azion.\n\nNo [RTM](https://manager.azion.com/), seu domínio principal (exemplo: `myapp.com`) e todos os seus *subdomínios* (exemplo: `user.myapp.com`) devem ser configurados como um *domínio* próprio.\n\nPara acessar a página de configuração de **Domains**, clique em **Manage your Domains** na página inicial do **RTM**. A página de `Domains` também está disponível no **Products Menu** > **Domains**.\n\n> Se você acabou de criar uma **Edge Application** através do processo *Build from scratch*, a página **Domains** também está disponível na seção **What do you want to do next?** na página **Launch** do RTM.\n\nA página **Domains** lista todas suas **Edge Applications**. Para configurar um **Domain**, siga os passos:\n\n1. Clique no botão **Add Domain**.\n2. Defina um nome para seu domínio e o insira no campo **Add Configuration Name**.\n  > Você pode usar o mesmo nome do seu domínio.\n3. Selecione o [**Digital Certificate**](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/digital-certificates) que irá utilizar. Você pode usar o padrão, *Azion (SAN)*, ou qualquer outro certificado gerado por uma certificadora terceira.\n4. Escreva todos os [Canonical Names (CNAMES)](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/domains/#cname) que seu domínio tem, um por linha, sem pontuação.\n5. Ative o switch **CNAME Access Only** caso queira que seus usuários acessem sua aplicação apenas pelo CNAME.\n6. Em **Edge Application**, selecione a aplicação com a qual quer configurar o domínio.\n7. Certifique-se de que o botão **Active** está ligado.\n8. Clique no botão **Save**.\n\n### Informações detalhadas sobre os campos obrigatórios para adicionar um certificado em Domains\n\n| Campo | Descrição   |\n|-------|-------------|\n| [Digital Certificate](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/digital-certificates) | A configuração usual é usar o certificado da *Azion (SAN)*. Se quiser adicionar outro certificado, acesse o **Products Menu** no **RTM** e procure a seção **Digital Certificates**.<br /><br />Se você selecionou HTTP e HTTPS durante a criação de sua **Edge Application**, você deve selecionar o certificado TLS que será usado para criptografar seu tráfego HTTPS. |\n| [CNAMEs](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/domains/#cname) | Configure a lista de domínios de entrega (CNAMEs) da sua aplicação. Se necessário, você pode usar um *Wildcard Domain* (domínio curinga), como `*.seudominio.com`. <br /><br />Liste os domínios que você deseja usar como URL, um por linha.<br /><br />Assim, você substitui o endereço fornecido pela Azion (exemplo: `<edge_application_id>.map.azionedge.net`) com os domínios listados.<br /><br />Nesse caso, você precisa registrar os CNAMEs em seu provedor de DNS para redirecionar quaisquer rotas do seu CNAME para as indicadas pela Azion.<br /><br /> Na página de configuração do seu DNS, dentro do painel de usuário do seu provedor de DNS, `www.seudomínio.com` por `<edge_application_id>.map.azionedge.net`. |\n| CNAME Access Only | Por padrão, todas as configurações de domínio recebem automaticamente um nome de domínio `map.azionedge.net`.<br /><br />Ao marcar esta opção, você estará configurando sua **Edge Application** para entregar seu conteúdo somente por meio dos domínios listados no campo CNAME. |\n| [Edge Application](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application) | Selecione a **Edge Application** que você deseja associar a este domínio. |\n\n> Saiba mais sobre [**Digital Certificates**](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/digital-certificates).\n\n---\n\n## Passo 5. Vincule o tráfego da sua aplicação à plataforma da Azion\nAgora que você associou seu *Domain Name System (DNS)* próprio a sua **Edge Application** no **RTM**, é necessário configurá-lo no painel de usuário do seu provedor de DNS. Seu provedor de DNS precisa saber para onde encaminhar e o que retornar para usuários que acessam seu domínio.\n\n> Este processo não irá simplesmente `redirecionar` usuários que acessam `seudominio.com` para `<edge_application_id>.map.azionedge.net`, mas vincular sua aplicação ao seu DNS — e todos os CNAMES associados a ela.\n\nVocê também pode utilizar o **Intelligent DNS** para criar, hostear e tornar seus domínios mais seguros. Conheça mais sobre **Domínios** e como o [**Intelligent DNS**](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/intelligent-dns) funciona.\n\nSe seu domínio é fornecido por provedores de DNS, como, por exemplo, GoDaddy, OpenDNS, Namecheap e outros, essa configuração deve ser feita no painel de usuário do seu provedor de DNS.\n\nPara apontar sua aplicação ao seu novo DNS, abra o *painel de usuário* do seu provedor de DNS e procure por seções como \"*Configuração de DNS*\" ou \"*Gerencie seus DNS*\".\n\n> Essa configuração pode variar dependendo do seu provedor de DNS.\n\nDentro da página de configuração do seu DNS, **adicione o link** de sua **Edge Application** (`<edge_application_id>.map.azionedge.net`) no campo **DNS Host Record**.\n\nSalve e, após alguns minutos, verifique se o domínio está funcionando.\n\nVocê também pode confirmar se seu tráfego está apontando para sua aplicação através do [**Real-Time Metrics**](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/real-time-metrics).\n\nAgora, sua **Edge Application** deve estar acessível através do seu DNS como URL.\n\n",

No caso de TLS, inclui tempo gasto em handshake. **`0` no caso de KeepAlive e `-` no caso de cache.** |\n| $upstream_header_time | Tempo, em milissegundos, para que o edge receba os cabeçalhos de resposta da origem. Exemplo: 0.345. **No caso de cache, a resposta é `-`.** |\n| $upstream_response_time | Tempo, em milisegundos, para o edge receber uma resposta padrão da origem, incluindo cabeçalhos e corpo. Exemplo: 0.876. **No caso de cache, a resposta é `-`.** |\n| $upstream_status | Código de status HTTP da origem. Se um servidor não pode ser selecionado, a variável mantém o código de status 502 (Bad Gateway). **No caso de cache, a resposta é `-`.** |\n| $waf_attack_action | Informa a ação do WAF em relação à ação. Pode ser: $BLOCK, $PASS, $LEARNING_BLOCK ou $LEARNING_PASS. |\n| $waf_attack_family | Informa a classificação da infração de WAF detectada na requisição. Exemplo: SQL, XSS, TRAVERSAL, entre outras. |\n| $waf_block | Informa se o WAF bloqueou ou não a ação. `0` quando não bloqueado e `1` quando bloqueado. Quando em `Learning Mode`, ele não será bloqueado, independentemente do retorno. |\n| $waf_headers | Quando os cabeçalhos de solicitação enviados pelo usuário são analisados pelo módulo WAF e marcados como **blocked**, `$waf_block = 1`. Tem uma string codificada em base64. Caso contrário, ele terá um traço `-`. Aplica-se aos modos `WAF Learning` ou `Blocking`. |\n| $waf_learning | Informa se o WAF está em Learning Mode. Pode ser `0` ou `1`. |\n| $waf_match | Lista de infrações encontradas na requisição do usuário final. É formada por elementos chave-valor: a *chave* é referente ao tipo de infração detectada; o *valor* apresenta a string que gerou a infração. |\n| $waf_score | Informa a pontuação que será incrementada em caso de match com as regras criadas para o WAF. |\n| $waf_total_blocked | Informa o número total de requisições bloqueadas. |\n| $waf_total_processed | Informa o número total de requisições processadas. |\n\n> Você pode adicionar a variável **$traceback** em um custom template com o data source Edge Applications se você tem ativada a opção de *Debug rules* em sua aplicação. Veja mais em [Debugging rules em Edge Application](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/rules-engine/#debugging-rules).\n\nAs variáveis: `$upstream_bytes_received`; `$upstream_cache_status`; `$upstream_connect_time`; `$upstream_header_time`; `$upstream_response_time` e `$upstream_status` podem apresentar *mais de um elemento separado por vírgula*. Quando uma conexão é disparada, seja por redirecionamento interno ou escolha de origem com [Load Balancer](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/load-balancer/), por exemplo, cada valor contido no campo representa a respectiva conexão iniciada. O campo pode ser separado por:\n\n- Uma vírgula, representando múltiplos IPs.\n- Dois-pontos, representando redirecionamento interno.\n\nSe vários servidores foram contatados durante o processamento da solicitação, seus endereços são separados por vírgulas, por exemplo: `192.168.1.1:80, 192.168.1.2:80`.\n\nSe ocorre um redirecionamento interno de um grupo de servidores para outro, iniciado por *X-Accel-Redirect* ou *Error Responses*, os endereços de servidores de diferentes grupos são separados por *dois-pontos*. Exemplo: `192.168.1.1:80, 192.168.1.2:80, unix:/tmp/sock : 192.168.10.1:80, 192.168.10.2:80`.\n\nSe um servidor não puder ser selecionado, a variável mantém o nome do grupo de servidores.\n\nConsiderando vários valores como transições na conexão, o último valor tende a ser o mais importante. Se você usa o recurso *Error Responses* nas suas edge applications, você verá dois valores nos campos *upstream* que representam o status da origem e o resultado da solicitação feita para que o conteúdo seja entregue. Em casos normais, você terá `502: 200`.\n\n*502* é o código de erro HTTP para a resposta da primeira tentativa de obter conteúdo do servidor de origem. Como ele retornou um erro *502*, considerando que você configurou uma *Error Responses* para o status *502*, outra solicitação será feita para que o URI seja definido. Em seguida, a página será entregue e o status HTTP será adicionado aos campos *upstream*, respeitando sua posição para todos eles. Neste exemplo, o resultado é a composição `502 : 200`.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Functions\n\nO data source **Edge Functions** exibe os dados referentes às solicitações feitas para suas [edge functions](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/edge-functions/) na Azion.

Exemplo: api-login.azion.com.br |\n| $waf_uri | URI usada na requisição do WAF. Exemplo: /access/v2/after-login |\n\n---\n\n## Usar um template\nUm template no **Data Streaming** fornece o conjunto de variáveis pré-configuradas disponíveis para cada data source em um formato adequado para a transferência dos seus registros de eventos. Após selecionar o seu data source, você pode:\n\n- Selecionar o template correspondente, fornecido pela Azion.\n- Personalizar seu próprio template, escolhendo quais variáveis quer usar.\n\nVocê encontra quatro templates fornecidos pela Azion e um **Custom Template**, que permite que você decida quais variáveis serão usadas. Os templates estão disponíveis na lista suspensa **Template** e as variáveis para os templates são exibidas no campo de código **Data Set** em formato JSON.\n\nVeja qual template corresponde a qual data source:\n\n| Data Source | Template |\n| --- | --- |\n| Activity History | Activity History Collector |\n| Edge Applications | Edge Applications + WAF Event Collector |\n| Edge Functions | Edge Functions Event Collector |\n| WAF Events | WAF Event Collector |\n| todos | Custom Template |\n\nAo selecionar um dos templates fornecidos pela Azion, você não consegue modificar as variáveis exibidas no campo de código **Data Set**. Ao selecionar **Custom Template**, você consegue personalizar quais variáveis quer usar de acordo com suas necessidades.\n\n> Veja o guia [Como criar um template personalizado no Data Streaming](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/data-streaming-template-personalizado/) para mais informações sobre como personalizar o seu **Data Set**.\n\n---\n\n## Associar domínios\n\nVocê pode associar os seus [domínios existentes](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/domains/) registrados na Azion ao seu data streaming. Se você ainda não tem um domínio registrado na sua conta, veja a documentação sobre [Criar um novo domínio associado a sua edge application](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/ponto-de-partida/#criar-dominio).\n\nAo associar um domínio, os eventos relacionados a esse ou a esses domínios específicos são coletados e enviados para seu endpoint. Você pode associar um ou mais domínios e você tem a opção de filtrar domínios com **Filter Domains** ou selecionar todos os domínios com **All Domains**.\n\nAo selecionar **All Domains**, a plataforma seleciona automaticamente todos os domínios atuais e *futuros* de sua conta no RTM.\n\n> Veja o guia [Como associar domínios no Data Streaming](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/data-streaming-associar-dominios/) para mais informações sobre como usar esse campo.\n\nSe você selecionar a opção **All Domains**, você também pode configurar a porcentagem de dados que quer receber, de forma aleatória, do seu data streaming através da opção de *Sampling*. Além de filtrar por amostra, a opção também reduz custos de coleta e análise de dados.\n\n> No momento, a opção *Sampling* não está disponíveis para todas as contas do RTM. Se você deseja usá-la em sua conta, [contate nosso time de vendas](https://www.azion.com/pt-br/contate-vendas/).\n\nO campo **Sampling (%)** deve conter a porcentagem de dados que quer receber. Essa porcentagem retornará dados relacionados a todos os seus domínios.\n\nQuando a opção de Sampling está habilitada, você só pode adicionar *um* data streaming em sua conta. Após esse data streaming ser desabilitado, a opção **Add Streaming** é habilitada novamente na tela do Data Streaming no RTM.\n\n---\n\n## Definir um endpoint\n\nO *endpoint* é o destino para onde você quer enviar os dados coletados pela Azion, que costuma ser uma plataforma de processamento de stream ou uma ferramenta de análise que você já usa. O tipo de endpoint representa o método que você quer configurar como destino para os seus dados.\n\nA Azion suporta os seguintes endpoints:\n\n- [Apache Kafka](#apache-kafka)\n- [AWS Kinesis Data Firehose](#aws-kinesis-data-firehose)\n- [Azure Blob Storage](#azure-blob-storage)\n- [Azure Monitor](#azure-monitor)\n- [Datadog](#datadog)\n- [Elasticsearch](#elasticsearch)\n- [Google BigQuery](#google-bigquery)\n- [IBM QRadar](#ibm-qradar)\n- [Simple Storage Service (S3)](#s3)\n- [Splunk](#splunk)\n- [Standard HTTP/HTTPS POST](#standard-http-https-post)\n\n> Não encontrou nesta lista o conector de endpoint que você está procurando? Participe de uma pesquisa rápida sobre [conectores do Data Streaming](https://forms.gle/jhUTEsoqbdn174j59) e compartilhe quais você usa e gostaria de encontrar aqui.\n\nPara configurar um endpoint, você deve selecionar um **Endpoint Type** na lista suspensa do RTM.

Campos marcados com asterisco `*` no RTM são obrigatórios.\n\n---\n\n### Apache Kafka\n\nPara configurar o endpoint [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart), você deve ter acesso à plataforma para obter as seguintes informações:\n\n- **Bootstrap Servers**: os servidores — hosts e portas — no cluster do Kafka. Você pode adicionar um ou mais servidores Kafka separando-os com vírgula `,` e *sem espaços*. Devem estar neste formato: `myownhost.com:2021,imaginaryhost.com:4525,anotherhost:4030`.\n\nNão é necessário incluir todos os servidores de seu cluster nesse campo, mas apenas alguns dos servidores que serão usados para a conexão inicial.\n\n> É recomendado que você use mais de um servidor para aumentar a redundância e a disponibilidade.\n\n- **Kafka Topic**: nome do tópico do seu cluster Kafka para o qual o Data Streaming deve enviar mensagens. Este campo aceita apenas *um* tópico. Exemplo: `azure.analytics.fct.pageviews.0`\n\n- **Transport Layer Security (TLS)**: opção para fazer envios criptografados usando o *Transport Layer Security (TLS)*. O TLS é um protocolo criptográfico projetado para fornecer segurança de comunicação em uma rede de computadores e é amplamente usado como uma camada de segurança de HTTP. Para usar a opção, selecione **Yes**.\n\nSe você deseja usar esse protocolo, certifique-se de que o endpoint que irá receber os dados esteja devidamente protegido com um certificado digital emitido por uma *_*Certificate Authority (CA)* reconhecida globalmente, como IndenTrust, DigiCert, Sectigo, GoDaddy, GlobalSign ou Let’s Encrypt.\n\nA variável de TLS `use_tls` recebe `true` ou `false` para ativar/desativar seu uso.\n\n---\n\n### AWS Kinesis Data Firehose\n\n> Ao usar o endpoint AWS Kinesis Data Firehose, seus eventos são agrupados em blocos de até 500 registros, em vez do padrão de 2000, ou a cada 60 segundos, o que ocorrer primeiro.\n\nPara configurar o endpoint [AWS Kinesis Data Firehose](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose/), você deve ter acesso à plataforma para obter as seguintes informações:\n\n- **Stream Name**: refere-se ao nome do stream que o usuário definiu ao criar o Kinesis Data Firehose.

Exemplo: `https://app.domain.com/`\n- **Custom Headers** (*opcional*): o *nome* e o *valor* para cada cabeçalho para enviar para o endpoint. Você pode informar  um ou mais cabeçalhos customizados para a sua requisição HTTP/HTTPS. Exemplo: `header-name:value`\n\n---\n\n## Personalizar o payload\n\n> Esta funcionalidade só está disponível para o endpoint **Standard HTTP/HTTPS POST**.\n\nAo usar o endpoint Standard HTTP/HTTPS POST, o payload para o seu endpoint não é pré-definido. Você tem a opção de personalizar as informações essenciais que serão enviadas em seus dados da forma que achar melhor.\n\nPara personalizar o payload enviado pelo conector no **Data Streaming**, você tem os seguintes campos:\n\n- **Max Size** (*opcional*): define, em bytes, o tamanho de pacotes de dados que serão enviados. Aceita valores a partir de *1000000*.\n- **Log Line Separator** (*opcional*): define que informação será usada no fim de cada linha de registro (log). Usado para quebrar informações em linhas diferentes.\n- **Payload Format** (*opcional*): define qual informação será enviada em seus dados para cada requisição de data streaming.\n\nPor padrão, o Data Streaming recomenda o formato NDJSON com o uso de `\\n` como um log line separator e $dataset como payload format, que usa as informações fornecidas no campo de código **Data Set**, descrevendo as variáveis escolhidas como template.\n\nVocê pode escolher outras opções para ambos os campos. Dependendo dos tipos de seus registros, você pode usar `,` como log line separator, por exemplo.\n\nO formato NDJSON não usa os arrays típicos de JSON `[]`, e cada dado é apresentado em uma linha diferente, sem vírgula separando-as. Ele pode ser útil para dados estruturados com processamentos de um registro por vez. Já o formato JSON é o mais conhecido e possui tabulação de dados, usando arrays `[]` e sendo separado por vírgulas. Com ele, o payload pode ser tratado como um registro individual.\n\nPor exemplo, se o **Log Line Separator** receber `,` e o **Payload Format** receber `[$dataset]`, e o template tem as seguintes variáveis no campo de código **Data Set**:\n\n$request_method\\\n$host\\\n$status\n\nVocê receberá uma resposta em JSON semelhante a isso:\n\n```json\n    [\n        {\n            \"request_method\": \"GET\",\n            \"host\": \"www.onedomain.com\",\n          \"status\": \"200\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"request_method\": \"POST\",\n            \"host\": \"www.anotherdomain.com.br\",\n            \"status\": \"200\"\n        }\n    ]\n```\n\nMas se o **Log Line Separator** receber `\\n` e o **Payload Format** receber `$dataset`, você receberá uma resposta em NDJSON semelhante a isso:\n\n```json\n{\"request_method\": \"GET\", \"host\": \"www.onedomain.com\", \"status\": \"200\"}\n{\"request_method\": \"POST\", \"host\": \"www.anotherdomain.com.br\", \"status\": \"200\"}\n```\n\n### Personalizando o payload com Activity History\n\nVocê pode personalizar o payload com informações específicas se você está usando o data source [Activity History](#activity-history) e o endpoint [Standard HTTP/HTTPS POST](#standard-http-https-post).\n\nAs seguintes informações devem ser usadas nos campos de payload para configurá-lo:\n\n- **Log Line Separator**: \\n\n- **Payload Format**: 'v1\\t$time_iso8601\\t$clientid\\t$title\\t$comment\\t$type\\t$author_name\\t$author_email'\n\n---\n\n## Status code\n\nOs servidores do **Data Streaming** funcionam em duas etapas: monitoram os endpoints uma vez por minuto (1x/min) e declaram o endpoint como *available*, disponível, ou *unavailable*, indisponível.\n\nO Data Streaming tenta enviar mensagens para endpoints que estão *available*. Se o endpoint estiver *unavailable*, as mensagens não são enviadas, pois as informações são descartadas. No minuto seguinte, o Data Streaming faz o envio dos dados novamente se o endpoint ficar *available*.\n\nPara ser considerado como *available*, o endpoint deve ser aprovado por todos os servidores da Azion. Se um dos servidores indicar que o endpoint está *unavailable*, as mensagens não são enviadas.\n\n### Comportamento do status HTTP 504\n\nOcorre quando o endpoint responde ao teste com sucesso, mas não recebe as mensagens dentro do tempo de timeout: *20 segundos* para endpoints do tipo HTTP POST.\n\n### Comportamento do status HTTP 503\n\nOcorre quando o endpoint é declarado como *unavailable*, indisponível, pela monitoração do endpoint. Portanto, o Data Streaming não tenta enviar as mensagens.\n\nComo o sistema é distribuído, não é possível saber qual o servidor específico que envia as mensagens para cada endpoint.\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n**Application Acceleration** é um módulo de **Edge Application** que acelera aplicações web e APIs através da otimização de protocolo e do gerenciamento de requisitos de conteúdo dinâmico. Esse módulo habilita a funcionalidade **Advanced Cache Key**, bem como novas opções para regras personalizadas usando [Rules Engine](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/rules-engine/), e provê suporte a métodos HTTP.\n\n---\n\n## Como funciona\n\nO **Application Acceleration** é um módulo do **Edge Application** que otimiza protocolos e gerencia os diferentes requisitos de conteúdo estático e dinâmico para acelerar o desempenho de aplicativos web e APIs.\n\nAo manter os processos dentro dos edge nodes da Azion, o Application Acceleration pode ajudar a aumentar o desempenho das APIs e diminuir a complexidade da infraestrutura no backend.\n\nCom o Application Acceleration, você pode:\n\n- Criar regras avançadas no [Rules Engine](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/rules-engine/) para as fases HTTP *request* e *response*.\n- Utilizar a funcionalidade **Advanced Cache Key**, que permite personalizar políticas de cache para conteúdo dinâmico.\n- Ter suporte aos métodos POST, PUT, PATCH e DELETE para Edge Application, bem como aos métodos GET, HEAD e OPTIONS suportados nativamente.\n- Alterar o [TTL de cache da CDN](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/edge-caching/#cdn-cache-settings) para valores abaixo de 60 segundos.\n\n---\n\n## Advanced Cache Key\n\nPor padrão, a Azion considera cada URL como um objeto distinto no cache. A funcionalidade **Advanced Cache Key** permite que você crie regras avançadas de *cache key* baseadas em duas opções: [Query String](#cache-by-query-string) ou [Cookies](#cache-by-cookie). Se necessário, você pode usar ambas as opções para definir a segmentação do conteúdo de sua aplicação.\n\n> Consulte o guia [Como configurar a Advanced Cache Key para Edge Application](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/desempenho-apis-sites-application-acceleration/).\n\n### Cache by Query String\n\nNa Azion, você define como deseja que o conteúdo seja armazenado em cache de acordo com variações de **Query String** em suas URLs:\n\n- **Content does not vary by Query String (Improves Caching)**: define que a *cache key* deve ignorar a Query String. Ou seja, duas URLs distintas apenas pela variação da Query String serão consideradas o mesmo objeto em cache. Por exemplo, `http://seudominio.com/path?queryA` e `http://seudominio.com/path?queryB` irão entregar o mesmo conteúdo do cache para seus usuários.\n\n- **Content varies by some Query String fields (Allowed rules)**: você pode listar quais campos da Query String devem ser considerados para diferenciar os objetos no cache da Azion. Todos os demais campos serão ignorados. Por exemplo, se você listar o campo `cidade`, as URLs `http://seudominio.com/path?cidade=A&nome=X` e `http://seudominio.com/path?cidade=A&nome=Y` serão consideradas um único objeto em cache, enquanto as URLs `http://seudominio.com/path?cidade=A&nome=X` e `http://seudominio.com/path?cidade=B&nome=X` serão consideradas objetos distintos.\n\n- **Content varies by Query String, except for some fields (Blacklist)**: você pode listar quais campos da Query String devem ser ignorados ao diferenciar os objetos em cache. Todos os demais campos serão considerados. Por exemplo, se você listar o campo `random`, as URLs `http://seudominio.com/path?cidade=A&random=123` e `http://seudominio.com/path?cidade=B&random=123` serão consideradas objetos distintos em cache, enquanto `http://seudominio.com/path?cidade=A&random=123` e `http://seudominio.com/path?cidade=A&random=456` serão consideradas o mesmo objeto em cache.\n\n- **Content varies by all Query String fields**: define que a cache key deve considerar todos os campos da Query String. Ou seja, duas URLs distintas pela variação da Query String serão consideradas dois objetos distintos em cache. Por exemplo, `http://seudominio.com/path?queryA` e `http://seudominio.com/path?queryB` serão armazenadas como objetos distintos no cache da Azion.\n\nPara aumentar a eficiência do cache, você pode ativar a opção **Query String Sort**. Se ativada, ela ordena todos os campos da query string, fazendo com que a posição dos campos seja irrelevante na definição da cache key. Se a posição dos campos é relevante para diferenciar o seu conteúdo, você deve desativar essa opção.\n\n### Cache by Cookie\n\nVocê pode também distinguir os objetos no cache da Azion por nome/valor de cookies.\n\n- **Content does not vary by Cookies (Improves Caching)**:  considera a URL para diferenciar objetos no cache da Azion, não levando em consideração os cookies.\n\n- **Content varies by some Cookies (Allowed rules)**: você pode listar o nome dos cookies que sua aplicação utiliza para diferenciar os objetos em cache. Todos os demais cookies serão ignorados, permitindo segmentar seu conteúdo por perfis de usuários e outras configurações. Esta é a opção mais recomendada se você utiliza cookies para gerenciar sessões de usuários.\n\n- **Content varies by Cookies, with the exception of a few (Blocklist)**: você pode listar o nome dos cookies que deseja ignorar na definição da *cache key*, considerando todos os cookies com exceção dos listados.\n\n- **Content varies by all Cookies**: além da URL, considera todos os cookies para diferenciar objetos no cache da Azion.\n\n> **Dica**: utilize essa funcionalidade para segmentar seu conteúdo por perfil de usuário, por sessão de navegação, por região de acesso ou conforme sua necessidade de segmentação de conteúdo.\n\n---\n\n## Bypass Cache\n\nVocê também pode utilizar a Azion para entregar seu conteúdo dinâmico e personalizado, mesmo quando parte de seu conteúdo não puder ser cacheado na infraestrutura da Azion. Na Azion, você define as regras de cache por *path*. Crie uma regra de **Bypass Cache** para os paths de seu site que não puderem ser cacheados em nossa infraestrutura.\n\nAtravés do Bypass Cache, você configura o serviço da Azion para repassar todas as requisições a um *path* diretamente para sua origem. Contudo, você contará com importantes otimizações de protocolo para acelerar sua aplicação e conexão *keepalive* entre os edge nodes da Azion e sua origem sempre que possível.\n\n> Consulte o guia [Como configurar a políticas de cache para Edge Application](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/edge-caching/#bypass-cache) para mais informações sobre o uso de Bypass Cache.\n\n### Diferença entre Bypass Cache e TTL 0\n\nHá uma diferença de comportamento entre **Bypass Cache** e cache com **Maximum time-to-live (TTL)** definido em 0 (zero) segundos.\n\nTanto o comportamento **Bypass Cache** e o **Maximum TTL** em zero segundos permitem otimizar a entrega de conteúdo e reduzir os tempos de carregamento na origem, mas seus efeitos são levemente diferentes.\n\nAo usar o comportamento Bypass Cache, todas as solicitações HTTP e HTTPS recebidas pelos edge nodes da Azion serão enviadas para a origem, sem armazenar nenhum conteúdo em cache. Utilize o Bypass Cache se você quiser fornecer conteúdo diferente para cada solicitação de usuário.\n\nNo entanto, ao definir o TTL em 0 (zero) segundos, várias solicitações em paralelo aos edge nodes da Azion serão enviadas como uma única solicitação à origem. Nesse caso, os edge nodes da Azion também validam as alterações no conteúdo com sua origem usando o parâmetro *If-Modified-Since*. Se o objeto não tiver sido alterado desde a última solicitação, o conteúdo não precisará ser transferido novamente, o que pode resultar em uma resposta *304 Not Modified* muito mais rápida. Além disso, o TTL máximo de cache em 0 ainda irá gerar um objeto de cache que vive por 999 milissegundos.\n\n> **Dica**: você pode definir o TTL como zero se o conteúdo dinâmico, que varia em um determinado tempo, puder ser entregue de forma idêntica a todos os usuários que fizerem solicitações simultâneas.\n\n---\n\n## Forward Cookies\n\nSe sua origem gerencia cookies de aplicações, talvez você precise da funcionalidade **Forward Cookies**. Por padrão, a Azion filtra o cabeçalho de resposta `Set-Cookie` enviado por sua origem. Se desejar, você pode configurar para que o `Set-Cookie` seja repassado para seus usuários.\n\nAo utilizar a funcionalidade Forward Cookies, você determina que a Azion encaminhe para seus usuários o cabeçalho `Set-Cookie` proveniente de sua origem, mesmo na situação de conteúdo em cache (*cache hit*). Para evitar que um usuário receba `Set-Cookie` de sessão de outro usuário, você deve listar todos os cookies de sessão (cookies privados) de sua aplicação usando a [Advanced Cache Key](#cache-by-cookie).\n\n> Consulte o guia [Como configurar a políticas de cache para Edge Application](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/edge-caching/#forward-cookies) para mais informações sobre Forward Cookies.\n\n### JavaScript Cookies\n\nUma alternativa ao envio do cabeçalho de resposta `Set-Cookie` é a criação de cookies por **JavaScript**, que permite criar, ler e expirar cookies através da propriedade `document.cookie`.\n\nO [JavaScript cookie](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_cookies.asp) deve possuir o seguinte formato:\n\n```js\ndocument.cookie = “username=John Doe; expires=Thu, 18 Dec 2013 12:00:00 UTC; path=/”;\n```\n\nPor padrão, a Azion não irá filtrar o Request Header `Cookie`, independentemente de sua configuração de **Forward Cookies**. Sendo assim, JavaScript Cookies poderão ser enviados para sua origem para viabilizar o gerenciamento de sua aplicação.\n\n---\n\n## Suporte a métodos HTTP\n\nOs métodos HTTP `GET`, `HEAD` e `OPTIONS` já têm suporte nativo em qualquer edge application. Ao ativar o **Application Acceleration**, você poderá usar os métodos `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH` e `DELETE`.\n",

    "body": "\n**Device Groups** é uma capacidade de **Edge Application** que permite identificar os dispositivos que enviam requisições à sua aplicação e categorizá-los em grupos. Você pode usar Device Groups para definir comportamentos personalizados e definir políticas de cache com base nos grupos que você criar.\n\n---\n\n## Como funciona\n\nUsuários que acessam aplicações criadas com o [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com) enviam dados para a Azion através de HTTP *request headers*, ou cabeçalhos de requisição. O cabeçalho `User-Agent` guarda informações sobre o navegador do usuário, sistema operacional, versão e fabricante. O cabeçalho possui a seguinte sintaxe:\n\n```yaml\nUser-Agent: <product>/<product-version> <comment>\n```\n\n**Sendo:**\n\n- `product`: identificador de produto.\n- `product-version`: versão do produto.\n- `comment`: informação sobre o sistema, plataformas e extensões.\n\nPor exemplo, o seguinte cabeçalho `User-Agent` aponta para um acesso de um sistema operacional Windows usando o navegador Mozilla Firefox:\n\n```yaml\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/47.0\n```\n\n**Device Groups** identifica se uma expressão regular definida por você se encaixa no conteúdo do cabeçalho `User-Agent`. Uma vez que você cria um grupo, você pode configurar uma regra ou uma política de cache especificamente para os dispositivos contidos no grupo.\n\n---\n\n## Uso\n\n**Device Groups** podem ser usados para identificar e categorizar os dispositivos que enviam requisições à sua aplicação.\n\nPor exemplo, você pode criar um grupo chamado *Mobile* cuja expressão regular deve corresponder ao conteúdo dentro do cabeçalho `User-Agent` que identifica dispositivos móveis. A seguinte expressão pode ser utilizada para identificar a maioria dos dispositivos móveis existentes:\n\n```\n(Mobile|iP(hone|od)|BlackBerry|IEMobile)\n```\n\nO grupo *Mobile* pode então ser referenciado na guia **Rules Engine** de sua aplicação ou na guia **Cache Settings**.\n\n### Rules Engine\n\nQuando você cria uma regra, você pode utilizar a variável `${device_group}` no **Rules Engine** para definir quais comportamentos sua aplicação deve executar para os grupos que você criou. Para fazer referência a um grupo de dispositivos, você pode adicionar seu nome à seção de argumentos depois de selecionar o operador de comparação desejado.\n\n> Para ativar esta variável, você deve habilitar [Application Acceleration](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/application-acceleration/).\n\nO seguinte critério identifica se a solicitação do usuário vem de um dispositivo que corresponda a um grupo de dispositivos chamado *Mobile*:\n\n|  | Variável | Operador de comparação | Argumento |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| If | `${device_group}` | is equal to | Mobile |\n\nO **Rules Engine** também pode ser usado para identificar dispositivos utilizando a variável `${http_user_agent}` diretamente, adicionando uma *string* ou expressão regular como argumento. Dessa forma, você pode identificar dispositivos específicos sem ter que dedicar um grupo de dispositivos a eles.\n\nOs seguintes critérios identificam se a requisição do usuário vem de um dispositivo *iPhone*:\n\n|  | Variável | Operador de comparação | Argumento |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| If | `${http_user_agent}` | matches | `(?i)iPhone` |\n\n[Saiba mais sobre o Rules Engine](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/rules-engine/).\n\n---\n\n### Adaptive Delivery\n\nNa guia **Cache Settings** de **Edge Application**, você pode referenciar um grupo de dispositivos existente para **Adaptive Delivery**.\n\nAo escolher a opção **Content varies by some Device Groups (Whitelist)**, você permite que a Azion mantenha variações baseadas em dispositivos de seus objetos no cache.\n\n> Você pode escolher um ou mais grupos para aplicar as mesmas políticas de Adaptive Delivery. Para ativar essa funcionalidade, [entre em contato com nossa equipe de vendas](https://www.azion.com/pt-br/contate-vendas/).\n\n[Saiba mais sobre Cache Settings](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/edge-caching/).\n\n---\n\n## Priorização\n\n**Device Groups** priorizam combinações em sequência, independentemente da ordem dentro do cabeçalho `User-Agent` da solicitação. Dada a seguinte lista de grupos:\n\n| Device Group | Expressão regular |\n| --- | --- |\n| Mobile | `(Mobile|Android)` |\n| Tablet | `(iPad|Android)` |\n| Desktop | `(Chrome|Mozilla)` |\n\nSe a requisição for feita por um dispositivo que contenha `Android Tablet Mobile (Mozilla Firefox)` em seu cabeçalho, as palavras `Android` e `Mobile` corresponderão ao grupo *Mobile*.\n\nPara uma solicitação de um dispositivo `iPad Apple Webkit Mobile`, ele também será identificado como *Mobile* devido à presença de `Mobile` dentro da solicitação, apesar do `iPad` corresponder ao grupo de dispositivos *Tablet*.\n\nAo estabelecer suas regras, lembre-se que cabeçalhos `User-Agent` para dispositivos diferentes podem conter as mesmas palavras. Por exemplo: `Google Chrome Android` provavelmente identifica um dispositivo móvel enquanto `Google Chrome Symbian` é um cabeçalho que identifica um computador; ambos utilizaram a mesma aplicação Google Chrome para acessar a aplicação. Certifique-se de ser preciso ao criar grupos de dispositivos.\n\n\n",

    "body": "\nVocê precisa de um certificado TLS para transferir dados por HTTPS. O uso do protocolo HTTPS com um certificado garante que os dados de seus clientes sejam transferidos com segurança pela Internet, demonstra a confiabilidade de seu site e a autenticidade de seu domínio, e melhora a posição de seu site em mecanismos de busca como o Google.\n\nNa Azion, você pode contar com as seguintes opções de certificados TLS para tráfego HTTPS:\n\n- **Azion SAN certificate**: registra seu domínio como Subject Alternate Name (SAN) no certificado da Azion.\n- **Custom certificate**: registra seu certificado TLS pessoal obtido de uma autoridade de certificação (CA).\n- **Let's Encrypt certificate**: solicita a emissão de um certificado *Let's Encrypt*™ gerenciado automaticamente pela Azion.\n\nVocê também pode criar um **Certificate Signing Request (CSR)** pela Azion para requisitar um certificado a uma CA.\n\n---\n\n## Azion SAN certificate\n\nAo utilizar o Azion **Edge Application**, você conta com um certificado TLS para tráfego em HTTPS sem custo adicional. Quando você cria um domínio para sua edge application usando o [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/), um endereço na zona `azionedge.net` é atribuído automaticamente.\n\nSe desejar, você pode utilizar o domínio atribuído para entregar seu conteúdo estático sobre HTTPS, evitando os custos de emissão de certificados TLS para ambientes de homologação ou URLs cujo domínio possa ser compartilhado com outros clientes da Azion. Desse modo, seu domínio será registrado como Subject Alternative Name (SAN) sob o certificado TLS da Azion.\n\n---\n\n## Custom certificate\n\nSe você quiser alterar seu domínio, você pode registrar seu próprio certificado TLS (X.509) no [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/) sem custo adicional. Para utilização desse recurso, você precisará comprovar a propriedade do domínio.\n\nPara adicionar seu Custom Certificate, você precisará do par Certificado (X.509) e da respectiva chave privada, ambos no formato [ASCII PEM](https://www.google.com.br/search?q=Como+converter+um+certificado+PFX+para+PEM&cad=h). A chave privada não pode estar protegida por *passphrase*.\n\n### Validação\n\nHá três tipos de validação que você pode escolher:\n\n| Domain Validation (DV) | Organization Validation (OV) | Extended Validation (EV) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Validação sobre o seu direito de uso do domínio, sendo a mais simples das três opções. Esta é a opção recomendada pela Azion para a maioria das empresas. | Validação sobre o seu direito de uso do domínio e mais algumas validações sobre a organização requisitante. | Validação estendida que exige documentações adicionais para comprovação sobre a existência física, legal e operacional da organização requisitante, sendo a mais complexa das três opções. |\n\n### Tipos de criptografia\n\nAtualmente, a Azion trabalha com dois tipos de certificados: *RSA* e *ECC/ECDSA*. Cada certificado tem sua característica e seu nível de segurança, e a Azion permite que você escolha a opção que se ajusta melhor ao seu cenário.\n\n#### RSA \n\nRivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) é um dos primeiros sistemas de criptografia de chave pública e é amplamente utilizado para transmissão segura de dados. Neste sistema de criptografia, a chave de encriptação é pública e é diferente da chave de decriptação que é secreta (privada).Toda mensagem cifrada usando uma chave pública só pode ser decifrada usando a respectiva chave privada.\n\nO RSA é um algoritmo relativamente lento e, por isso, é menos usado para criptografar diretamente os dados do usuário. Mais frequentemente, o RSA passa chaves criptografadas compartilhadas para criptografia de chave simétrica que, por sua vez, pode executar operações de criptografia-descriptografia em massa a uma velocidade muito maior.\n\n#### ECC/ECDSA\n\nA criptografia de curvas elípticas (ECC), mais especificamente a criptografia *Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm* (ECDSA) para certificados digitais, é um modelo para a criptografia de chave pública com base na estrutura algébrica de curvas elípticas. A criptografia de chave pública é baseada na criação de enigmas matemáticos que são difíceis de resolver — por isso, ele se torna muito mais seguro que outros tipos de certificado, como, por exemplo, o RSA.\n\nChaves menores são menos intensivas computacionalmente para gerar assinaturas porque envolvem números matemáticos menores. ECC é mais rápida na geração de assinaturas e com mais performance sobre RSA.\n\n---\n\n## Certificado Let's Encrypt\n\n[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)™ é uma CA que permite que indivíduos e empresas obtenham, renovem e gerenciem certificados TLS gratuitamente. Quando você [cria um Domínio](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/domains/) com a Azion, você pode escolher obter um um certificado TLS assinado pela Let's Encrypt. Você pode requisitar a criação de certificados Let's Encrypt certificates para domínios hospedados no [Intelligent DNS](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/intelligent-dns/) ou em um provedor de DNS externo.\n\nQaundo você [cria um domínio com a Azion](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/ponto-de-partida/#passo-4-crie-e-configure-um-domínio-para-sua-edge-application), você pode escolher a opção **Let's Encrypt** para gerar automaticamente um certificado Let's Encrypt. Uma entrada para esse certificado será listada na página **Digital Certificates** [no RTM](https://manager.azion.com/). Depois que o certificado for submetido à validação, emissão e armazenamento do DNS, ele se tornará ativo.\n\n> Consulte o guia [Como gerar um certificado Let's Encrypt para o seu domínio](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/como-gerar-um-certificado-lets-encrypt/) para saber como validar esse tipo de certificado.\n\nOs certificados Let's Encrypt ativos *serão renovados automaticamente antes da data de expiração* de 90 dias a partir de sua emissão, desde que você não vincule outro certificado ao domínio ou exclua o domínio associado. Certificados que foram desvinculados podem ser vinculados ao domínio se ainda forem válidos.\n\n### Configuração de CNAMEs\n\nAo criar um domínio com **Domain** da Azion e selecionar a opção **Let's Encrypt certificate**, você pode listar até 50 CNAMEs para solicitar o certificado. Os CNAMEs listados após o domínio de nível superior são registrados como *Subject Alternative Names (SAN)*.\n\nSe você modificar a lista de CNAMEs nas configurações do domínio, a Azion irá criar um novo certificado com base no conjunto de CNAMEs modificados, e a entrada antiga será desativada.\n\n#### Status\n\nSe algum dos CNAMEs falhar no [desafio DNS-01](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/como-gerar-um-certificado-lets-encrypt/#opção-2-preparar-a-entrada-de-dns-com-um-provedor-de-dns-externo), o certificado não será gerado e permanecerá com o status *Pending*.\n\n#### Uso de wildcard\n\nVocê pode usar CNAMEs *wildcard* (`*.dominio.com`) ou misturar CNAMEs *wildcard* e *não wildcard* no mesmo Domain. Quando você usa a notação *wildcard*, você não precisa especificar subdomínios que já estão abarcados na *wildcard*. Por exemplo, se você decidir que o certificado deve ser aplicado a `*.dominio.com`, você não precisa incluir `blog.domain.com` na lista de CNAMEs do **Domain**.\n\nA resolução do nome do host segue as regras padrão da Azion: os domínios específicos têm precedência sobre os *wildcard*. Por exemplo, um certificado Let's Encrypt para o Domain `blog.dominio.com` terá precedência sobre um certificado para o Domain `*.dominio.com`.\n\n---\n\n## Certificate Signing Request\n\nUm Certificate Signing Request (CSR) é um dos primeiros passos para obter seu próprio certificado TLS. Para clientes com suporte ao FIPS 140 contratado, a chave privada será armazenada em um HSM que utiliza módulo criptográfico certificado no standard FIPS-140 Level 3.\n\n---\n\n## Marca registrada\n\n[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) é uma marca registrada pela [Internet Security Research Group](https://www.abetterinternet.org/).

O domínio Azion terá o formato `xxxx.preview.azionedge.net`.\n\nPara ativar a seleção de ambiente, entre em contato com a [equipe de Vendas] (https://www.azion.com/pt-br/contate-vendas/).\n\n---\n\n## CNAME\n\nÉ o serviço padrão responsável pela criação das configurações de CNAME, tornando possível substituir domínios dentro da Azion. Cada domínio pode acomodar até 50 CNAMEs.\n\nVocê pode restringir o acesso à sua aplicação a partir do Azion domain ao ativar **CNAME Access Only**.\n\n---\n\n## Digital Certificates\n\nPara utilizar seu domínio em HTTPS, você precisará de um certificado TLS (X.509). Você pode, sem custos adicionais, incluir seus certificados TLS no [Real-Time Manager](http://manager.azion.com) ou gerar um certificado *Let's Encrypt*™ que será gerenciado automaticamente pela Azion.\n\n[Saiba mais sobre Digital Certificates](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/digital-certificates/).\n\n---\n\n## Suporte para Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS)\n\nDomínios Azion também possuem **Suporte para Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS)**, um método de autenticação de usuários e visitantes, que valida o certificado digital de ambos os lados de uma requisição, tanto do lado do cliente como do lado do *Edge* (servidor). Adicionar suporte a mTLS na sua **Edge Application** garante um *handshake TLS* mais seguro, além de ser um requisito do *Open Banking*.\n\n> **Dica**: você pode precisar do mTLS se sua Edge Application oferece serviços financeiros e pagamentos.\n\nEssa configuração precisa ser ativada com a [equipe de Vendas](https://www.azion.com/pt-br/contate-vendas/).\n\n[Saiba mais sobre mTLS](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/domains/mtls/).\n",

    "body": "\n**Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS)**, também conhecido como *Mutual Authentication*, é um método de autenticação que valida o certificado digital de ambos os lados de uma requisição, tanto do lado do cliente como do lado do Edge (servidor).\n\nCom o **mTLS** ativado, a Azion checa o certificado do navegador do usuário e o valida com o certificado **Trusted Certificate (Trusted CA)** da sua **Edge Application** no Edge.\n\n**mTLS** é opcional para aplicações que utilizam protocolos *TLS*. No entanto, ele promete um *handshake TLS* mais seguro, além de ser um requisito do *Open Banking*.\n\n> Você pode precisar do **mTLS** se sua Edge Application oferece serviços financeiros e pagamentos.\n\n## Pré-requisitos\n\nÉ necessário que sua **Edge Application** esteja operando com protocolo *Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)*. O [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com) permite configurar **mTLS** em aplicações rodando apenas com HTTP (sem a camada de criptografia TLS). No entanto, mTLS exige uma conexão HTTPS para funcionar.\n\nAs opções de protocolo estão disponíveis na página de configuração da sua **Edge Application** no **Real-Time Manager**.\n\n> **Nota:** o mTLS só estará disponível caso o serviço esteja ativado. Para ativar, entre em contato com nossa [Equipe de Vendas](https://www.azion.com/pt-br/contate-vendas/).\n\n## Certificado Digital com suporte para mTLS (Trusted CA)\n\nPara configurar o **mTLS** em sua **Edge Application**, você precisa de um *Digital Certificate* com suporte para **mTLS**, gerado por uma *Autoridade de certificação terceira*. Na Azion, chamamos esse certificado de **Trusted CA**.\n\nSelecione ou adicione um novo *Domain* e certifique-se de que a opção **mTLS** está ativada. Em seguida, selecione o **Trusted CA** adicionado anteriormente.\n\n> Os certificados gratuitos, gerados internamente pela Azion (Azion [SAN]), não têm suporte para mTLS.\n\nPara usar o modo *Enforce* do mTLS, é necessário utilizar a extensão para protocolos TLS, *Server Name Indication (SNI)*.\n\nAs conexões sem SNI são conectadas a uma configuração padrão que, no momento do *handshake TLS*, entrega o certificado Azion SAN.\n\nQuando temos requisições sem SNI para um Domain com mTLS no modo *Enforce*, a conexão é interrompida antes que a rota da sua Edge Application seja resolvida.\n\n> Certifique-se que suas Edge Applications sempre usem SNI nas solicitações.\n\n## Como funciona o mTLS na Azion \n\nA configuração padrão do **mTLS** bloqueia os acessos cuja identidade do usuário não puder ser verificada.\n\nSe sua aplicação precisa de necessidades de acesso especiais, é necessário configurar uma verificação permissiva (*Permissive mTLS*). A verificação permissiva pode ser configurada na página *Domains*.\n\nVocê também pode alterar e especificar as *header variables* do seu **mTLS** para atender aos requisitos do Open Banking. Isso pode ser feito na página de configuração do **Edge Application**, dentro do **RTM**.\n\n> A lista de variáveis aceitas está disponível na página [Rules Engine para Edge Application](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/rules-engine/).\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n**Edge Caching** é um módulo de **Edge Application** que reduz latência e permite uma alta taxa de transferência para suas aplicações por meio da rede mundial de edge nodes da Azion.\n\n---\n\n## Como funciona\n\nO **Edge Caching** é uma funcionalidade padrão disponibilizada para todas Edge Applications na Azion, garantindo performance e baixa latência. Ele é composto por uma arquitetura de proxy reverso, por meio da qual seus usuários se conectam nos Edge Nodes de nossa rede global altamente distribuída. O Edge Caching pode realizar *caching* de seu conteúdo e, além disso, ampliar sua versatilidade com o add-on **L2 Caching**.\n\nQuando um usuário requisita um conteúdo na internet, seu navegador ou aplicação inicia o processo pela resolução de DNS, a fim de traduzir o domínio solicitado para um endereço IP. Ao utilizar a Azion, você aponta o DNS de sua aplicação web para um endereço gerado ao criar um Domain na Azion.\n\nA Azion seleciona o Edge Node mais próximo do usuário utilizando o seu **Software-Defined Networking (SDN) Router**, reduzindo latência e aumentando a velocidade da transferência do conteúdo.\n\n---\n\n## Cache Settings\n\nEste serviço é responsável por criar configurações de cache, contendo diversas funcionalidades que ampliam a forma como o conteúdo é entregue.\n\nO **Cache Settings** trabalha com duas versões:\n\n1. A primeira versão foca em conteúdos estáticos, ou seja, não é necessário que você tenha o serviço de **Application Acceleration** habilitado.\n2. A segunda versão, que emprega o módulo **Edge Caching**, estende inúmeras opções de configuração na interface de Cache Settings.\n\n> Consulte o guia sobre [Como configurar políticas de cache para o Edge Application](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/edge-caching/) para personalizar suas políticas de cache.\n\n### Browser Cache Settings \n\nO **Browser Cache Settings** determina a quantidade de tempo que o conteúdo fica em cache no navegador de internet. É possível configurar a **Edge Application** para:\n\n| Honor Origin Cache Headers                    | Override Cache Settings                       |\n| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |\n| Este recurso respeita as definições de cache enviadas por seus servidores de origem por meio de cabeçalhos HTTP (Cache-Control and Expires), enviando os mesmos cabeçalhos para o navegador web. | É a funcionalidade que sobrescreve o cache do servidor de origem, configurando o *time-to-live* (TTL) manualmente. |\n\n### CDN Cache Settings \n\n**CDN Cache Settings** é a quantidade de tempo que as Edge Applications da Azion realizam *cache* do conteúdo. É possível configurar a **Edge Application** para:\n\n| Honor Origin Cache Headers                                   | Override Cache Settings                                      |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Respeita as definições de cache enviadas por seus servidores de origem por meio de cabeçalhos HTTP (*Cache-Control and Expires*), enviando os mesmos cabeçalhos para o navegador web. | Sobrescreve o cache do servidor de origem configurando o TTL manualmente.<br /><br />Para alterar o TTL do cache na CDN para valores abaixo de 60 segundos, você deve habilitar o módulo [Application Acceleration](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/application-acceleration/). |\n\n> **Importante**: quando o TTL de CDN cache é menor do que 10 segundos, há uma possibilidade de que sua aplicação incorra cache misses. Isso acontece devido à uma lentidão de resposta dos servidores da origem, por exemplo, em períodos de manutenção. Nessas situações, a Azion recomenda que você aplique o comportamento [Bypass Cache](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/application-acceleration/#bypass-cache) em sua aplicação ou defina um valor de TTL maior do que 10 para acomodar a conexão entre a Azion e origens lentas.\n\n---\n\n## L2 Caching \n\n> Essa funcionalidade somente estará disponível caso o serviço esteja ativado. Para ativar **L2 Caching**, [contate nossa equipe de vendas](https://www.azion.com/pt-br/contate-vendas/).\n\n**L2 Caching** é uma camada adicional de cache entre a edge da Azion e sua origem que ajuda a reduzir ainda mais a carga na sua infraestrutura.\n\nAo acessar suas aplicações na Azion, seu usuário acessa nossa rede altamente distribuída e capaz de realizar edge caching. Ao ativar o L2 Caching em suas edge applications, você passa a contar com uma segunda camada de cache que será responsável por alimentar o edge, mantendo o seu conteúdo em cache pelo tempo que você determinar.\n\nAo utilizar o L2 Caching como uma camada adicional de cache, é necessário incluir uma configuração por região, por exemplo: `sa-brazil` para o Brasil, `na-united-states` para os EUA etc, dependo da região.\n\nO L2 Caching foi desenhado especialmente para objetos que podem permanecer um longo período de tempo em cache. Assim, você só poderá ativá-lo em políticas de cache com TTL igual ou superior a *3 segundos*, sendo por padrão o TTL de *60 segundos*.\n\nO módulo L2 Caching atualmente não suporta ignorar o cache. Você pode [configurar uma regra de Bypass Cache](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/edge-caching/#bypass-cache) para cache na Azion, mas aplicações com configuração de cache na L2 ativada continuarão a manter cache nessa camada pelo TTL especificado.\n\nSempre que necessário, você pode utilizar o **Real-Time Purge** para expirar seu conteúdo do L2 Caching antes do tempo previsto de TTL. Lembre-se de purgar primeiro no L2 e somente depois no **Edge Caching**. Isso evita a realimentação do edge com conteúdo desatualizado do L2.\n\n> **Atenção**: não é possível utilizar a configuração **Honor Origin** para CDN Cache. É necessário colocar um TTL para sobrescrever o CDN cache.\n\n---\n\n## Slice Settings \n\n**Slice** é uma funcionalidade para Edge Applications que processa grandes quantidades de dados de forma mais efetiva, reduzindo a latência e economizando largura de banda.\n\nAo habilitar essa funcionalidade, arquivos grandes são fragmentados em pedaços menores. Esses fragmentos são entregues gradativamente ao usuário final de acordo com o consumo de dados, evitando uma transferência abrupta de dados que poderia ser interrompida pelo usuário. A funcionalidade Slice armazena dados sob demanda no momento em que o usuário os solicita, iniciando a operação de cache.\n\n> **Nota**: ao ativar a funcionalidade Slice, o *cache key* atual será ignorado e um novo será formado.\n\nEssa funcionalidade trabalha com um *slice-range* padrão de *1024kB*. Caso você deseje modificar o *slice-range*, [contate nossa equipe de vendas](https://www.azion.com/pt-br/contate-vendas/).\n\nSlice pode ser aplicada tanto à camada edge caching quanto a L2, dado que o módulo **L2 Caching** seja ativado.\n\n---\n\n## Cache de métodos HTTP\nPor padrão, a Azion armazena em cache apenas as solicitações GET e HEAD. Para habilitar o método OPTIONS, você deve ativar a botão de **Cache Options** dentro das configurações de sua **Edge Application** no **Real-Time Manager (RTM)**.\n\nO cache HTTP armazena uma resposta vinculada à uma solicitação e a reutiliza para solicitações subsequentes.\n\nVocê pode ativar a chave **Enable caching for POST**, permitindo que a Azion armazene em cache as solicitações POST; a chave **Enable caching for OPTIONS** permite que a Azion armazene em cache as solicitações de OPTIONS. Essa duas opções de cache implicam no uso do corpo da solicitação como parte da *cache key*.\n\n> Para habilitar o recurso **Cache OPTIONS** ou **Cache POST**, você deve ter o produto [Application Acceleration](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/application-acceleration/) ativado.\n\n---\n\n## Stale Cache\n\nQuando o cache da sua aplicação passa da data de expiração, ele se torna *stale* (obsoleto) e o servidor busca na origem a versão mais atualizada. Essa nova versão, com data de expiração atualizada, sobrescreve a antiga (*stale*).\n\nNo entanto, o servidor pode encontrar problemas e não conseguir buscar a versão mais atualizada da sua aplicação na origem. Nesses casos, ele entrega a última versão dela, mesmo expirada. Esse comportamento é conhecido como **Stale Cache**.\n\nStale Cache é uma configuração padrão do módulo **Edge Caching**. No entanto, se sua **Edge Application** precisar, é possível desativá-la.\n\n> **Atenção**: é importante lembrar que ao desativar o Stale Cache, caso o servidor não consiga atualizar o cache na origem, ele retornará um erro ao usuário, interrompendo a sessão.\n\n---\n\n## Advanced Cache Key\n\nVocê pode utilizar a Azion para entregar seu conteúdo dinâmico ou estático. Mesmo a parte dinâmica de um site muitas vezes pode ser cacheada para um perfil de usuários, agrupado de acordo com as necessidades específicas de sua aplicação, como cidade, perfil de navegação ou perfil de compras.\n\nConsulte a documentação da [Advanced Cache Key](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/application-acceleration/#advanced-cache-key) no módulo **Application Acceleration** para saber mais sobre essa configuração.\n\n---\n\n## Adaptive Delivery \n\nA funcionalidade **Adaptive Delivery** detecta grupos de dispositivos que você cria usando a funcionalidade [Device Groups](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/device-groups/), permitindo que você configure como o a Azion deve armazenar o seu conteúdo em cache.\n\n- **Content does not vary by Device Groups (Improves Caching)**: escolha essa opção para entregar a mesma versão do conteúdo, independentemente da detecção do dispositivo.\n\n- **Content varies by some Device Groups (Allowed rules)**: escolha essa opção para que a Azion mantenha variações baseadas em dispositivos de seus objetos no cache.\n",

    "body": "\nAs **Edge Functions** permitem que você crie aplicações serverless orientadas a eventos no edge da rede, mais perto dos usuários.\n\nCom Edge Functions, você pode executar funções serverless em resposta a eventos em edge nodes de nossa rede distribuída sem ter que provisionar ou gerenciar servidores.\n\n## Sobre Edge Functions\n\nAqui estão algumas das soluções fornecidas pelo Edge Functions.\n\nVocê pode usar functions para manipular HTTP nas seguintes fases de Request e HTTP Response:\n\n- Assim que a requisição de um usuário for recebida no Edge Node (Viewer Request).\n- Antes que o Edge Node da Azion encaminhe a requisição à Origin (Origin Request).\n- Assim que o Edge Node receber a resposta da Origin (Origin Response).\n- Antes que o Edge Node da Azion encaminhe a resposta para o usuário (Viewer Response).\n\nVocê também pode gerar *responses* sem necessariamente ter que encaminhar a requisição para a origem.\n\nCom o uso de Edge Functions na plataforma de Edge Computing da Azion, você poderá criar uma variedade de soluções, por exemplo:\n\n- Inspecionar *cookies* para *rewrite* de URLs para diferentes versões de seu site em experimentos A/B Test.\n- Enviar objetos diferentes para seus usuários com base em User-Agent header, que contém informação sobre o device que enviou a Request. Por exemplo, você pode enviar imagens em diferentes resoluções com base no dispositivo dos usuários.\n- Inspecionar Headers e Authorized Tokens, inserindo o Header e permitindo o Access Control antes de encaminhar a *request* à origem.\n- Adicionar, remover ou modificar cabeçalhos e *rewrite* de path direcionando usuários para diferentes objetos em cache.\n- Gerar HTTP *responses* para tarefas, como redirecionar usuários não autenticados para páginas de login, ou criar e entregar webpages estáticas geradas diretamente no edge.\n\nVeja mais formas de uso de Edge Functions em [Guias](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/).\n\n---\n\n## Como funciona?\n\nCrie suas próprias funções personalizadas ou utilize alguma das já existentes disponibilizadas pela Azion, tanto para **Edge Application** quanto para **Edge Firewall**. A linguagem suportada atualmente pela plataforma é **JavaScript**.\n\n**Edge Functions** executam o tratamento/atendimento da requisição. A plataforma de Edge provê um modelo de **Rules Engine** que pode ser usado para vincular a execução do código das Edge Functions de acordo com as fases de tratamento.\n\nO runtime específico de cada linguagem provê uma interface de programação para interagir e manipular os objetos de *request* e *response* para implementar a lógica necessária.\n\nAo instanciar uma **Edge Function**, você pode informar parâmetros que serão passados para a função, em formato [JSON](https://www.json.org/), por meio de argumentos, podendo ainda definir e executar testes on-line para validar sua construção.\n\nEdge Functions são executadas diretamente na infraestrutura de Edge da Azion. Para utilizá-las, basta que estejam associadas a um *Behavior* no Rules Engine. Assim, quando uma requisição satisfizer os critérios definidos nas regras da Rules Engine, o *trigger* para execução da Edge Function será disparado.\n\n---\n\n## Base\n\nVocê pode criar **Edge Functions** e manter um repositório de funções que podem ser usadas tanto em **Edge Application** quanto em **Edge Firewall**. Consulte a [Runtime API](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/edge-functions/runtime-apis/javascript/) de acordo com o Runtime escolhido para escrever a Edge Function.\n\nAlém de personalizar suas próprias funções, você também pode escolher entre as prontas para uso fornecidas pela Azion ou por Independent Software Vendors (ISV). Navegue pelo catálogo do **Azion Marketplace** no **Real-Time Manager (RTM)**.\n\n### Criar Edge Functions\n\nUtilize a [Runtime API](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/edge-functions/runtime-apis/javascript/) da linguagem de sua preferência para escrever Edge Functions.\n\n### Runtime Environment JavaScript\n\nAo criar Edge Functions usando o *Runtime Environment* JavaScript, as Edge Functions escritas pelo próprio usuário entram direto em produção sem passar por uma revisão interna, uma vez que o código é executado isoladamente e limitado a recursos isolados.\n\nVocê pode modificar o comportamento de uma função sem alterar o próprio código. Isso significa que você não precisa codificar a função. Na aba Args (Argumentos), você pode inserir parâmetros `JSON` por funções de código interno. Esse formato permite designar alternativas de variáveis para seu código que podem conter detalhes sobre uma função e requisição.\n\n*Args* são valores dinâmicos que podem mudar as Edge Functions em execução nos edge nodes.\n\nVocê pode usar a mesma função em diferentes **Edge Applications**.\n\nPor exemplo, se você criar uma **Edge Function** com um argumento que controla se o código precisa enviar dados para S3, e em uma determinada edge application você determinar `true`, na *Functions Instance*, nos *Arg*, a função irá gerar uma postagem para um S3 para que os resultados da requisição sejam mantidos.\n\n- **Estrutura**: Os argumentos são sempre estruturas `JSON` que serão armazenadas em uma configuração de função por meio da aba *Args* no módulo *Functions*.\n- **Instanciar**: Para instanciar *Args*, use `event.args.<ARG_CREATED>`. Ao usar este comando, você poderá se conectar à guia *Args* ao seu código.\n\nConfira nossa [página de exemplos](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/edge-functions/javascript-examples/utilizar-args/).\n\n### Instanciar Edge Functions\n\nAntes de associar um trigger de execução à Edge Function, ela deve ser instanciada, de acordo com o seu initiator type, em Edge Application ou Edge Firewall. Para isso, o módulo Edge Functions deve estar habilitado. Então, por meio da aba **Functions**, você poderá instanciar suas **Edge Functions** para posterior uso em uma *Rule* do **Rules Engine**.\n\nPara saber mais sobre *Edge Functions Instances*, acesse a documentação de [Edge Application](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/edge-functions-instances/) e [Edge Firewall](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-firewall/edge-functions-instances/).\n\n### Métricas para Edge Functions\n\nPor meio do **RTM**, fornecemos informações em tempo real sobre o desempenho das suas Edge Functions.\n\nPara acessar os gráficos, siga as seguintes etapas:\n\n1. Acesse o [RTM](https://manager.azion.com/) e selecione **Real-Time Metrics** na seção **OBSERVE**. Em seguida, clique em Edge Functions.\n2. Visualize informações – por exemplo, a quantidade de invocações por instância de Edge Function.\n\nLeia mais sobre o [Real-Time Metrics](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/real-time-metrics/).\n\n---\n\n## Passo a passo para criar uma Edge Function\n\nVocê está a um passo de criar e executar funções serverless em *Edge Nodes* a partir da poderosa rede distribuída da Azion.\n\nPara que sua **Edge Function** entre efetivamente em produção, basta escrever, instanciar e associar a um Behavior *Run Function*, em uma Rule no **Rules Engine**.\n\n1. Acesse o [RTM](https://manager.azion.com/). No menu Edge Computing, clique em **Edge Functions**.\n2. Adicione uma nova Edge Function clicando no botão **Add Function**.\n3. Dê um nome à sua função no campo **Edge Function Name** para poder salvar suas configurações.\n4. Em *Language*, selecione **JavaScript**. Copie o seguinte exemplo para o campo da aba *Code*.\n\n```js\n       async function handleRequest(request) {\n        return new Response(\"Hello World!\",\n          {\n              status:200\n          })\n       }\n       addEventListener(\"fetch\", event => {\n        event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))\n       })\n```\n\n\n\n1. No campo *Function to run*, digite o nome da função principal a ser executada no código fonte.\n\n2. Selecione o *Initiator Type*, que se refere ao tipo de módulo onde a função será instanciada e executada. Neste exemplo, refere-se à **Edge Application**.\n\n3. Clique em **Save** para salvar suas configurações. Você retorna à página inicial das Edge Functions, onde você visualiza sua lista de Edge Functions.\n\n4. Em seguida, acesse o menu **Products**, no canto superior esquerdo. Selecione uma Edge Application de sua lista.\n\n5. Na aba **Main Settings**, ative o módulo Edge Functions na seção **Edge Application Modules**.\n\n6. Na aba **Rules Engine**, crie ou edite uma regra e na seção *Behavior*, no campo *Then*, selecione **Run Function** e a associe à Edge Function desejada.\n\n7. Exemplo de resposta ao executar o Behavior *Run Function*\\:\n\n   `Hello World!`\n\n\n\n1. Use o **RTM** para verificar suas métricas. Por exemplo, quando você deseja ver o número de invocações de instâncias do Edge Functions.\n\n> Os campos marcados com um asterisco são obrigatórios.\n\n---\n\n## Edge Functions com múltiplos arquivos\n\nO Azion **Edge Functions** trabalha com um único arquivo JavaScript (.js). Caso suas Edge Functions tenham mais de um arquivo ou utilizem módulos JavaScript, você precisará agrupar esses arquivos. Uma das maneiras de proceder é usar o [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), que permite agrupar arquivos JavaScript em um único arquivo.\n\n> Somente arquivos JavaScript são suportados.\n\n> Não há suporte para Node/Deno API nativamente. Seu código deve resolver todas as dependências.\n\n[Conheça mais sobre a Runtime API da Azion](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/edge-functions/runtime-apis/javascript/).\n\nExemplo:\n\nSe você tiver uma **Edge Function** que tenha um módulo para buscar dados:\n\n- O `index.js` tem o método `eventListener` e os módulos de importação.\n- a pasta de módulos tem todos os módulos que são necessários por sua função;\n- o `webpack.config.js` tem a configuração de como empacotar sua função.\n\n### Requisitos\n\n- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org).\n- [webpack-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-cli).\n\n### Agrupamento e Upload\n\nDepois de codificar sua função, você precisa agrupá-la usando o seguinte comando:\n\n`webpack-cli --config webpack.config.js`\n\nIsto vai gerar um diretório chamado `dist` com um único arquivo chamado `main.js`. Você precisa copiar o conteúdo desse arquivo e colá-lo no [RTM](https://manager.azion.com).\n\n- Estrutura do arquivo:\n\n```\nyour_function/\n  \tmodules/\n  \t\tdata.js\n  \tindex.js\n  \twebpack.config.js\n```\n\n- Conteúdo:\n\n`index.js`\\:\n\n```js\nimport fetchData from \"./modules/data\"\n\naddEventListener(\"fetch\", (event) => {\n   event.respondWith(fetchData())\n})\n```\n\n- `modules/data.js`\\:\n\n```js\nasync function fetchData() {\n   let data = await fetch(\"https://httpbin.org/get?username=azionuser&name=Azion&last_login=2021-03-10\")\n   let json = await data.json()\n   return new Response(JSON.stringify(json[\"args\"]), {\"status\": 200})\n}\n\nexport default fetchData\n```\n\n- `webpack.config.js`\\:\n\nO destino deve ser \"webworker\" e o modo deve ser \"production\".\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n target: \"webworker\",\n entry: \"./index.js\",\n mode: \"production\",\n}\n```\n\n- Arquivo gerado:\n\n`dist/main.js`\n\n```js\n(()=>{\"use strict\";addEventListener(\"fetch\",(t=>{t.respondWith(async function(){let t=await fetch(\"https://httpbin.org/get?username=azionuser&name=Azion&last_login=2021-03-10\"),e=await t.json();return new Response(JSON.stringify(e.args),{status:200})}())}))})();\n```\n\n---\n\n## 6. Ativar suas configurações\n\nVocê encontrará os seguintes botões na parte inferior da tela:\n\n- **Active**\\: esta opção habilita ou desabilita suas configurações no sistema.\n- **Cancel**\\: com esta opção, você retorna à página inicial de **Edge Functions** e descarta suas edições.\n- **Save**\\: quando suas seleções estiverem concluídas, clique em **Save** para salvar suas configurações.\n\nAo salvar suas configurações, você retorna à página inicial do Edge Functions, onde vê sua lista de Edge Functions classificada por estas opções:\n\n- Name\n- Language\n- Initiator type\n- Last editor\n- Last modified\n- Ref\n- Count\n- Active\n\nAo clicar nas setas dessas abas, você também pode alterar a forma como sua lista é exibida.\n\n",

    "body": "\n**Error Responses** é uma capacidade do Azion **Edge Application** que permite personalizar páginas de erro para os usuários com base no código de status recebido da origem.\n\n---\n\n## Como funciona\n\nQuando um usuário solicita conteúdo de uma edge application, a Azion envia a solicitação para os servidores de origem. Como resposta, a origem envia de volta um código de status HTTP, o qual indica se a solicitação foi ou não concluída.\n\nOs códigos de status HTTP são números de três dígitos, agrupados em cinco categorias:\n\n- Respostas de informação (1xx): o status da conexão ou o progresso antes da requisição ser completada.\n- Respostas de sucesso (2xx): a requisição foi recebida, compreendida, aceita e processada com sucesso pela origem.\n- Mensagens de redirecionamento (3xx): para atender à requisição, deve haver um redirecionamento.\n- Respostas de erro do cliente (4xx): a requisição não pôde ser completada devido a um possível erro do cliente.\n- Respostas de erro do servidor (5xx): o servidor não foi capaz de processar a requisição.\n\n> Para mais informações sobre status HTTP, consulte as [especificações de códigos de status HTTP](https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc9110.html#overview.of.status.codes).\n\nCom a funcionalidade **Error Responses**, você pode personalizar como sua aplicação irá lidar com erros de *Cliente (4xx)* e *Servidor (5xx)*. Desta forma, quando uma requisição é feita para uma URL que não está na origem ou quando não se obteve resposta do servidor, o usuário pode ser redirecionado para uma página de erro personalizada, cujo conteúdo pode ser armazenado em cache.\n\n> Consulte [Como personalizar uma página de resposta de erro](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/personalizar-pagina-resposta-erro/) para um guia sobre essa funcionalidade.\n\n| Campo | Descrição |\n| --- | --- |\n| Status Code | Código que a Azion recebe quando se conecta à origem. |\n| Error Caching TTL | Define o tempo em segundos que a página de erro ficará em cache antes de ser atualizada.<br /><br />Como geralmente páginas de erro são estáticas e não mudam com frequência, a Azion recomenda valores altos de cache. Dessa maneira, você pode otimizar a performance da sua aplicação, bem como o custo de processamento na origem. |\n| URI | Caminho do arquivo com o conteúdo da página de erro que será entregue. Exemplo: `/404.html` |\n| Custom Status Code | Código de status que será entregue ao usuário no lugar do original. Exemplo: `404` |\n| Set Origin | A origem em que o arquivo da URI está localizado. |\n\n---\n\n## Códigos de erro disponíveis\n\n| Código de status | Descrição |\n| --- | --- |\n| 400: Bad Request | Erro na requisição, tais como parâmetros inválidos, ausência de parâmetros obrigatórios ou outros. |\n| 401: Unauthorized | Erro resultante da ausência do cabeçalho HTTP `Authentication`. |\n| 403: Forbidden | Falta de permissão do usuário para executar a operação solicitada. |\n| 404: Not Found | O recurso solicitado não existe. |\n| 405: Method Not Allowed | O método solicitado não é aplicável à URL. |\n| 406: Not Acceptable | Ausência do cabeçalho `Accept` na requisição HTTP ou cabeçalho contendo formato ou versão não suportados pela API. |\n| 408: Request Timeout | Esta resposta é enviada por alguns servidores em uma conexão ociosa, mesmo sem qualquer requisição prévia pelo cliente. Ela significa que o servidor gostaria de derrubar esta conexão em desuso.<br /><br />Esta resposta é muito usada já que alguns navegadores, como Chrome, Firefox 27+, ou IE9 usam mecanismos HTTP de pré-conexão para acelerar a navegação. Note também que alguns servidores derrubam a conexão sem enviar esta mensagem. |\n| 409: Conflict | Conflito na execução da requisição, como a solicitação de criação de um registro já existente. |\n| 410: Gone | Esta resposta será enviada quando o conteúdo requisitado foi permanentemente deletado do servidor, sem nenhum endereço de redirecionamento. É esperado que clientes removam seus caches e links para o recurso.<br /><br />A especificação HTTP espera que este código de status seja usado para \"serviços promocionais de tempo limitado\". APIs não devem se sentir obrigadas a indicar que recursos foram removidos com este código de status. |\n| 411: Length Required | O servidor rejeitou a requisição porque o campo `Content-Length` do cabeçalho não está definido e o servidor o requer. |\n| 414: URI Too Long | A URI requisitada pelo cliente é maior do que o servidor aceita para interpretar. |\n| 415: Unsupported Media Type | O formato de mídia dos dados requisitados não é suportado pelo servidor, então o servidor rejeita a requisição. |\n| 416: Request Range Not Satisfiable | O trecho especificado pelo campo `Range` do cabeçalho na requisição não pode ser preenchido; é possível que o trecho esteja fora do tamanho dos dados da URI alvo. |\n| 426: Upgrade Required | O servidor se recusa a executar a requisição usando o protocolo corrente mas estará pronto a fazê-lo após o cliente atualizar para um protocolo diferente. O servidor envia um cabeçalho Upgrade numa resposta 426 para indicar o(s) protocolo(s) requeridos. |\n| 429: Too Many Requests | A requisição foi rejeitada temporariamente por exceder o limite de operações. Aguarde até o momento definido no cabeçalho `X-Ratelimit-Reset` e tente novamente. |\n| 431: Request Header Fields Too Large | O cabeçalho da requisição é muito longo ou muitos cookies foram enviados na requisição. |\n| 500: Internal Server Error | Erro não intencional, por falha não identificada no processamento da requisição. |\n| 501: Not Implemented | O método da requisição não é suportado pelo servidor e não pode ser manipulado. Os únicos métodos exigidos que servidores suportem (e portanto não devem retornar este código) são GET e HEAD. |\n| 502: Bad Gateway | Esta resposta de erro significa que o servidor, ao trabalhar como um gateway a fim de obter uma resposta necessária para manipular a requisição, obteve uma resposta inválida. |\n| 503: Service Unavailable | O servidor não está pronto para manipular a requisição. Causas comuns são um servidor em manutenção ou sobrecarregado. É uma boa prática enviar, junto dessa resposta, uma página explicativa sobre o problema.<br /><br />Estas respostas devem ser usadas para condições temporárias e o cabeçalho `Retry-After` deverá, se possível, conter o tempo estimado para recuperação do serviço. O webmaster deve também tomar cuidado com os cabeçalhos relacionados com o cache que são enviados com esta resposta, já que estas respostas de condições temporárias normalmente não deveriam ser postas em cache. |\n| 504: Gateway Timeout | Esta resposta de erro é dada quando o servidor está atuando como um gateway e não obtém uma resposta a tempo. |\n| 505: HTTP Version Not Supported | A versão HTTP usada na requisição não é suportada pelo servidor. |\n\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n**Image Processor** é um módulo para **Edge Application** que aplica filtros em suas imagens e reduz o tamanho das mesmas, sem perda perceptível de qualidade visual. Com Image Processor, você consegue reduzir o tempo de transferência de seu conteúdo e aumenta a velocidade de navegação para seus usuários em suas aplicações.\n\n---\n\n## Instruções de uso \n\nEsse módulo oferece suporte aos seguintes formatos de imagem:\n\n- JPEG\n- GIF\n- PNG\n- BMP\n- ICO\n- WEBP (para [navegadores compatíveis](https://caniuse.com/%23search=webp))\n\n**Para configurar esse módulo, siga os passos:**\n\n1. Acesse o [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/).\n2. No canto superior esquerdo da página, acesse o **Products menu** > **Edge Application**.\n3. Selecione a **Edge Application** responsável pela distribuição de suas imagens da sua lista de aplicações ou [crie uma nova aplicação](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/ponto-de-partida/).\n4. Na aba **Main Settings**, habilite o módulo **Image Processor**.\n5. Na aba **Cache Settings**, adicione ou edite uma política de cache customizada para suas imagens.\n6. Na seção **Expiration Settings**, configure a política de expiração de suas imagens no [Edge Caching](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/edge-caching/).\n\n    > **Dica**: para imagens, a Azion recomenda que você utilize tempos mais longos como **Maximum TTL** para **CDN Cache**, como, por exemplo, 7.776.000 segundos (3 meses).\n\n7. Na seçao **Advanced Cache Key**, selecione uma das opções:\n\n   - **Content varies by some Query String fields (Allowlist)**: se você desejar listar todos os campos da Query String que diferenciam suas imagens. O **Image Processor** utiliza o campo *ims*, que deverá ser incluído na listagem com os demais campos necessários por sua aplicação de gestão de imagens. Essa opção requer que o módulo [Application Acceleration](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/application-acceleration/) esteja ativado.\n   - **Content varies by Query String, except for some fields (Blocklist)**: se você desejar listar apenas quais campos da Query String devem ser ignorados ao diferenciar os objetos em cache. Nesse caso, garanta que o campo *ims* seja removido da listagem. Essa opção requer o módulo [Application Acceleration](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/application-acceleration/) esteja ativado.\n   - **Content varies by all Query String fields**: se você não sabe ou não se sente seguro para listar os campos da Query String que são responsáveis pela variação do seu conteúdo em cache ou se não possui o produto **Application Acceleration**.\n\n8. Altere as demais seções e clique no botão **Save** para salvar a sua configuração de cache.\n9. Na aba **Rules Engine** do **Edge Application**, adicione ou edite uma regra customizada para um ou mais paths de imagens.\n10. No campo **Path**, digite o caminho para suas imagens ou use a expressão regular recomendada pela Azion:\n\n    > Caso você selecione o parâmetro `${request_uri}`, utilize a regex abaixo:**\n\n    ```\n    \\.(jpg|jpeg|gif|bmp|png)\n    ```\n\n    > Caso você selecione o parâmetro `${uri}`, utilize a regex abaixo:**\n\n    ```\n    \\.(jpg|jpeg|gif|bmp|png)$\n    ```\n\n11. Se você estiver utilizando expressão regular no campo **Path**, utilize o operador lógico **Matches**.\n11. No campo **Behavior** > **Set Cache Settings**, selecione o preset criado.\n12. No campo **Behavior**, selecione **Optimize Images**.\n13. Clique no botão **Save** para salvar a sua regra.\n\nA partir de agora, as imagens do *path* configurado serão automaticamente processadas. Além disso, o **Image Processor** detecta a compatibilidade do navegador com o formato WEBP e, quando possível, irá converter o formato da imagem automaticamente, trazendo ainda mais ganhos para você. Imagens BMP também serão automaticamente convertidas para JPEG ou WEBP, dependendo da compatibilidade do navegador.\n\nAcompanhe por meio do [Real-Time Metrics](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/real-time-metrics/) o gráfico de *Bandwidth Saving* para monitorar a economia de tráfego resultante do processamento de imagens.\n\n---\n\n## Redimensionar a imagem com auto-crop\n\nA partir de uma imagem original de seu acervo, o **Image Processor** poderá criar imagens derivadas, sob demanda, do tamanho que melhor se adapte à sua página.\n\nVocê especifica as dimensões desejadas como argumentos na Query String no formato:\n\n```\nims=WidthxHeight\n```\n\nOs parâmetros `Width` e `Height` devem ser alterados para a largura e altura da imagem, respectivamente, em pixels.\n\nPara redimensionar a imagem preservando o *aspect ratio*, exclua um dos dois valores, o qual será calculado automaticamente. Utilize `Widthx` para especificar apenas a largura e deixar que a altura seja calculada proporcionalmente ou `xHeight` para especificar apenas a altura e deixar que a largura seja calculada automaticamente.\n\nVocê também pode especificar ambas as dimensões, `Width` e `Height`, para recortar - *auto-crop* - a imagem nas dimensões desejadas. O recorte é centralizado e pode ocorrer tanto na vertical quanto na horizontal, dependendo do melhor encaixe das dimensões originais nas dimensões especificadas.\n\nUtilize o valor `orig` em qualquer das dimensões da imagem se desejar manter a dimensão original.\n\n**Exemplos:**\n\n`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=880x`\n(880 pixels de largura, altura automática)\n\n[![Image_Processor_1](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=880x)](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=880x)\n\n`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=880xorig`\n(880 pixels de largura, altura original)\n\n[![Image_Processor_2](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_2.png)](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_2.png)\n\n`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=400x`\n(400 pixels de largura, altura automática)\n\n[![Image_Processor_1](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=400x)](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_2.png?ims=400x)\n\n`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=400x400`\n(400 pixels de largura, 400 pixels de altura)\n\n[![Image_Processor_1](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=400x400)](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=400x400)\n\n`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=x100`\n(largura automática, 100 pixels de altura)\n\n[![Image_Processor_1](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=x100)](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=x100)\n\n---\n\n## Redimensionar a imagem com fit-in\n\nOutra forma de redimensionar a imagem é utilizando *fit-in*:\n\n```\nims=fit-in/WidthxHeight\n```\n\nOs parâmetros `Width` e `Height` devem ser alterados para a largura e altura da imagem, respectivamente, em pixels.\n\nA imagem derivada será redimensionada para caber na área especificada por WidthxHeight. O aspect ratio da imagem original é preservado e, se desejar, você pode ocultar um dos valores.\n\nCaso a área especificada seja maior do que as dimensões da imagem, a imagem não será aumentada. As dimensões especificadas como parâmetros do *fit-in* representam os limites de tamanho máximo da área que a imagem pode ocupar. Uma ou ambas as dimensões da imagem poderão ser menores do que a área delimitadora.\n\n**Exemplo:**\n\n`https://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=fit-in/400x400`\n(largura máxima de 400 pixels e altura máxima de 400 pixels)\n\n[![Image_Processor_1](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=fit-in/400x400)](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=fit-in/400x400)\n\n---\n\n## Recortar a imagem\n\nO recorte da imagem pode ser feito informando um ponto inicial (AxB) e um ponto final (CxD) como argumento na Query String da URL da imagem:\n\n```\nims=AxB:CxD\n```\n\n- `AxB` é o ponto inicial do recorte indicando a posição, em pixels, do canto superior esquerdo da área a ser recortada.\n- `CxD` é o ponto final do recorte indicando a posição, em pixels, do canto inferior direito da área a ser recortada.\n\n**Exemplo:**\n\n`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=430x20:910x730`\n(coordenada inicial de 430x20 pixels e coordenada final 910x730 pixels)\n\n[![Image_Processor_7](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_7.png)](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_7.png)\n\n---\n\n## Alterar qualidade da imagem\n\nO **Image Processor** otimiza suas imagens, reduzindo o tamanho do arquivo e, portanto, o tempo de transferência do mesmo. O valor default de qualidade utilizado é de 85%, o que proporciona otimização sem perda perceptível de qualidade visual.\n\nVocê pode definir uma qualidade customizada para suas imagens, utilizando o filtro:\n\n```\nfilters:quality(Number)\n```\n\n`Number` deve ser um número inteiro entre 0 e 100, que representa a qualidade desejada.\n\n**Exemplo:**\n\n`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=filters:quality(100)`\n(100% de qualidade)\n\n[![Image_Processor_1](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=filters:quality(100))](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=filters:quality(100))\n\n`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=filters:quality(85)`\n(85% de qualidade)\n\n[![Image_Processor_1](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=filters:quality(85))](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=filters:quality(85))\n\n`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=filters:quality(15)`\n(15% de qualidade)\n\n[![Image_Processor_1](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=filters:quality(15))](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=filters:quality(15))\n\n> Para confirmar que sua imagem está sendo otimizada, [inspecione a página](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools) pelo seu navegador e localize o caminho correspondente da imagem. Na *query string* da URL, o campo `ims=VALORxVALOR` corresponde à resolução que será carregada na página.\n\nO campo `ims` também permite que você altere a otimização, a qualidade e o tamanho conforme necessário. Para visualizar o arquivo original, basta remover a *query string* da URL.\n\n> **Nota**: Se for inserida uma resolução maior que a original, o IMS irá exibir a imagem com a maior resolução possível.\n\n---\n\n## Adicionar marca d’água na imagem\n\nPara adicionar marca d’água em imagens utilizando o **Image Processor**, utilize o filtro:\n\n```\nfilters:watermark(ImageURL,X,Y,Alpha)\n```\n\n- `ImageURL` é a URL da imagem que deve ser inserida como marca d’água. Caso a URL contenha parênteses, eles devem ser codificados como %28 para “(” e %29 para “)”.\n- `X` é a posição horizontal de inserção da marca d’água. Números positivos representam deslocamento, em pixels, da borda à esquerda para a direita, enquanto números negativos representam deslocamento da borda à direita para a esquerda. Pode ser utilizado o valor `center`, para centralizar horizontalmente a marca d’água, ou o valor `repeat`, para preencher horizontalmente a imagem com repetições da marca d’água.\n- `Y` é a posição vertical de inserção da marca d’água. Números positivos representam um deslocamento, em pixels, do topo para a base, enquanto números negativos representam deslocamento da base para o topo. Pode ser utilizado o valor `center`, para centralizar verticalmente a marca d’água, ou o valor `repeat`, para preencher verticalmente a imagem com repetições da marca d’água.\n- `Alpha` é a transparência da marca d’água. Deve ser um número entre 0 (completamente opaco) e 100 (completamente transparente).\n\n**Exemplo:**\n\n`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=filters:watermark(http://yourdomain.com/watermark-image.png,-25,-10,50)`\n\n---\n\n## Converter o formato de uma imagem\n\nVocê pode converter o formato de uma imagem utilizando o filtro:\n\n```\nfilters:format(ImageFormat)\n```\n\n`ImageFormat` pode assumir os valores `webp`, `jpeg`, `gif` ou `png`.\n\n**Exemplo:**\n\n`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=filters:format(gif)`\n(converte uma imagem JPEG para GIF)\n\n[![Image_Processor_1](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=filters:format(gif))](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=filters:format(gif))\n\n---\n\n## Preencher imagem\n\nO **Image Processor** também pode ser utilizado para gerar uma imagem derivada em um tamanho maior do que o da original mas, ao invés de redimensioná-la para o tamanho desejado, preenche o espaço com uma cor customizada. Utilize o [parâmetro de fit-in](#redimensionar-a-imagem-com-fit-in) com as dimensões desejadas associado com filtro *fill*:\n\n```\nfilters:fill(Color)\n```\n\n`Color` é a cor de preenchimento, seguindo a nomenclatura e códigos especificados para o [padrão HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors).\n\n**Exemplo:**\n\n`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=fit-in/400x400/filters:fill(gray)`\n\n[![Image_Processor_1](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=fit-in/400x400/filters:fill(gray))](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=fit-in/400x400/filters:fill(gray))\n\n`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=fit-in/400x400/filters:fill(008080)`\n\n[![Image_Processor_1](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=fit-in/400x400/filters:fill(008080))](/assets/docs/images/image-prsocessor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=fit-in/400x400/filters:fill(008080))\n\n`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=fit-in/400x400/filters:fill(00ffff)`\n\n[![Image_Processor_1](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=fit-in/400x400/filters:fill(00ffff))](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=fit-in/400x400/filters:fill(00ffff))\n\n---\n\n## Combinar filtros\n\nO **Image Processor** permite que você combine os filtros desejados separando os mesmos por `:`.\n\n```\nfilters:filter1(arg1):filter2(arg2)\n```\n\nfilter1(arg1) e filter2(arg2) são os filtros que você deseja aplicar.\n\n**Exemplo:**\n\n`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=fit-in/400x400/filters:fill(gray):quality(100)`\n\n",

Quando você cria uma aplicação pelo [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/) e aponta o tráfego do seu domínio para a Azion, seus usuários acessam sua aplicação através da nossa rede global distribuída de edge nodes.\n\n> Para mais informações sobre como apontar seu domínio para uma edge application, consulte a [documentação de Domains](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/domains/).\n\nEntão, a Azion seleciona qual edge node mais próximo do seu usuário pode processar a requisição, reduzindo latência e acelerando a transferência de conteúdo e downloads.\n\nNessa arquitetura, sua aplicação web ou o seu conteúdo precisa ser disponibilizado a partir de uma origem, que pode ser um ou mais servidores em sua infraestrutura, um serviço na nuvem ou um armazenamento em nuvem de sua preferência.\n\n> Para mais informações sobre como configurar uma ou múltiplas origens, consulte nossas documentações de [Single Origin](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/single-origin/) e [Load Balancer](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/load-balancer/).\n\n---\n\n## Edge Caching\n\nAtravés do Edge Caching, a rede global altamente distribuída da Azion permite que você entregue seu conteúdo com muito mais eficiência. O conteúdo que estiver em cache – *cache hit* – nos edge nodes da Azion pode ser entregue diretamente para seus usuários a partir do Edge Node mais próximo, sem necessidade de acessar sua origem. Além de aumentar o desempenho e escalabilidade para seu conteúdo, você poderá economizar em sua infraestrutura de origem.\n\nUm *cache miss* ocorre quando um conteúdo é solicitado e não está cacheado. A Azion minimiza o efeito do *cache miss* ao manter uma conexão *keep-alive* com sua origem sempre que possível, evitando o overhead do handshake TCP/IP. Independentemente do volume de requisições simultâneas realizadas aos Edge Nodes da Azion, cada Edge Node buscará o conteúdo em sua origem apenas uma vez por *cache miss*, o que reduz substancialmente o impacto em sua infraestrutura.\n\n---\n\n## Delivery\n\n### Protocolos de entrega\n\nVocê pode customizar a entrega de sua aplicação através das seguintes opções:\n\n- **HTTP**: entrega sua aplicação usando apenas o protocolo HTTP.\n- **HTTP & HTTPS**: entrega sua aplicação usando os protocolos HTTP e HTTPS.\n\n> Se você escolher entregar sua aplicação usando **HTTP & HTTPS**, você deve definir a **versão mínima de TLS** e configurar [Digital Certificates](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/digital-certificates/) para seu domínio.\n\n### Suporte a HTTP/3\n\n> Suporte a HTTP/3 está em *early access*. [Contate o time de Vendas](https://www.azion.com/pt-br/contate-vendas) para habilitar esta funcionalidade em sua conta.\n\nSe você escolher entregar sua aplicação através de **HTTP & HTTPS**, você pode habilitar o **HTTP/3 support**. Baseado no protocolo QUIC, HTTP/3 proporciona menores tempos de carregamento e latência quando comparados a versões anteriores.\n\nAo habilitar suporte a HTTP/3, suas edge applications podem utilizar essa versão do protocolo em navegadores compatíveis somente através da port *80 em HTTP* e porta *443 em HTTPS*, além da *versão mínima de TLS 1.3*.\n\nNa primeira requisição de um usuário a uma edge application com HTTP/3, o handshake e a primeira resposta serão conduzidos usando TCP e HTTP/1.1 ou HTTP/2. A resposta dessa troca atribui um valor ao [cabeçalho Alt-Svc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Alt-Svc) que indica que a versão mais recente do protocolo está disponível para o navegador. Se o navegador for compatível com HTTP/3, o protocolo QUIC e o HTTP/3 serão usados, a menos que a resposta em cache falhe ou expire.\n\n### Portas\n\nA Azion permite que você selecione quais portas HTTP e HTTPS serão usadas pela sua aplicação. Você deve selecionar *pelo menos uma porta* das portas disponíveis para cada protocolo escolhido, mas você pode selecionar dentre quaisquer portas disponíveis para entrega.\n\n> Se você habilitar **HTTP/3 support**, a configuração multiport será sobrescrita para as portas padrão: 80 em HTTP e 443 em HTTPS. Multiport simultâneo não está disponível para aplicações com suporte a HTTP/3.\n\n#### Lista de portas disponíveis\n\n| HTTP Port    | HTTPS Port    |\n|--------------|---------------|\n| 80 (default) | 443 (default) |\n| 8080         | 8443          |\n| 8008         | 9440          |\n|              | 9441          |\n|              | 9442          |\n|              | 9443          |\n\n---\n\n## Versão mínima de TLS\n\nO protocolo **Transport Layer Security (TLS)** permite que você criptografe o tráfego da web. As versões de TLS que podem ser usadas com edge applications são:\n\n- TLS 1.0 (*descontinuado*)\n- TLS 1.1 (*descontinuado*)\n- TLS 1.2\n- TLS 1.3\n\nVocê poderá escolher a versão mínima de TLS que será suportada para criptografar o tráfego de sua edge application. Ao escolher versões recentes do protocolo, dispositivos ou navegadores mais antigos podem não conseguir acessar a edge application.\n\n> Se você habilitar **HTTP/3 support**, a versão mínima de TLS será sobrescrita para TLS 1.3.\n\nPor padrão, a Azion bloqueia *TLS Renegotiation* e *TLS Resumption*. Se você deseja personalizar essa configuração, entre em contato com nossa [equipe de Vendas](https://www.azion.com/pt-br/contate-vendas/).\n\n---\n\n## Cifras\n\nCifras são algoritmos de criptografia utilizados para criptografar *texto simples* (`plaintext`) em *texto cifrado* (`ciphertext`), que requer uma chave para ser descriptografado. A Azion oferece a possibilidade de alterar o grupo de *cifras* que sua edge application usará, a fim de proteger sua aplicação contra ataques TLS.\n\nO grupo de cifras determinará quais algoritmos de criptografia serão utilizados nas conexões TLS da sua edge application. Ambos, cliente e servidor, *negociarão* o grupo de cifras para criptografar e descriptografar os dados trocados durante a sessão, garantindo a confidencialidade deles.\n\nA tabela abaixo mostra as cifras disponíveis em cada grupo.\n\n| Cifra                         | TLSv1.2_2018      | TLSv1.2_2019      | TLSv1.2_2021      | TLSv1.3_2022    |\n|-------------------------------|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:---------------:|\n| TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256        | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✕               |\n| TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384        | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✕               |\n| TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256  | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✕               |\n| ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✔︎               |\n| ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384 | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✔︎               |\n| ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305 | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✔︎               |\n| ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256   | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✔︎               |\n| ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384   | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✔︎               |\n| ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305   | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✔︎               |\n| ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA384     | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✕                 | ✕               |\n| ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA256     | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✕                 | ✕               |\n| ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256       | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✕                 | ✕               |\n| ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384       | ✔︎                 | ✔︎                 | ✕                 | ✕               |\n| AES128-SHA256                 | ✔︎                 | ✕                 | ✕                 | ✕               |\n| AES256-GCM-SHA384             | ✔︎                 | ✕                 | ✕                 | ✕               |\n| AES128-GCM-SHA256             | ✔︎                 | ✕                 | ✕                 | ✕               |\n\n> Na tabela acima, o caractere ✔ indica que a cifra nesta linha está presente no grupo da coluna enquanto ✕ indica que a cifra nesta linha não está presente no grupo da coluna.\n\n---\n\n## Módulos de Edge Application\n\nA Azion disponibiliza **Módulos** que ampliam as capacidades de **Edge Application**. Você pode ativar ou desativar módulos na guia **Main Settings** de sua aplicação, desde que sua conta tenha as permissões e não haja dependências para desativação. Consulte as documentações de cada módulo:\n\n| Módulo | Descrição |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Application Acceleration](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/application-acceleration/) | Otimiza protocolos API e gerencia a entrega de conteúdo dinâmico para acelerar aplicações web e APIs. |\n| [Edge Caching](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/edge-caching/) | Responsável pelas configurações de cache que aceleram a entrega de conteúdo estático e dinâmico. |\n| [Edge Functions](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/edge-functions/) | Permite que você construa aplicações de baixa latência e personalize a entrega do conteúdo. |\n| [Image Processor](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/image-processor/) | Otimiza o processamento de imagens para vários dispositivos, navegadores e resoluções de tela. |\n| [Load Balancer](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/load-balancer/) | Permite que você personalize o tráfego entre múltiplos servidores de origem e provedores de computação em nuvem para melhorar a tolerância a falhas e evitar o congestionamento da rede. |\n\n---\n\n## Limites\n\n### Velocidade de download\n\nAo fazer o download de arquivos grandes em edge applications através de conexões de cerca de 3 MB/s ou mais lentas, o download pode ser resetado. A **Azion Platform** por padrão encerra conexões que excedem a duração máxima da sessão (10 a 15 minutos) e prioriza aplicações dinâmicas e de baixa latência ao invés de transferências de arquivos grandes. Para evitar problemas em downloads, considere mudar para conexões mais rápidas e estáveis ou implementar [file slicing](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/edge-caching/#slice-settings), [compressão](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/use-gzip-mime-types/) e armazenamento em edge caching.

    "body": "\nO Azion **Load Balancer** permite balancear o tráfego para suas origens, data centers ou provedores de cloud, evita o congestionamento de rede e a sobrecarga de seus servidores.\n\n---\n\n## Como funciona\n\nPara alcançar altos níveis de tolerância a falhas e performance, é necessário garantir a disponibilidade do seu conteúdo e aplicações mesmo em caso de incidentes com seus servidores de origem.\n\nCom o **Load Balancer** da Azion, você adiciona múltiplas origens para seu conteúdo, seleciona o método de balanceamento de carga que mais se adequa às suas necessidades e customiza timeouts e tratamento de erros.\n\nAlém disso, detecta falhas e provê múltiplos algoritmos que permitem distribuir a carga para as infraestruturas disponíveis, garantindo a melhor experiência para seus usuários e resultados para sua empresa.\n\n## Balancing method\n\nO *balancing method*, ou método de balanceamento, define como será distribuída a carga entre suas origens pode ser selecionado da seguinte forma:\n\n| Método            | Descrição                                                    |\n| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Round-Robin | Define o algoritmo de balanceamento em rodízio; <br />Leva em consideração o volume de requisições e não o tempo que cada origem demora para responder; <br />Cada origem receberá carga proporcionalmente ao seu peso no round-robin; <br />Origens mais lentas poderão acumular maior número de conexões em paralelo. |\n| Least connections | Mantém o controle do número de conexões ativas com cada origem e envia a próxima requisição sempre para a origem que tiver menor número de conexões; <br />Origens mais lentas receberão menor número de requisições, enquanto origens mais rápidas poderão atender mais requisições sequencialmente. |\n| IP Hash           | Mantém um controle por endereço IP do usuário e tenta, sempre quando possível, associar a mesma origem para cada IP. |\n\n## Host header\n\nO cabeçalho `Host`  é utilizado por sua origem para identificar o *virtualhost* e localizar seu conteúdo ou aplicação. Ao configurar uma origem no [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/), você pode customizar a valor que deve ser enviado pela Azion no cabeçalho `Host`.\n\nSe este campo for deixado em branco, a Azion usará, por default, o mesmo endereço definido no campo **Address**. Deixe o campo **Host Header** em branco se sua origem estiver configurada para responder o *virtualhost* pelo mesmo endereço que está configurado no DNS.\n\nVocê pode preencher um valor customizado do cabeçalho `Host` para ser enviado para sua origem, como `www.azion.com`.\n\n> **Aviso**: você deve customizar o cabeçalho `Host` se sua origem estiver configurada para responder um *virtualhost* em um endereço diferente do que está configurado no DNS.\n\nOu, ainda, você pode utilizar a variável `${host}` no campo **Host Header**, para instruir os edge nodes para repassarem para sua origem o mesmo cabeçalho Host recebido de seus visitantes. Utilize essa configuração se tiver múltiplos *virtualhosts* sendo respondidos pela mesma origem.\n\n## Origin Path\n\nCaso precise que os edge nodes da Azion requisitem o conteúdo de sua origem em um caminho diferente da URI, você pode definir um **Origin Path**. A Azion fará a concatenação do Origin Path com a URI solicitada pelo usuário.\n\n> **Nota**: a definição do Origin Path é opcional. Se não for definido, será utilizada apenas a URI.\n\nPor exemplo, se em sua origem todo o conteúdo fica abaixo do path `/secure`, porém esse caminho não é exibido na URL para seus usuários, você pode definir o `/secure` como **Origin Path** em suas configurações de origem. O restante do caminho será preservado de acordo com a requisição do usuário.\n\n## Origin Protocol Policy\n\nA arquitetura de entrega da Azion permite que você customize o tipo de conexão desejada dos edge nodes para sua origem, como a seguir:\n\n| Tipo de conexão              | Descrição                                                    |\n| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Preserve HTTP/HTTPS protocol | Irá manter o mesmo protocolo de conexão (HTTP ou HTTPS) e porta utilizados por seu usuário ao acessar seu conteúdo na Azion para se conectar em sua origem. |\n| Enforce HTTP                 | A conexão entre os Edge Nodes da Azion e sua origem será por HTTP, independentemente do protocolo de conexão - *HTTP ou HTTPS* - e porta utilizados por seu usuário para acessar seu conteúdo na Azion. Com essa opção, você pode customizar uma porta para sua origem no campo **Address** diferente da porta default (80 para HTTP) se desejar. |\n| Enforce HTTPS                | A conexão entre os Edge Nodes da Azion e sua origem será por HTTPS, independente do protocolo de conexão - *HTTP ou HTTPS* - e porta utilizados por seu usuário para acessar seu conteúdo na Azion. Com essa opção, você pode customizar uma porta para sua origem no campo **Address** diferente da porta default (443 para HTTPS) se desejar. |\n\n## Múltiplas origens\n\nVocê deve adicionar múltiplas origens para alcançar altos níveis de disponibilidade e evitar que um incidente impacte na disponibilidade de seu conteúdo e aplicações, conforme as opções a seguir:\n\n| Opção       | Descrição                                                    |\n| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Address     | Endereço IP ou hostname de sua origem. Você pode customizar a porta da origem, caso tenha definido a Origin Protocol Policy em Enforce HTTP ou Enforce HTTPS, utilizando a notação `host:port`. |\n| Weight      | Você pode definir um peso para cada origem. Esse peso define a proporção de carga que a origem irá receber. Se você definir o peso de uma origem em 3, por exemplo, ela receberá 3 vezes mais carga do que uma origem com peso definido em 1. |\n| Server Role | Se o método de balanceamento selecionado por você for Round-Robin ou Least connections, você pode definir Server Role para cada origem: Primary ou Backup. As origens Backup atuarão como origens *standby* e só receberão carga se todas as origens Primary falharem. |\n| Active      | Para retirar um servidor do balanceamento temporariamente para manutenção, você pode desativá-lo desmarcando o switch **Active**. É necessário pelo menos uma origem ativa para que o conteúdo fique disponível. |\n\n## Customização de timeouts\n\nO Azion **Load Balancer** irá consultar as origens respeitando o método de balanceamento e peso atribuídos por você. Caso alguma origem retorne um erro 404 (Not Found), um erro 5xx ou demore mais do que os timeouts configurados por você para responder, as demais origens serão consultadas antes de retornar qualquer erro para seus usuários.\n\nOs seguintes timeouts padrão do **Load Balancer** podem ser configurados:\n\n* **Connection**: timeout de 60 segundos no estabelecimento da conexão com a origem.\n\n* **Between Bytes**: timeout de 120 segundos entre bytes em uma conexão já estabelecida.\n\n",

    "body": "\nPor meio do **Real-Time Purge** você pode deletar instantaneamente o cache de seu conteúdo na Azion, usando uma *Cache Key List*, uma *URL List* ou uma expressão *Wildcard* que represente os objetos que você deseja remover.\n\n---\n\n## Estratégias de atualização de conteúdo\n\nQuando você atualiza um conteúdo em sua origem, você deve escolher a melhor estratégia para atualização do mesmo no cache da Azion. Veja a seguir as opções disponíveis: tempo de expiração, nomes de objetos com versão e **Real-Time Purge**.\n\nAo configurar sua política de cache, você determina o tempo que deseja que seus objetos fiquem em cache na Azion. Quando você atualiza seu conteúdo na origem, a Azion poderá continuar entregando uma cópia em cache do mesmo, pelo tempo que você tiver definido.\n\nRecomendamos que você utilize alguma marcação de versionamento no nome de seus objetos sempre que possível. Ao atualizar o mesmo na origem, você incrementa a versão no nome do objeto, forçando com que cada modificação de seu conteúdo seja tratada como um novo objeto pela Azion.\n\nCom o Real-Time Purge, você pode deletar instantaneamente o cache de seu conteúdo na Azion, tanto em **Edge Caching** quanto em **L2 Caching**. Dessa forma, o sistema da Azion busca a versão mais recente de seu conteúdo na origem.\n\n> Sempre que possível, utilize políticas de cache com tempos longos para expiração de seu conteúdo, como por exemplo, 1 ano – definindo o campo Maximum TTL com o valor de 31.536.000 segundos. Dessa forma, você estará otimizando a performance de seu conteúdo ou aplicação, melhorando a experiência para seus usuários, reduzindo seu tráfego com a Azion e reduzindo a carga em sua origem.\n\nPara versionar o nome de seus objetos, você pode utilizar como marcação de versão um número sequencial, um timestamp ou outro mecanismo que julgar mais apropriado. Por exemplo, ao invés de nomear uma imagem como `image.jpg`, você poderia chamá-la de `image_1.jpg` e, quando for necessário atualizá-la, incremente a versão para `image_2.jpg`.\n\nDessa forma, toda atualização de seu conteúdo será tratada como um novo objeto pela Azion, o que garante a você as seguintes vantagens:\n\n* permite que você controle qual objeto uma requisição deve retornar, mesmo que o usuário possua a versão anterior localmente gravada no cache do navegador ou em algum cache intermediário. Mesmo que o cache da Azion sofra *purge*, o usuário pode continuar acessando a versão antiga de seus caches locais, até que transcorra o tempo de expiração.\n* versionamento viabiliza que você proporcione versões diferentes de seus objetos para usuários distintos.\n* simplifica também o processo de *rollback* em caso de problemas com sua atualização.\n\n---\n\n## Real-Time Purge\n\nAo disponibilizar uma operação de purge rápida e previsível, a Azion possibilita que você aumente o tempo de expiração (TTL) de seus objetos em cache, ou armazene em cache objetos direcionados a eventos, melhorando *offload* e performance de seu conteúdo ou aplicação, além de reduzir seu tráfego com a Azion.\n\nAo utilizar o **Real-Time Purge** para gerenciar a expiração do cache de seu conteúdo, você também poderá realizar:\n\n* cache de conteúdos dinâmicos e respostas de API, sem sacrificar a experiência de usuário, pois os produtos Edge Caching e L2 Caching serão atualizados com seu conteúdo mais recente.\n* melhor eficiência do cache, garantindo maior controle de como seus objetos são entregues pela Azion.\n* gestão de objetos obsoletos ou desatualizados melhor e mais previsível, auxiliando seus desenvolvedores na construção de soluções confiáveis, resilientes e com melhor performance.\n\nAlém disso, disponibilizamos duas opções de interface para execução de purge de objetos no **Edge Caching** e **L2 Caching** em cache: via [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/) ou via [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/#c01edb72-5221-4ce2-b5d2-ef1c9d781947).\n\n| Campo | Opções |\n| --- | --- |\n| Layer | Edge Caching: Purge do conteúdo da web entregue no edge. <br /> L2 Caching: Purge do conteúdo da web localizado na camada mais próxima à sua origem. |\n| Purge type | Cache Key <br /> URL <br /> Wildcard |\n| Arguments  | `www.example.com.br/index.html`<br />Separe os argumentos usando uma nova linha. |\n\nVocê pode remover o conteúdo tanto na camada de **Edge Caching** – para limpar o conteúdo da web que é entregue no edge – quanto na **L2 Caching** – para limpar o conteúdo da web na camada mais próxima à sua origem.\n\n> **Observação:** Todas as três opções de purge estão disponíveis para a camada Edge Caching. Já para a camada L2 Caching, a opção de purge *Wildcard* ainda não está disponível, ou seja, está disponível o purge de L2 Caching apenas por URL e Cache Key.\n\n---\n\n## Tipos de Purge\n\nVocê pode executar o purge tanto no produto de **Edge Caching** quanto no **L2 Caching** passando como parâmetro a lista de *URLs*, uma expressão *Wildcard* ou a lista de *Cache Keys*.\n\n| URL Purge | Cache Key Purge | Wildcard Purge | \n| --- | --- | --- |\n| É a maneira mais simples de *purge* seu cache de conteúdo, passando uma lista de até 50 objetos por pedido. Você não pode remover as variações do cache de conteúdo com esse método. | É a maneira mais precisa de *purge* seu cache de conteúdo passando uma lista de chaves de cache de até 50 objetos por pedido. | É uma maneira poderosa de *purge* uma lista de objetos passando uma expressão Wildcard. Você pode usar o caractere curinga (`*`) em argumentos de caminho ou query string. |\n\n### URL Purge\n\nPermite o purge dos objetos em cache, passando-se como argumento uma listagem de URLs. O formato da URL deve respeitar o padrão `scheme://host` ou apenas `host`, seguido ou não de um `/path` e da `?query-string`. Ao ocultar o *scheme*, será realizada a expiração dos conteúdos tanto de HTTP quanto de HTTPS.\n\nURL Purge não é recursivo, o que significa que somente as URLs informadas serão expiradas do cache. As URLs são convertidas automaticamente para suas respectivas Cache Keys, sem considerar eventuais variações de conteúdo na mesma URL.\n\n> Variações de conteúdo baseadas em cookies, device groups, formato de imagem ou outras não expiram com essa operação. Considere utilizar **Cache Key Purge** ou **Wildcard Purge** para essas situações.\n\nA expiração de variações do conteúdo baseadas em Query String pode ser realizada usando URL Purge, uma vez que a Query String é uma componente da URL, desde que os argumentos utilizados para variação do conteúdo sejam enviados na ordem correta em que forem apresentados. Se você utiliza a funcionalidade de Query String Sort, ordene os argumentos na requisição ou considere utilizar **Cache Key Purge** ou **Wildcard Purge** como alternativa.\n\n> Se você utilizar o caractere asterisco (`*`) em uma requisição de URL Purge, ele será tratado como um caractere na URL e não como Wildcard.\n\nExemplos de URL Purge:\n\n* `www.seudominio.com`\n* `static.seudominio.com/include/site.css`\n* `static.seudominio.com/include/site.js`\n* `dynamic.seudominio.com/app.py?argument`\n\n### Cache Key Purge\n\nPermite o purge dos objetos em cache, passando-se como argumento uma listagem de Cache Keys.\n\nA Cache Key é uma entrada de índice para um objeto no cache da Azion. O formato padrão de cache key adotado pela Azion utiliza *host* e *path* da URL para identificar objetos. Você pode especificar uma chave de cache avançada para identificar diferentes variações de um objeto, com base em:\n\n* argumentos de Query String ou Query String Sort;\n* cookies – ao utilizar o [Azion Application Acceleration](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/application-acceleration/);\n* formato de imagens de acordo com o suporte do navegador – ao utilizar o [Azion Image Processor](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/image-processor/).\n\nPara obter a Cache Key, deve-se requisitar o conteúdo utilizando o cabeçalho debug da Azion `Pragma: azion-debug-cache`, por exemplo:\n\n```\nHEAD /path HTTP/1.1 Host: seudominio.com Pragma: azion-debug-cache\n```\n\nA resposta retornará um cabeçalho `X-Cache-Key` com a cache key, por exemplo:\n\n```\nX-Cache-Key: seudominio.com/path@@\n```\n\nCada variação do objeto é representada por uma cache key distinta e é expirada individualmente. Por exemplo, se houver uma variação de objeto por device group, cada URL de cada grupo terá uma Cache Key distinta com o separador `@@` e o nome do device group. Para realizar o purge de todas as variações, deve-se buscar a cache key individualmente de cada grupo.\n\nExemplos de Cache Key Purge:\n\n* `www.seudominio.com/@@`\n* `www.seudominio.com/@@Mobile`\n* `static.seudominio.com/include/site.css`\n* `static.seudominio.com/include/site.js`\n* `static.seudominio.com/static/images/image_1.jpg?ims=880x@@`\n* `static.seudominio.com/static/images/image_1.jpg?ims=880x@@webp`\n\n### Wildcard Purge\n\nPermite o purge dos objetos em cache, passando-se como argumento uma expressão Wildcard. O formato da expressão Wildcard deve respeitar o padrão `scheme://host` ou apenas `host`, seguido ou não de um `/path` e da `?query-string`, com caractere asterisco (`*`) no *path* ou na *query string*.\n\nA expressão Wildcard é convertida automaticamente em múltiplos objetos em um mesmo domínio. Para expirar as variações de conteúdo baseadas em cookies, device groups ou formato de imagem, para a mesma URL, utilize a URL com a expressão `@@*` no final. Por exemplo:\n\n* `www.seudominio.com/*`\n* `static.seudominio.com/include/*.css`\n* `static.seudominio.com/*/site.js`\n* `static.seudominio.com/static/images/image_1.jpg?ims=*`\n* `dynamic.seudominio.com/app.py@@*`\n\nVocê pode usar vários wildcards para selecionar um padrão complexo:\n\n* `www.seudominio.com/alpha*`\n* `www.seudominio.com/*beta*`\n* `www.seudominio.com/*a*/charlie`\n* `www.seudominio.com/*a*/*a*`\n* `www.seudominio.com/*?b*`\n* `www.seudominio.com/*?*2*c=*`\n\n---\n\n## Métodos de Purge\n\n### Delete\n\nO método Delete remove o objeto do cache. Na próxima requisição do usuário ao conteúdo, será realizada uma requisição GET incondicional para a origem.\n\nEste método de purge impede que a Azion entregue um objeto desatualizado (*stale*), caso a origem esteja inacessível. Ao invés disso, se a origem estiver inacessível, será entregue uma página de erro.\n\nO uso do método Delete é indicado para:\n\n* remover um conteúdo do cache da Azion, após a remoção do mesmo na origem.\n* forçar a remoção e posterior atualização de conteúdos para os quais o *timestamp* não é confiável.\n* forçar a entrega de uma página de erro no lugar de um objeto desatualizado (*stale*), caso sua origem esteja inacessível e a Azion não consiga obter a versão mais recente de seu conteúdo.\n\n---\n\n## Purge de objetos com variação de conteúdo\n\n### Application Acceleration\n\nAo utilizar variação de conteúdo baseada em Cookies, além do *host* e *path*, a chave de cache incluirá o separador `@@` seguido do nome dos cookies utilizados e valores.\n\nPor exemplo, para uma mesma URL `http://www.seudominio.com/`, utilizando variação de conteúdo baseada no cookie `user`, as chaves de cache poderiam ser:\n\n* `www.seudominio.com/@@`\n* `www.seudominio.com/@@user=user1`\n* `www.seudominio.com/@@user=user2`\n\nPara executar o purge de objetos com variação baseada em cookies, você pode utilizar Cache Key Purge, informando todas as variações individualmente, ou Wildcard Purge, utilizando `@@*` no final.\n\nAo utilizar variação de conteúdo baseada em Query String, além do `host` e `path`, a chave de cache incluirá o separador `?` e os argumentos de query string utilizados. Por exemplo:\n\n* `dynamic.seudominio.com/product.py?id=1000`\n* `dynamic.seudominio.com/product.py?id=1001`\n\nPara executar o purge de objetos com variação baseada em query string, você pode utilizar Cache Key Purge, informando todas as variações individualmente, ou Wildcard Purge, utilizando `?*` no final, ou ainda URL Purge, informando na URL apenas os argumentos utilizados na cache key. Caso você utilize Query String Sort, os argumentos terão que ser enviados na ordem correta.\n\n### Image Processor\n\nAo utilizar o Image Processor, você estará utilizando uma chave de cache avançada. Além de `host` e `path`, a chave de cache incluirá o separador `?` e os argumentos do produto, além do separador `@@` para identificação de variação por formato de imagem suportada pelo navegador.\n\nSão exemplos de chaves de cache utilizando o Image Processor:\n\n* `static.seudominio.com/static/images/image.jpg@@ `\n* `static.seudominio.com/static/images/image.jpg@@webp`\n* `static.seudominio.com/static/images/image.jpg?ims=88x@@`\n* `static.seudominio.com/static/images/image.jpg?ims=88x@@webp`\n\nPara executar o purge de imagens processadas pelo Image Processor, você pode utilizar Cache Key Purge, informando todas as variações individualmente, ou Wildcard Purge, utilizando `*` no final.\n\n### Slice Configurations\n\nSe você utiliza a otimização de cache para entrega de arquivos grandes – *sliced files* – como em mídias para *Progressive Download*, você estará utilizando uma chave de cache avançada. Além de `host` e `path`, a chave de cache incluirá o separador `@@bytes=`, para cada *slice* do conteúdo.\n\nSão exemplos de chave de cache utilizando otimização para entrega de arquivos grandes:\n\n* `static.seudominio.com/midias/file.mp4@@bytes=0-1048575`\n* `static.seudominio.com/midias/file.mp4@@bytes=1048576-2097151`\n\nPara executar o purge de objetos utilizando essa otimização, você deve utilizar Wildcard Purge, colocando `@@*` no final. Você também pode utilizar o Cache Key Purge, desde que informe a cache key de todos os *slices* corretamente.\n\nTome cuidado ao executar o purge para um *slice* individualmente, pois em caso de alteração do conteúdo na origem, o mesmo poderá ficar inconsistente no cache.\n\n---\n\n### Método POST e HTTP\n\nPor padrão, a Azion permite o cache apenas dos métodos `GET` e `HEAD`. Você pode habilitar o cache `POST` ou `OPTIONS` na aba **Cache Settings**, dentro das configurações da Edge Application que usará uma advanced cache key. Além do host e do path, a cache key incluirá o separador @@ seguido pelo hash MD5 do corpo da requisição (`POST` arguments).\n\n#### Sintaxe\n\n| Exemplo método POST | Exemplo método OPTIONS |\n| --- | --- |\n| `dynamic.seudominio.com/path@@md5_of_post_arguments` | `dynamic.seudominio.com/path@@md5_of_options_arguments` |\n\nPara limpar esses objetos, você pode usar um Cache Key Purge, inserindo todas as variações individualmente ou um Wildcard Purge, usando `@@*` no final.\n\n### Custom Configurations\n\nSe você possui uma Custom Configuration com uma chave de cache customizada, você deve utilizar o Cache Key Purge para deletar o cache de seus objetos. Além de `host` e `path`, a chave de cache poderá incluir o separador `@@` seguido de seus argumentos customizados.\n\n`dynamic.seudominio.com/path@@custom_arguments`\n\nÉ necessário que você consulte o formato customizado de sua chave de cache para executar o Cache Key Purge.\n\n---\n\n## Confirmação do Purge\n\nO *purge* é uma operação que não requer confirmação. Uma vez que o *purge* é concluído quase que instantaneamente, nenhuma confirmação da operação é necessária e você pode considerar que seus purges serão concluídos em menos de 3 segundos, exceto no caso de uso consistente dos Rate Limits.\n\nQuando necessário, você poderá consultar o histórico de purges para saber o usuário que realizou a requisição, horário, lista de argumentos, tipo e método de purge.\n\n---\n\n## Limites\n\nA operação de purge é executada conforme os seguintes limites de uso, baseados no tipo e no número de objetos que estão sendo expirados:\n\n* **URL** e **Cache Key Purges**: até 10 mil objetos a cada 60 segundos, sendo até 200 requisições com 50 objetos por requisição, por cliente. A URL e a Cache Key são limitadas em 4.096 caracteres;\n* **Wildcard Purges**: até 2 mil requisições por dia (por intervalo de 24h), sendo uma Wildcard URL por requisição. A Wildcard URL é limitada em 256 caracteres;\n* O histórico de purges é limitado a 6 meses e até 1 milhão de requisições.\n",

    "body": "\nO **Rules Engine** é uma capacidade do [Edge Application](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/) que controla a execução de comportamentos através de operadores lógicos. Através do Rules Engine, você pode construir uma arquitetura que proporciona melhor performance para seus usuários consumindo menos recursos e processando na origem.\n\n---\n\n## Como funciona\n\nCada requisição de uma aplicação construída com o Azion [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/) é processada numa sequência fixa de duas fases: primeiro a **Request Phase**, depois a **Response Phase**.\n\nEm cada fase de processamento, você pode definir um conjunto de regras para tratar a requisição de acordo com as necessidades da sua aplicação ou negócio. Uma vez selecionada a fase em que a sua regra será executada, você pode criar uma nova regra.\n\nAs regras são concebidas para seguir uma lógica condicional *se-então*. Cada regra é composta de **Criteria** (*se*), que são os critérios que definirão o conjunto de condições que devem ser cumpridas para a execução de **Behaviors** (*então*), ou comportamentos.\n\nVocê pode utilizar variáveis, operadores de comparação e operadores lógicos para desencadear os comportamentos desejados para a sua aplicação. Se as condições forem cumpridas, os comportamentos de cada regra são executados até que todas as regras sejam processadas.\n\n> **Aviso**: alguns comportamentos podem terminar a execução das regras. Se uma sequência de regras incluir tal comportamento, quaisquer regras ou comportamentos que sejam adicionados após o finalizador não serão executados.\n\nAntes de criar uma regra, você deve ativar o módulo [Application Acceleration](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/application-acceleration/), que expande a usabilidade do **Rules Engine**, pois habilita funcionalidades de computação serverless à **Edge Application**. Caso o módulo não seja ativado, somente algumas variáveis e comportamentos estarão disponíveis para o Rules Engine.\n\n> Consulte o guia [Criando regras de Request e Response usando o Rules Engine para Edge Application](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/sites-estaticos-na-edge/) para um passo a passo sobre como configurar regras usando o Rules Engine.\n\n---\n\n## Fases de processamento\n\nAo criar uma regra, você será solicitado a selecionar uma das duas fases de processamento disponíveis: **Request Phase** ou **Response Phase**.\n\n### Request Phase\n\nNa **Request Phase**, você pode controlar como a requisição de seu usuário é processada de acordo com suas regras de negócio e definir quais origens devem tratar da requisição caso o conteúdo não seja armazenado em cache.\n\nVocê pode usar qualquer variável relacionada aos dados enviados por seu usuário na requisição como variáveis para as regras da Request Phase. Como a resposta ainda não foi processada pela requisição, você não tem acesso às variáveis relacionadas ao conteúdo que será entregue a seu usuário nesta fase.\n\nÉ nessa fase que você define como a Azion deve gerenciar o cache de sua aplicação. Se sua aplicação não permitir nenhum tipo de cache, as condições para ignorar o cache podem ser definidas.\n\n### Response Phase\n\nNa **Response Phase**, sua aplicação trata do conteúdo que será entregue a seus usuários. Todo o processamento na Response Phase é dinâmico e é realizado individualmente para cada usuário.\n\n---\n\n### Descrição\n\nAlém do nome da regra, você pode adicionar uma descrição para ela usando o campo **Description**. Sua descrição ficará visível na lista de regras e pode ser usada para identificar o que a regra faz.\n\n---\n\n## Criteria \n\nA seção **Criteria** do **Rules Engine** é onde você define os critérios para a execução da regra. Critérios são compostos de:\n\n- variáveis\n- operadores de comparação\n- argumentos, quando aplicável\n\nA inclusão de argumentos em um critério depende dos operadores de comparação escolhidos, e seus formatos estão descritos nas seções [variáveis](#variaveis) e [operadores de comparação](#operadores-de-comparacao). [Operadores lógicos](#operadores-logicos) servem para incrementar a quantidade de comparações que a regra irá executar.\n\nPor exemplo, o seguinte critério identifica se um usuário está usando um navegador web desktop para acessar sua aplicação através de uma expressão regular como argumento:\n\n|  | Variável  | Operador de comparação | Argumento |\n| --- | ---- | --- | --- |\n| If | `${http_user_agent}` | *matches* | `(Chrome|Mozilla)` |\n\n### Variáveis \n\n| Variável | Descrição | Fases em que pode ser utilizada |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `${arg_name}` | Argumento *name* enviado pelo usuário na linha de requisição (query string). Por exemplo, para a requisição GET `/path?Search=test`, a variável `${arg_search}` assumirá o valor `test`. | Request Phase <br />Response Phase |\n| `${args}` | Todos os argumentos enviados pelo usuário na linha de requisição (query string). Por exemplo: para a requisição GET `/path?Search=test`, a variável assumirá o valor `Search=test`. | Request Phase <br />Response Phase |\n| `${cookie_name}` | Valor do cookie name. Por exemplo, para o `cookie_icl_current_language=pt-br`, a variável `${cookie_icl_current_language}` assumirá o valor `pt-br`. | Request Phase <br/>Response Phase |\n| `${device_group}` | Grupo do dispositivo do usuário. Você pode personalizar [grupos de dispositivos](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/device-groups/) na aba **Device Groups** de sua aplicação no Real-Time Manager. | Request Phase <br />Response Phase |\n| `${domain}` | Similar à variável `${host}`. Armazena o host name ou o cabeçalho Host da requisição, removendo o último subdomínio após o domínio de segundo nível. Por exemplo: para um domínio `az.blog.dominio.com`, essa variável irá carregar o valor `blog.dominio.com`. | Request Phase <br />Response Phase |\n| `${geoip_city}` | Nome da cidade por extenso, utilizando a base de geolocalização `geoip_city`. Por exemplo: `Sao Paulo`, `London`. | Request Phase <br />Response Phase |\n| `${geoip_city_continent_code}` | Código de continente com 2 letras, utilizando a base de geolocalização `geoip_city`. Por exemplo: `EU` para Europa, `NA` para América do Norte. | Request Phase <br />Response Phase |\n| `${geoip_city_country_code}` | Código de país com 2 letras, utilizando a base de geolocalização `geoip_city`. Por exemplo: `RU` para Rússia, `BR` para Brasil. | Request Phase <br />Response Phase |\n| `${geoip_city_country_name}` | Nome do país por extenso, utilizando a base de geolocalização `geoip_city`. Por exemplo: `United States`, `Brazil`. | Request Phase <br />Response Phase |\n| `${geoip_continent_code}` | Código de continente com 2 letras. Por exemplo: `EU` para Europa, `NA` para América do Norte. | Request Phase <br />Response Phase |\n| `${geoip_country_code}` | Código de país com 2 letras, utilizando a base de geolocalização `geoip_country`. Por exemplo: `RU` para Rússia, `BR` para Brasil. | Request Phase <br />Response Phase |\n| `${geoip_country_name}` | Nome do país por extenso, utilizando a base de geolocalização `geoip_country`. Por exemplo: `United States`, `Brazil`. | Request Phase <br />Response Phase |\n| `${geoip_region_name}` | Nome do país por extenso, utilizando a base de geolocalização `geoip_region`. Por exemplo: `Ontario`, `Sao Paulo` etc. | Request Phase <br />Response Phase |\n| `${geoip_region}` | Código da região com 2 letras. Por exemplo: `RS` para Rio Grande do Sul, `ON` para Toronto etc. | Request Phase <br />Response Phase |\n| `${host}` | Em ordem de precedência: o host name da linha de requisição, ou o valor do campo de cabeçalho Host da requisição, ou o nome do servidor atendendo a requisição. Por exemplo: `blog.domain.com`. | Request Phase <br />Response Phase |\n| `${http_name}` | O valor do campo de cabeçalho da requisição. `name` deve ser um [cabeçalho HTTP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Request_header) válido convertido em letras minúsculas; hífens devem ser convertidos para underscore. Por exemplo: `${http_accept}` assumirá o valor da campo de cabeçalho `Accept` da requisição HTTP. | Request Phase <br />Response Phase |\n| `${remote_addr}` | O endereço IP do cliente que está realizando a requisição HTTP. | Request Phase <br />Response Phase |\n| `${remote_user}` | O username fornecido pela autenticação básica, quando houver. | Request Phase <br />Response Phase |\n| `${request}` | A linha completa da requisição. | Request Phase <br />Response Phase |\n| `${request_method}` | O método HTTP da requisição. Por exemplo: `GET`. | Request Phase <br />Response Phase |\n| `${request_uri}` | A URI completa da requisição, com argumentos (query string). | Request Phase <br />Response Phase |\n| `${scheme}` | O scheme da requisição: `http` ou `https`. | Request Phase <br />Response Phase |\n| `${sent_http_name}` | O valor do campo de cabeçalho de resposta name. O argumento name deve ser convertido para letras minúsculas e os hífens devem ser convertidos para underscore. Por exemplo: `${sent_http_content_length}` assumirá o valor do cabeçalho Content-Length. | Response Phase |\n| `${status}` | O status code da resposta. | Response Phase |\n| `${upstream_addr}` | O endereço IP e porta da origem consultada para obtenção da resposta. Caso múltiplas origens sejam consultadas durante o processamento da requisição, os endereços serão separados por vírgula. Por exemplo: `192.168.1.1:80, 192.168.1.2:80`. Se um redirect interno de um grupo de servidores para outro ocorrer, iniciado por um `X-Accel-Redirect` ou por uma página de erro, os endereços dos diferentes grupos serão separados por “:”. Por exemplo: `192.168.1.1:80, 192.168.1.2:80 : 192.168.10.1:80, 192.168.10.2:80`. | Response Phase |\n| `${upstream_cookie_name}` | Valor do cookie name enviado pela origem através do campo de cabeçalho Set-Cookie. Caso múltiplas origens sejam consultadas durante o processamento da requisição, apenas os cookies da última origem são armazenados. | Response Phase |\n| `${upstream_http_name}` | Valor do campo de cabeçalho name enviado pela origem. O argumento name deve ser convertido para letras minúsculas e os hífens devem ser convertidos para underscore. Caso múltiplas origens sejam consultadas durante o processamento da requisição, apenas os cabeçalhos da última origem são armazenados. Por exemplo: `${upstream_http_server}` assumirá o valor do campo de cabeçalho Server enviado pela última origem consultada. | Response Phase |\n| `${upstream_status}` | Status Code da resposta da origem enviada para o RTM. Caso múltiplas origens sejam consultadas durante o processamento da requisição, os status codes serão separados por vírgula. Se um redirect interno de um grupo de servidores para outro ocorrer, iniciado por um “X-Accel-Redirect” ou por uma página de erro, os status codes dos diferentes grupos serão separados por “:”. | Response Phase |\n| `${uri}` | A URI normalizada (urldecoded) da requisição. O valor da `${uri}` pode mudar durante o processamento de uma requisição, por exemplo, quando ocorre um redirect interno ou quando são utilizados arquivos index. NÃO carrega os parâmetros do Query String como `${request_uri}` faz. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |\n\n### Operadores de Comparação \n\n| Operador | Descrição | Tipo de argumento |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| is equal | O valor da variável é igual ao argumento, comparado caracter a caracter. | string |\n| is not equal | O valor da variável não é exatamente igual ao argumento. | string |\n| starts with | O valor da variável inicia pelo argumento. | string |\n| does not start with | O valor da variável não inicia pelo argumento. | string |\n| matches | O valor da variável coincide com a expressão regular informada como argumento. | regular expression |\n| does not match | O valor da variável não coincide com a expressão regular informada como argumento. | regular expression |\n| exists | A variável tem valor definido. Por exemplo `${arg_search}` existe se foi enviado um argumento *search* na query string da requisição. | - |\n| does not exist |A variável não tem valor definido. Por exemplo `${arg_search}` não existe se não foi enviado um argumento *search* na query string da requisição. | - |\n\n### Operadores Lógicos \n\nMúltiplos critérios podem ser adicionados por meio dos operadores lógicos **AND** e **OR**. Com isso, cada regra pode conter até 10 critérios.\n\nO operador **AND** tem precedência implícita sobre o operador **OR**. Se for necessária precedência explícita, você pode adicionar múltiplos grupos de critérios apenas sob a lógica **AND**.\n\n---\n\n## Behaviors \n\nNa seção de **Behaviors** da **Rules Engine**, você adiciona os comportamentos que deseja executar, caso as condições da regra sejam atendidas.\n\nPor exemplo, esse comportamento redireciona o usuário para uma versão em inglês de um *path* de FAQ:\n\n|  Comportamento  | Argumento |\n| --- | --- |\n| Redirect To (302 Found) | `/en-us/faq` |\n\nCada regra pode carregar até 10 comportamentos.\n\nEm cada fase de processamento, comportamentos distintos estão disponíveis.\n\n| Behavior | Descrição | Fases em que pode ser utilizado | Requisitos |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Add Request Cookie | Adiciona um cookie no cabeçalho `Set-Cookie` da requisição. O valor do cookie deve ser informado como argumento no formato `cookie-name=cookie-value`.<br />Você pode usar uma variável como valor de cookie, por exemplo: `cookie-name=${arg_cookie}`. | Request Phase | [Application Acceleration](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/application-acceleration/) |\n| Add Response Cookie | Adiciona um cookie no cabeçalho `Set-Cookie` da resposta. O valor do cookie deve ser informado como argumento no formato `cookie-name=cookie-value`.<br /><br />Para cookies de resposta, você pode adicionar as seguintes [políticas de Set-Cookie](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie) ao argumento, separadas do valor do cookie por ponto e vírgula (`;`):<br /><li>`Expires=date` (EEE, d MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss Z)</li><li>`Domain=domain-value`</li><li>`Path=path-value`</li><li>`Max-age=number` (TTL in seconds, takes precedence over `Expires`)</li><li>`SameSite=value; Secure`</li><li>`HttpOnly`</li><br />Múltiplas políticas também são permitidas se separadas por ponto e vírgula (`;`). Por exemplo: `cookie-name=cookie-value; Domain=domain-value; Path=path-value; SameSite=value`.<br />Você também pode usar variáveis no lugar de valores, por exemplo: `Path=${uri}; Domain=${host}`. | Response Phase | [Application Acceleration](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/application-acceleration/) |\n| Add Request Header | Adiciona um campo de cabeçalho na requisição que será enviada a origem. O campo de cabeçalho deve ser informado como argumento no formato `Field:value`. | Request Phase | - |\n| Add Response Header | Adiciona um campo de cabeçalho na resposta que será enviada para o usuário. O campo de cabeçalho deve ser informado como argumento no formato `Field: value`. | Response Phase | - |\n| Bypass Cache | Define que a Azion não deverá armazenar em cache a resposta de sua origem. A execução desta regra não tem impacto sobre o cache no browser dos usuários, o qual deve ser definido utilizando o behavior *Set Cache Policy*. | Request Phase | [Application Acceleration](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/application-acceleration/) |\n| Capture Match Groups | Behavior de apoio para manipulação de strings. Armazena em uma variável temporária o resultado da captura de grupos de correspondência definidos por uma regex aplicada a um dos campos da requisição HTTP disponibilizados. Essa variável temporária pode ser posteriormente referenciada no behavior *Rewrite Request* para montar a string de reescrita.<br />Este behavior requer três argumentos:<br />*captured array name:* o nome que você deseja dar a variável temporária onde será armazenado o array de strings capturadas.<br />*subject:* o campo da requisição HTTP de onde você deseja capturar alguma string.<br />*regex:* a expressão regular usada para capturar as strings. Cada grupo capturado deve ser representado entre parênteses.<br /><br />Por exemplo, para capturar o caminho e o nome  de um arquivo em uma requisição HTTP, você pode utilizar:<br />*captured array name:* `capture`<br />*subject:* `${uri}`<br />*regex:* `^(./)([^/])$`<br />Você poderá referenciar a variável de captura como um array utilizando a notação `%{*variable[index]*}`. Por se tratar de uma variável local, você só poderá utilizá-la dentro da mesma regra que estiver configurando. Neste exemplo, se a URI for `/path/image.jpg`, a variável de captura apresentará os seguintes valores:<br />`%{capture[0]} = “/path/image.jpg”`<br />`%{capture[1]} = “/path/”`<br />`%{capture[2]} = “image.jpg”`<br /><br />Você também pode nomear os índices, para referenciá-los usando nomes em vez de um índice numérico. Para tanto, utilize a notação `?<name>` como no exemplo:<br />*captured array name:* `capture`<br />*subject:* `${uri}`<br />*regex:* `^(?<path>.*/)(?<filename>[^/]*)$` | Request Phase | [Application Acceleration](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/application-acceleration/) |\n| Deliver | Encerra o processamento da requisição e entrega o conteúdo para o usuário, sem executar nenhuma das regras seguintes. Ao utilizar o behavior Deliver, você estará forçando o término do processamento imediatamente. | Request Phase <br />Response Phase | - |\n| Deny (403 Forbidden) | Entrega um *403 Forbidden* para o usuário. Por se tratar de uma regra finalizadora, esse behavior encerra o processamento da requisição. | Request Phase | - |\n| Enable Gzip | Ativa a compressão de dados em gzip, caso suportada pelo browser do usuário. Consulte o guia de [Como habilitar compressão gzip](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/use-gzip-mime-types/) para mais informações. | Request Phase <br />Response Phase | - |\n| Enable Sliced Files | Ativa segmentação de objetos grandes em slices de 1MB, caso sua origem tenha suporte a HTTP range requests. Utilize este behavior se você entrega mídias com mais de 1MB através da CDN para que a Azion possa iniciar a entrega do conteúdo para seus usuários mesmo antes de ter recebido todo o objeto de sua origem e, dessa forma, otimizar a performance de seu site ou aplicação.<br /><br />Ao ativar esta funcionalidade, a Azion irá requisitar os objetos para sua origem via range requests e os mesmos serão cacheados na Azion com advanced cache key.<br /><br />Caso sua origem não tenha suporte a range requests, a Azion só poderá iniciar a entrega de seu conteúdo para seus usuários após sua origem finalizar o envio completo do objeto. | Default Rule | - |\n| Enforce HLS cache | Este behavior é incluído automaticamente pela Azion toda vez que você selecionar uma origem do tipo Live Ingest. Duas ações são executadas nessa situação: o bypass de todas suas regras da Cache Phase e a imposição da política de cache definida pela Azion para transmissões live em HLS.<br /><br />A política de cache da Azion para transmissões live em HLS é de 5 segundos de cache para playlists (.m3u8) and 60 segundos de cache para chunks (.ts).| Request Phase | Live Ingest |\n| Filter Request Cookie | Remove um cookie do cabeçalho da requisição que será enviada para a origem. Como argumento, você pode informar o nome do cookie que deseja remover no formato `cookie-name`.<br /><br />Para remover apenas valores específicos, você deve informar o nome e valor do cookie no formato `cookie-name=cookie-value`. | Request Phase | [Application Acceleration](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/application-acceleration/) |\n| Filter Response Cookie | Remove um cookie cabeçalho da requisição que será enviada para o usuário. Como argumento, você pode informar o nome do cookie que deseja remover no formato `cookie-name`.<br /><br />Para remover apenas valores específicos, você deve informar o nome e valor do cookie no formato `cookie-name=cookie-value`. | Response Phase | [Application Acceleration](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/application-acceleration/) |\n| Filter Request Header | Remove um campo do cabeçalho da requisição que será enviada para a origem. O nome do cabeçalho deve ser informado como argumento, por exemplo: `Header-Name`. | Request Phase | - |\n| Filter Response Header | Remove um campo do cabeçalho da resposta que será enviada para o usuário. O nome do cabeçalho deve ser informado como argumento, por exemplo: `Header-Name`. | Response Phase | - |\n| Forward Cookies | Ao utilizar o behavior Forward Cookies você estará determinando que a Azion encaminhe para seus usuários o cabeçalho `Set-Cookie` recebido de sua origem, mesmo na situação de conteúdo em cache (cache hit).<br /><br />Para evitar que um usuário receba o cabeçalho `Set-Cookie` da sessão de outros usuários, consulte o guia sobre [Forward Cookies](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/edge-caching/#forward-cookies). | Request Phase | [Application Acceleration](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/application-acceleration/) |\n| Optimize Images | Ativa a otimização de imagens. | Request Phase | [Image Processor](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/image-processor/) |\n| Redirect HTTP to HTTPS | Redireciona a requisição HTTP para a respectiva URL em HTTPS. Caso a requisição já seja HTTPS, não executa nenhum comportamento. | Request Phase | Aplicação HTTPS. |\n| Redirect To (301 Moved Permanently)<br /><br />Redirect To (302 Found) | Esses comportamentos redirecionam o usuário para uma outra URL informada como argumento, retornando o status code *301 Moved Permanently* ou *302 Found*.<br /><br />É recomendado que estes comportamentos sejam utilizados para mudanças de caminhos: *301 Moved Permanently* para mudanças permanentes e *302 Found* para mudanças mudanças temporárias.<br /><br />Por se tratarem de regras finalizadoras, esses behaviors encerram o processamento da requisição.<br /><br />**Atenção**: na Response phase, os behaviors Redirect To apenas serão executados quando a origem retorna um erro 404. | Request Phase <br />Response Phase | - |\n| Rewrite Request | Modifica o path do recurso que será requisitado para a origem. Você pode reescrever o path do recurso utilizando:<br />uma string<br />as variáveis da requisição (as mesmas que podem ser utilizadas em Criteria)<br />as variáveis locais, no formato `%{name[index]}`, com o resultado de captura de strings, ao utilizar o behavior auxiliar *Capture Match Groups*.<br /><br />Por exemplo, se você deseja que a requisição de um usuário para o recurso `/original/image.jpg` seja enviada para sua origem como `/new/image.jpg`, você pode:<br /><li>Utilizar o behavior auxiliar *Capture Match Groups* com os argumentos:<br />*captured array name*: `capture`<br />*subject*: `${uri}`<br />*regex*: `/original/(.)`</li><br /><li>Utilizar o behavior *Rewrite Request* com o argumento `/new/%{capture[1]}`</li> | Request Phase | [Application Acceleration](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/application-acceleration/) |\n| Run Function | Executa uma função criada no **Edge Functions** e instanciada pela aba **Edge Functions** da edge application.

As políticas de cache devem ser previamente configuradas na aba **Cache Settings**. Na política de cache você configura o tempo que o objeto deve ser armazenado em cache e as regras para variação dos objetos em cache (advanced cache key). | Request Phase | - |\n| Set Origin | Atribui a origem que deve ser consultada pelo Intelligent Edge. As origens devem ser previamente configuradas na aba **Origins**. | Request Phase | - |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Funções\n\nPara os **behaviors** que solicitam um argumento obrigatório, você pode utilizar as mesmas variáveis que estão disponíveis em cada fase de processamento. Dessa forma você pode, por exemplo, compor cookies ou cabeçalhos HTTP utilizando dados coletados da requisição, tais como o **Device Groups** do usuário ou sua geolocalização.\n\nA Azion também disponibiliza algumas funções para simplificar a manipulação de seus argumentos:\n\n| Função e Argumento | Descrição |\n| --- | --- |\n| `${cookie_time_offset(number)}` | Retorna a data atual acrescida de um offset em segundos, informado como argumento, para ser utilizado na definição do tempo de expiração de um cookie. Por exemplo, se você deseja que o cookie expire em 1 hora, utilize o behavior *Add Response Cookie* com o argumento: `cookie-name=cookie-value; Expires=${cookie_time_offset(3600)}` |\n| `${encode_base64(string)}` | Retorna o argumento codificado em base64. Por exemplo, `${encode_base64 (www.domain.com)}` retornará o valor `d3d3LmRvbWFpbi5jb20K` |\n\n---\n\n## Variáveis para Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) \n\nUtilize essas variáveis no **Rules Engine** da sua edge application para configurar **Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS)**.\n\nSaiba mais sobre [suporte para mTLS](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-application/domains/mtls/) e a diferença entre os modos *Enforce (standard)* e *Permissive*.\n\n| Variável                   | Descrição                                                                                                                         | Fase       |\n|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| `${ssl_client_fingerprint}`  | Retorna o *Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1)* do *client certificate*.                                                              | Requisição |\n| `${ssl_client_escaped_cert}` | Retorna o *client certificate* no formato *Private Enhanced Mail (PEM)** `.pem`, como uma *URL encoced string*.                   | Requisição |\n| `${ssl_client_s_dn}`         | Retorna o \"subject DN\" do *client certificate*.                                                                                   | Requisição |\n| `${ssl_client_s_dn_parsed}`  | Retorna o \"subject CN\" (extraído do \"subject DN\") do *client certificate*.                                                        | Requisição |\n| `${ssl_client_cert}`         | Retorna o *client certificate* no formato PEM.

    "body": "\nPor meio do **Single Origin** você poderá configurar o endereço de sua origem e ajustar parâmetros.\n\n---\n\n## Funcionalidades do Single Origin \n\nCom **Single Origin** você adiciona uma origem para seu conteúdo e customiza **Host Header**, método de conexão e credenciais de autenticação.\n\n### Host Header\n\nO cabeçalho Host é utilizado por sua origem para identificar o *virtualhost* e localizar seu conteúdo ou aplicação. Ao configurar uma origem no Real-Time Manager, você pode customizar a valor que deve ser enviado pela Azion no cabeçalho Host.\n\nSe este campo for deixado em branco, a Azion usará, por *default*, o mesmo endereço definido no campo **Address**. Deixe o campo **Host Header** em branco se sua origem estiver configurada para responder o *virtualhost* pelo mesmo endereço que está configurado no DNS.\n\nVocê pode preencher um valor customizado de **Host Header** para ser enviado para sua origem. Por exemplo, www.azion.com. Você deve customizar o **Host Header** se sua origem estiver configurada para responder um *virtualhost* em um endereço diferente do que está configurado no DNS.\n\nOu ainda, você pode utilizar a variável `$host` no campo **Host Header**, para instruir os edge nodes para repassarem para sua origem o mesmo cabeçalho Host recebido de seus visitantes. Utilize essa configuração se tiver múltiplos *virtualhosts* sendo respondidos pela mesma origem.\n\n### Origin Path\n\nCaso precise que os Edge Nodes da Azion requisitem o conteúdo de sua origem em um caminho diferente da URI, você pode definir um **Origin Path**. A Azion fará a concatenação do Origin Path com a URI solicitada pelo usuário.\n\nA definição do **Origin Path** é opcional. Se não for definido, será utilizada apenas a URI.\n\nPor exemplo, se em sua origem todo o conteúdo fica abaixo do **path** `/secure`, porém esse caminho não é exibido na URL para seus usuários, você pode definir o `/secure` como **Origin Path** em suas configurações de origem. O restante do caminho será preservado, de acordo com a requisição do usuário.\n\n### Origin Protocol Policy\n\nA arquitetura de entrega da Azion permite que você customize o tipo de conexão desejada dos Edge Nodes para sua origem:\n\n| Tipo de conexão              | Descrição                                                    |\n| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Preserve HTTP/HTTPS protocol | Irá manter o mesmo protocolo de conexão - *HTTP ou HTTPS* -  e porta utilizados por seu usuário ao acessar seu conteúdo na Azion para se conectar em sua origem. |\n| Enforce HTTP                 | A conexão entre os Edge Nodes da Azion e sua origem será por HTTP, independente do protocolo de conexão (HTTP ou HTTPS) e porta utilizados por seu usuário para acessar seu conteúdo na Azion. Com essa opção, você pode customizar uma porta para sua origem no campo **Address** diferente da porta default (80 para HTTP) se desejar. |\n| Enforce HTTPS                | A conexão entre os Edge Nodes da Azion e sua origem será por HTTPS, independente do protocolo de conexão (HTTP ou HTTPS) e porta utilizados por seu usuário para acessar seu conteúdo na Azion. Com essa opção, você pode customizar uma porta para sua origem no campo **Address** diferente da porta default (443 para HTTPS) se desejar. |\n\n### Address\n\nApós a definição dos campos acima, adicione a origem informando o endereço IP ou hostname FQDN – *Full Qualified Domain Name* - de sua origem.\n\nVocê pode também customizar a porta da origem, caso tenha definido a _Origin Protocol Policy_ em _Enforce HTTP_ ou _Enforce HTTPS_, utilizando a notação `host:port`.\n\n### HMAC Authentication\n\nVocê pode incluir uma Single Origin onde sua origem se encontra em um *Object Storage* com acesso privado, com autenticação através de HMAC.\n\nAo habilitar o *HMAC Authentication*, o seu conteúdo privado passará a ser entregue aos seus usuários pela Edge Application. Deve-se incluir nas credenciais de acesso HMAC, *Region*, *Access Key* e *Secret Key* fornecidos pelo seu *Object Storage provider*. \n\nA Secret Key fica protegida sendo exibida apenas para seus usuários com permissão de escrita e mantendo sua segurança de acesso.\n\n### Timeouts\n\nExibe configuração de *timeout* em segundos pré definida pela Azion. Os valores de *timeout* não podem ser customizados.\n\n---\n\n## Configuração uma Single Origin\n\nPara configurar uma Single Origin:\n\n1.  Acesse o [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/) , entre no menu **Products** no canto superior esquerdo , em **Edge Computing** selecione **Edge Application**;\n2.  Adicione ou edite a configuração de **Edge Application** desejada;\n3.  Na aba **Origins**, adicione ou edite uma origem para seu conteúdo;\n4.  Selecione **Single Origin** no campo **Origin Type** e preencha os demais campos solicitados;\n5.  Clique no botão **Save** para salvar suas alterações;\n6.  Acesse a aba **Rules Engine** para editar ou adicionar regras para um ou mais **paths** através do **Behavior: Set Origin**.\n\n\n",

    "body": "\nA plataforma de Edge da Azion conta com mecanismos nativos ou programáveis de detecção e bloqueio automatizado de ameaças, passíveis de serem integrados a serviços de segurança e bases de inteligências de terceiros para uma proteção completa e de baixa latência. Dessa forma, ataques complexos em seus conteúdos, aplicações e serviço de DNS podem ser evitados diretamente no edge, mesmo que você ainda utilize uma infraestrutura de origem on-premise ou em cloud, uma vez que a mitigação será estendida para o edge independentemente de sua rede ser ipv4, ipv6 ou híbrida.\n\nA proteção DDoS é integrada em cada uma das nossas edge locations e também está conectada a múltiplos centros de mitigação em todo o mundo para efetiva mitigação o mais próximo da origem do ataque. Como participante fundador da iniciativa MANRS, liderada pela Internet Society, fortalecemos a segurança do roteamento de rede utilizando filtros de AS-path rigorosos, aplicando, assim, a devida diligência na verificação de anúncios de clientes, bem como na de nossos próprios anúncios, além de realizarmos a validação de endereços de origem para redes de clientes, usuários finais e infraestrutura para evitar falsificação – _spoofing_ – de endereços IP.\n\nCom tais práticas de roteamento de rede baseado em software (SDN Routing), associadas a análise de pacotes de rede (DPI ou Deep Packet Inspection) em tempo real nas edges, com algoritmos de análise de anomalias e assinaturas de tráfego para mitigação automática de ataques, assim como de algoritmos de mais alto nível para a detecção e mitigação dos mais complexos e variados tipos de ataques em tempo real, neutralizamos ameaças de sequestro BGP (BGP Hijack), ataques de negação de serviços (DoS e DDoS) sem impactar na latência de entrega.\n\nA proteção DDoS cobre todos os produtos e serviços, incluindo o serviço de DNS da Azion, provendo assim segurança e disponibilidade também para a resolução de endereços.\n\nEm um melhor esforço de enumerar de forma não exaustiva alguns ataques passíveis de mitigação, começamos por classificar os ataques DDoS:\n\n**Ataques baseados em volume**: também conhecidos como ataques de inundação, esse tipo de ataque usa uma forma de amplificação ou de requisições de malwares e worms potencialmente coordenadas por um botnet para criar grandes quantidades de tráfego e sobrecarregar um sistema.\n\n**Ataques de protocolo:** também conhecidos como ataques de exaustão de estado, os ataques de protocolo concentram-se na exploração de vulnerabilidades em recursos de rede, sobrecarregando o processamento de serviços e infraestruturas críticas tais como de segurança e balanceamento de carga.\n\n**Ataques da camada de aplicação**: também conhecidos como ataques de camada 7, esse tipo de ataque visa indisponibilizar aplicação, afetando serviços como o DNS e o HTTP.\n\nEm um melhor esforço, enumeramos abaixo **de forma não exaustiva** alguns ataques DDoS passíveis de mitigação com a Azion:\n\n* Bogons\n* Botnet attacks\n* Brute force attacks\n* Connection flood attacks\n* DNS flood (including well formed DNS Queries)\n* HTTP floods (including HTTP well formed POST / GET URL requests)\n* HTTP Slow Reads\n* ICMP Flood\n* IGMP Flood\n* IP Bogons\n* IP Fragmentation\n* Low and Slow attacks\n* MALFORMED ICMP Flood (Ping of death)\n* MIXED Floods (TCP+UDP, ICMP+UDP, etc.)\n* Nuke\n* OWASP top 10\n* Reflected ICMP / UDP\n* Slowloris\n* Smurf\n* Spoofing\n* TCP ACK Flood\n* TCP ACK-PSH Flood\n* TCP SYN-ACK Flood\n* TCP FIN Flood\n* TCP Out of state Flood\n* TCP RESET Flood\n* TCP SYN Flood\n* TCP Fragmentation\n* TCP Invalid\n* Teardrop\n* UDP Flood\n* Zero-day attacks\n\nComo exemplo de técnicas de detecção e mitigação empregadas, sem intenção de esgotar o assunto, podemos citar:\n\n* análise de padrões e detecção de anomalias;\n* allowlists (regras permitidas), blocklists (listas de bloqueio) e greylists (listas cinzas);\n* bloqueio baseado em assinaturas / fingerprints;\n* bloqueio baseado em score;\n* bloqueio, redirecionamento ou descarte (drop) de acordo com headers HTTP, geolocalização, entre outros parâmetros;\n* bloqueio, redirecionamento ou descarte (drop) de acordo com reputação, network lists, etc;\n* captcha e recaptcha para identificação de usuários humanos e descarte de pacotes mal formados;\n* fingerprinting;\n* network lists de botnets, cloud providers, malwares, proxies, etc;\n* proteção contra adulteração (cookie tampering);\n* rate limit (limite de taxa de acessos) simples (local) e avançada (global, contextual);\n* regras em standby ( para serem utilizadas em resposta a incidentes à medida que eles acontecem);\n* redirecionamento HTTP;\n* reputação dinâmica de IPs, fingerprints, IP+user agents, etc;\n* restrição de acesso na origem apenas para endereços IP’s da Azion;\n* técnicas de mitigação e gestão de bots;\n* técnicas de prevenção contra ataques de brute force;\n* técnicas desafio-respostatimeout de sessõestokens de segurança (security token, JWT, etc).\n\nOs registros e o monitoramento dos ataques podem ser feitos por meio do Real-Time Metrics da Azion ou por um grande número de SIEMs (Security Information and Event Management). Além disso, contam com serviços de Big Data conhecidos de mercado, que podem ser facilmente integrados à Azion.\n\nA Azion adota uma estratégia centrada em segurança em nossos produtos e serviços, provendo aos clientes uma segurança _zero-trust_ programável e extensível, sempre segura e visível, com criptografia de ponta a ponta.\n\nPrezamos prioritariamente pela construção de algoritmos para detecção e bloqueio automático de ataques. Uma vez que uma ameaça é identificada, nosso Security Response Team acompanha as ameaças do início ao fim e poderá vir a aplicar regras customizadas para mitigação de sofisticados ataques das camadas de rede, transporte e aplicação. Essas regras serão aplicadas instantaneamente pela arquitetura de tempo real da plataforma de Edge da Azion, permitindo a proteção rápida e eficiente de seu conteúdo ou aplicação. Assim sendo, construímos e suportamos, em parceria com nossos clientes, mecanismos eficientes e eficazes de mitigação de ataques.\n\n",

    "body": "\nO Azion **Edge Firewall** é um produto de segurança que protege desde a camada de rede até a camada de aplicação. Em um único local, seu time de segurança encontra os recursos mais avançados para proteger suas aplicações contra todos os tipos de ataque.\n\nCom o **Edge Firewall**, você amplia o perímetro de segurança até o edge da rede, uma vez que suas regras de controle de acesso são processadas diretamente na Azion Edge Network, mais perto dos usuários, evitando que requisições indesejadas cheguem a sua origem ou que tenham acesso às suas aplicações.\n\n> Por ser programável, modularizado e extensível, permite que você escolha os módulos que se adequam às suas necessidades.\n\nVocê pode disponibilizar e executar seu próprio código fonte de proteção direto na rede distribuída da Azion. Isso favorece o usuário final e a própria aplicação, pois o usuário tem acesso a uma aplicação protegida e com baixa latência. Ataques complexos podem ser evitados estendendo o perímetro de proteção para o edge.\n\n#### Com o Edge Firewall você pode:\n\n- criar _allowlists_ (regras permitidas), _blocklists_ (listas de bloqueio) e _greylists_ (listas cinzas) com base no endereço IP/CIDR, ASN ou geolocalização do usuário;\n- proteger suas aplicações da rede Tor e outras fontes de tráfego malicioso, como botnets, malwares, proxies, etc;\n- limitar a taxa de acessos à aplicação usando critérios complexos e vários buckets;\n- mitigar ataques Denial of Service (ataque distribuído de negação de serviço, DoS e DDoS);\n- proteger aplicações de ameaças _OWASP_ Top 10;\n- implementar técnicas de mitigação de bot, incluindo listas de bloqueio, _fingerprinting_, proteção contra adulteração, prevenção contra ataques de _brute force_, _rate limiting_ avançada, desafio humano, etc;\n- adicionar seu código fonte de proteção ou de controle de acesso ao seu conteúdo para ser executado no **Edge Firewall**;\n- integrar perfeitamente Functions com curadoria Azion ou produtos de terceiros para serem executados no **Edge Firewall**, estendendo funcionalidades nativas da plataforma com soluções prontas para a reputação de IP, _fingerprinting_, token JWT, _credential stuffing_, tentativas de _account takeover_, _price scraping_ e _contact scraping_ etc.\n\n---\n\n## Como funciona\nAo utilizar a Azion como sua plataforma de edge computing, você pode criar configurações de segurança no **Edge Firewall** para proteger suas aplicações.\n\nAs configurações de **Edge Firewall**, chamadas de _Rule Sets_, são conjuntos de regras de segurança que devem ser aplicadas a um grupo de domínios.\n\n> Você pode compartilhar a mesma _Rule Set_ entre todas as aplicações que adotarem a mesma política de segurança.\n\nUma _Rule Set_ do **Edge Firewall** é composta por uma seleção de domínios onde deve ser aplicada, por módulos que devem ser aplicados e pelas regras de segurança configuradas em _Rules Engine_.\n\n**Os módulos do Edge Firewall habilitam as seguintes funcionalidades que você irá utilizar:**\n\n> DDoS Protection\n>\n> Edge Functions\n>\n> Network Layer Protection\n>\n> Web Application Firewall\n\nVocê precisa de, no mínimo, um módulo ativado para poder utilizar o produto e, para garantir a segurança de suas aplicações em todas as camadas, _recomendamos que você ative todos_.\n\nApós ativar os módulos desejados, você deve configurar suas regras de segurança no _Rules Engine_. As regras que você configurar serão executadas sequencialmente até que a requisição seja bloqueada, penalizada ou até que todas suas regras sejam processadas, quando então a requisição é liberada. O fluxo de dados de sua requisição só passa para sua edge application se nenhuma de suas regras de Edge Firewall bloquear ou rejeitar a requisição, garantindo que requisições maliciosas não alcancem a sua aplicação.\n\nCada regra é composta por condições - _Criteria_ -  e comportamentos - _Behaviors_. Os comportamentos só serão executados se as condições forem satisfeitas. Por exemplo, você pode configurar regras para bloquear requisições que vierem de IPs que estiverem em uma _Blocklist_ ou mesmo compor regras, para excluir IPs que estiverem em uma _Whitelist_. Neste exemplo, \"bloquear\" é o comportamento - _Behavior_, enquanto o IP da requisição estiver na _Blocklist_ e não estiver presente na _Whitelist_ é a condição - _Criteria_.\n\n> As condições e comportamentos disponíveis no **Edge Firewall** dependem dos módulos que você tiver ativado na _Rule Set_.\n\n---\n\n## Módulos do Edge Firewall\n\nO Azion Edge Firewall possui os seguintes módulos para que você possa construir suas _edge applications_ de alta performance, escalabilidade e segurança com muito mais simplicidade e livre de tarefas operacionais.\n\n### DDoS Protection\n\nO módulo de _DDoS Protection_ protege seu conteúdo e aplicações contra ataques do tipo _Distributed Denial of Service_ (_DDoS_), pois detecta ataques usando algoritmos avançados que são executados na rede distribuída da Azion. Essa rede distribuída está conectada a diversos centros de mitigação de uma forma que conseguimos garantir a mitigação durante ataques de larga escala, tanto em nível de rede quanto de aplicação.\n\nPor meio de uma moderna abordagem de detecção e mitigação de ataques das camadas de rede, transporte e aplicação, reduzimos o downtime sem impactar na performance de seu serviço.\n\n[Leia mais](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-firewall/ddos-protection/)\n\n---\n\n### Edge Functions\n\nEdge Functions são componentes da plataforma Edge Computing da Azion que permitem a implementação de funções serverless em suas aplicações, desonerando sua infraestrutura, executando funções mais próximas do usuário, garantindo a agilidade e a escalabilidade necessárias para atender seus objetivos de negócio.\n\nVocê poderá se beneficiar de uma arquitetura baseada em microsserviços, criando facilmente funções executadas mais próximas aos usuários.\n\nVocê também poderá escrever seu próprio código fonte de segurança e fazer o seu deploy para que seja executado na Edge Location perto do usuário ou, ainda, escolher entre soluções prontas para uso tornando, assim, mais simples a sua implementação, que pode ser feita em poucos passos.\n\nÉ possível usar soluções de segurança para proteger dados sensíveis de detecção, identificação e gerenciamento de bots (botnets), abrangendo a proteção de sites, aplicações, APIs e aplicativos móveis contra ataques, na Edge Network.\n\nVocê também pode utilizar Edge Functions para configurar um serviço de reputação de IP que abrange proteção de sites, aplicações, APIs e aplicativos móveis, bem como adulteração de parâmetros da web e adulteração de cookies.\n\n[Leia mais](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-firewall/edge-functions-instances/)\n\n---\n\n### Network Layer Protection\n\nEste módulo possibilita a criação de filtros por endereços de IP/CIDR, ASN ou por países (_geolocation_) através da configuração de Network Lists e da definição de regras de negócio que validarão critérios de bloqueio ou de liberação, conforme a sua necessidade, especificados no _Rules Engine_  de seu _Edge Firewall_.\n\nAtuando nas camadas 3 e 4 do modelo _OSI_, o Network Layer Protection é uma ferramenta poderosa que consiste em uma opção segura e eficiente de proteger seu negócio contra ataques e acessos de usuários indesejados. Estende o período de proteção desde o Edge da rede, perto do usuário final.\n\n[Leia mais](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-firewall/network-layer-protection/)\n\n#### Add-on Origin Shield\n\nCom este add-on do Azion Edge Firewall, você poderá criar um perímetro de segurança para a sua infraestrutura de origem, seja ela um provedor de cloud, hosting ou mesmo o seu próprio datacenter. Com este serviço, sua origem poderá restringir o acesso apenas de endereços IP’s específicos da nossa rede e bloquear qualquer outro acesso à sua origem.\n\nPermite que o acesso só possa ser feito através de edge nodes da Azion, pois eles vão levar a aplicação para perto do usuário final com toda performance e segurança.\n\n---\n\n### Web Application Firewall\n\nWeb Application Firewall (WAF) protege as suas aplicações contra ameaças como SQL Injections, Remote File Inclusion (RFI), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) e muito mais. O WAF analisa as requisições HTTP e HTTPS, detecta e bloqueia ameaças antes que elas alcancem a sua infraestrutura e sem impactar na performance de suas aplicações.\n\nAtua na camada 7 ao nível da aplicação e é baseado em _scoring_, ou seja, cada requisição é comparada com um conjunto bem rigoroso e detalhado de padrões de aplicação e recebe uma pontuação - _score_ - que é associada a uma determinada família de ameaças. De acordo com a pontuação que essa requisição tem, ela pode ser liberada ou bloqueada. Isso ocorre direto no Edge Node da Azion, antes que a ameaça atinja a sua origem ou cause qualquer tipo de dano. É possível customizar a sensibilidade desejada e ter um bloqueio diferenciado para cada família de ameaça.\n\n[Leia mais](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-firewall/web-application-firewall/)\n\n\n",

Você terá um maior número de combinações para proteção se o módulo _Web Application Firewall_ também estiver ativado.\n\n\n## Network Lists\n\nPor meio de **Network Lists** você pode criar, consultar ou atualizar Network Lists utilizadas no _Rules Engine_ do _Edge Firewall_. Adicione e mantenha suas próprias listas em **Network Lists** por meio do Real-Time Manager ou API. Uma mesma Network List pode ser associada a mais de uma Rule ou Rule Set do Edge Firewall. Sempre que a Network List é atualizada, se propagará automaticamente em todas as rules que contiverem na associada. Para saber mais e aprender a utilizar essa funcionalidade, consulte a documentação de [Network Lists](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-firewall/network-layer-protection/network-lists/).\n\n***\n\n## Origin Shield\n\nCom este add-on do Azion Network Layer Protection, você poderá criar um perímetro de segurança para a sua infraestrutura de origem, seja ela um provedor de _cloud_, _hosting_, seja mesmo o seu próprio _data center_. Com esse serviço, sua origem poderá restringir o acesso apenas de endereços IP’s específicos da nossa rede e bloquear qualquer outro acesso à sua origem.\n\nNossa lista de IP’s pode sofrer alterações frequentes, mas após atualizá-la só colocaremos os novos servidores em produção para quem utiliza o add-on Origin Shield 7 dias após a publicação da lista. É possível também acompanhar e rastrear as mudanças realizadas na lista por meio do _History_ do Real-Time Manager. Através do Histórico, você pode localizar quais IP's foram adicionados ou deletados da lista.\n\nNosso processo de \"quarentena\" permite incluir novos endereços com uma semana de antecedência, ou seja, sempre que um novo endereço entrar na lista, ficará em stand by por 7 dias antes de receber carga, dando a você esse prazo para atualizar suas regras de firewall.\n\n> Todos os usuários com o produto ativado são notificados pelo e-mail cadastrado no RTM quando os endereços são alterados.\n\n**Origin Shield** está disponível através do Real-Time Manager ou pela nossa API.

Sempre que uma Network List é associada a uma regra, ela é comparada com o endereço IP do cliente que está realizando a requisição HTTP, levando em conta os operadores de comparação configurados na Rule do *Rules Engine*.\n\n#### **Os tipos de Network List são:**\n\n| Tipo      | Descrição                                                    |\n| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| IP/CIDR   | Corresponde a uma lista de endereços IP ou CIDR, devendo ser preenchido um endereço por linha. Se preferir, informe também a máscara de sub-rede dos endereços IP. |\n| ASN       | AS Number refere-se a *Alocação de Números de Sistema Autônomo* que corresponde a um grupo de redes de endereços IP gerenciado por um ou mais operadores de rede que têm uma clara e única política de roteamento. Consultando o serviço de ASN Whois da [LACNIC](http://lacnic.net/cgi-bin/lacnic/whois?lg=EN), o ASN da Azion, por exemplo, é AS52580. Escolha o tipo ASN para representar uma lista de grupos AS, devendo ser preenchido um endereço por linha, somente o número sem prefixo. |\n| Countries | Corresponde a uma lista de países. Para incluir países na lista, selecione os itens na aba *Available Countries* e mova para a aba *Chosen Countries*. |\n\nDepois de criar uma *Network List* associe a uma ou mais *Rules* ou *Rules Sets* que tenham o módulo *Network Layer Protection* ativado.\n\n> Uma **Network List** terá efetivo uso quando associada a uma ou mais Rules no **Edge Firewall Rules Engine** por meio do condicional - **Criteria** - Network; para isso, o módulo **Network Layer Protection** deve estar habilitado.\n\nPara proporcionar ainda mais agilidade aos seus processos, a Azion provê e mantém algumas **Network Lists** atualizadas automaticamente e prontas para usar. Uma delas é a *Network List Azion IP Tor Exit Nodes*, que contém os endereços IP de saídas da rede *Tor* e poderá ser utilizada em uma ou mais Rules, por meio do da condição - *Criteria* - Network, de acordo com suas necessidades de negócio.\n\n> O conteúdo das Network Lists providas pela Azion não pode ser editado.\n\n",

    "body": "\nO **Rules Engine** foi elaborado para que você implemente sua lógica de segurança na edge. Com base em critérios programáveis, você escolhe o que deseja fazer.\n\nConfira algumas das possibilidades do **Rules Engine** para você: bloquear uma requisição; ignorar uma requisição; limitar a taxa de acesso; aplicar uma política de WAF; executar uma edge function com seu próprio código de segurança; e ainda monitorar o tráfego para identificar ameaças. Saiba mais a seguir.\n\n## Conhecendo o Rules Engine\n\n### Como funciona\n\nCada requisição de seus usuários para sua aplicação é processada primeiro pelo **Edge Firewall**.\n\nVocê pode definir um conjunto de regras de segurança no **Edge Firewall**. As regras são compostas por critérios, que representam as condições para execução da regra, e por comportamentos, que representam as ações que precisam ser executadas.\n\nO processamento das regras é sequencial e você pode utilizar como critérios um poderoso conjunto de variáveis e operadores de comparação. Caso as condições sejam atendidas, os comportamentos de cada regra são executados até que todas as regras sejam processadas ou se encontre uma regra com um comportamento finalizador no caminho – _Deny_ ou _Drop_.\n\n## Regras\n\nAs regras são compostas sempre por condições – *criteria* – e comportamentos – *behaviors*. Você também pode adicionar uma *descrição* para sua regra.\n\n### Descrição\n\nAlém do nome da regra, você pode adicionar uma descrição para ela usando o campo **Description**. Sua descrição ficará visível na lista de regras e pode ser usada para identificar o que a regra faz.\n\n### Criteria\n\nDeterminam o conjunto de condições que precisam ser atendidas para a execução dos *Behaviors* – comportamentos.\n\n#### Variáveis\n\n| Criteria               | Descrição                                                    | Requisitos               |\n| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |\n| Header Accept          | Cabeçalho que informa quais tipos de mídia que o cliente aceita para a resposta. | Web Application Firewall |\n| Header Accept-Encoding | Cabeçalho que informa quais os tipos de codificação de conteúdo, geralmente algoritmos de compressão, que o cliente aceita para a resposta. | Web Application Firewall |\n| Header Accept-Language | Cabeçalho que informa sobre a linguagem esperada.            | Web Application Firewall |\n| Header Cookie          | Cabeçalho que contém os cookies enviados pelo cliente na requisição para o servidor. | Web Application Firewall |\n| Header Origin          | Cabeçalho que informa a origem de uma requisição de acesso cross-site ou de uma requisição preflight. A origem é uma URI indicando o nome do servidor, sem nenhuma informação de caminho. | Web Application Firewall |\n| Header Referer         | Cabeçalho que indica o endereço do documento, ou elemento em um documento, a partir do qual a URI da requisição foi obtido. | Web Application Firewall |\n| Header User Agent      | Cabeçalho com uma sequência característica que permite que servidores identifiquem o aplicativo, sistema operacional, fornecedor e/ou versão do dispositivo. | Web Application Firewall |\n| Hostname               | Em ordem de precedência: o *hostname* da linha de requisição, ou o valor do campo de cabeçalho *host* da requisição, ou o nome do servidor atendendo a requisição. | -                        |\n| Network                | O endereço IP do cliente que está realizando a requisição HTTP, que poderá ser utilizado para qualquer comparação de rede (CIDR, ASN ou Country). | Network Layer Protection |\n| Request Args           | Todos os argumentos enviados pelo usuário na linha de requisição (*query string*). | Web Application Firewall |\n| Request Method         | O método HTTP da requisição. Por exemplo: GET, POST, PUT etc. | -                        |\n| Request URI            | Refere-se à variável `uri` da Rules Engine for Edge Applications. O URI normalizado (urldecoded) da requisição. O valor de `uri` pode mudar durante o processamento de uma requisição, por exemplo, quando ocorre um redirecionamento interno ou quando são utilizados arquivos de índice. Ele NÃO carrega os parâmetros da Query String como `request_uri` faz. | -                        |\n| *Scheme*               | O scheme da requisição: http ou https.                       | -                        |\n| Client Certificate Validation | Processo do servidor para autenticar o certificado digital do cliente | - |\n\n#### Operadores de Comparação\n\nA condição para execução de uma regra deve ser a comparação de uma variável com um argumento. Os operadores de comparação são:\n\n\n| Operador            | Descrição                                                    | Argumento                  |\n| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |\n| is equal            | O valor da variável é igual ao argumento, comparado caracter a caracter. | string                     |\n| is not equal        | O valor da variável não é exatamente igual ao argumento.     | string                     |\n| starts with         | O valor da variável inicia pelo argumento.                   | string                     |\n| does not start with | O valor da variável não inicia pelo argumento.               | string                     |\n| matches             | O valor da variável coincide com a expressão regular ou lista informada como argumento. | regular expression<br />list |\n| does not match      | O valor da variável não coincide com a expressão regular ou lista informada como argumento. | regular expression<br />list |\n| exists              | A variável tem valor definido. Por exemplo, Request Args existe se for enviado um argumento na query string da requisição. | -                          |\n| does not exist      | A variável não tem valor definido. Por exemplo, Request Args não existe se não for enviado um argumento na query string da requisição. | -                          |\n\n> **Observação**: As opções variam de acordo com o *Criteria* selecionado.\n\n#### Operadores Lógicos\n\nMúltiplas condições podem ser definidas por meio dos operadores lógicos \"*and*\" e \"*or*\". O operador \"*and*\" tem precedência implícita sobre o operador \"*or*\".\n\nSe necessária precedência explícita, você pode adicionar múltiplos grupos de critérios sob a lógica \"*and*\".\n\n### Behaviors\n\nEm **Behavior** você adiciona os comportamentos que deseja executar caso as condições da regra sejam satisfeitas.\n\n| Behavior                      | Descrição                                                    | Requisitos               |\n| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |\n| Deny (403 Forbidden)          | Encerra a requisição com resposta HTTP *403 Forbidden*.      | -                        |\n| Drop (Close Without Response) | Encerra a requisição sem responder ao cliente.               | -                        |\n| Set Rate Limit                | Define um limite de taxa de acesso que, se excedido, resultará em resposta HTTP *429 Too Many Requests*. Para configurar *Rate Limit*, você deverá informar: <br />**Type**, é o campo para selecionar o tipo de requisição do Rate Limit, optando por **Req/s** (Requisições por Segundo) ou **Req/Min** (Requisições por Minuto); <br />**Average Rate Limit**, que é a taxa limite por segundo, propriamente dita; <br />**Client IP address**, se você deseja que a contabilização da taxa de acesso seja por endereço **IP do cliente** ou **Global**, caso deseje contabilização total da taxa de acesso; <br />**Maximum burst size***, que indica o tamanho máximo da rajada de requisições HTTP enviadas simultaneamente, as quais serão enfileiradas e despachadas gradualmente, respeitando-se a taxa limite. <br />`* O Maixumum Burst size está disponível apenas para o tipo de requisição \"Req/s\" (Requisição por Segundo).`<br />O valor configurado será o Rate Limit em cada Azion Edge Node, implementado por meio do algoritmo de Leaky Bucket. Recomendamos que você utilize *Maximum burst size* no máximo 10 vezes o valor configurado em *Average Rate Limit*, o que resultaria em penalizar a última requisição de uma rajada com até 10 segundos de atraso.<br /> |                          |\n| Set WAF Rule Set              | Associa a Rule Set de WAF que deve ser utilizada na requisição.

O WAF analisa as requisições HTTP e HTTPS, detecta e bloqueia atividades maliciosas antes que elas alcancem a sua infraestrutura, sem impactar na performance de suas aplicações.\n\n---\n\n## Criar uma WAF Rule Set para suas aplicações\n\n**WAF Rule Set** é o conjunto de regras que protege contra os mais variados tipos de ataque. Nela estão definidas as proteções que você deseja ativar, o nível de sensibilidade da detecção e a _whitelist_.\n\n#### Para criar uma *WAF Rule Set*:\n\n1.  Acesse o [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/) e entre no menu **Edge Libraries** > **WAF Rules**;\n2.  Clique no botão **Add WAF** para adicionar uma nova **WAF Rule Set**;\n3.  Dê um nome sugestivo para o seu **WAF**. Você vai precisar dele para realizar posteriormente a associação da **Rule Set** através do **Rules Engine**.\n4.  Selecione o **Mode** desejado: **Counting** ou **Blocking**;\n5.  Ative as proteções e selecione um dos cinco níveis de sensibilidade desejados na aba **Main Settings** > **Threat Type Configuration**;\n6.  Clique no botão **Save**. \n\n**Counting Mode** é usado para especificar que o **WAF** não deve bloquear nenhum pedido. Ele analisará seu tráfego e contará as ameaças. O **Blocking Mode** é usado para analisar e bloquear as ameaças detectadas, protegendo sua aplicação de usuários maliciosos.\n\n> Recomendamos que você ative a regra em **Counting Mode** no primeiro momento, para acompanhar a amostra de ameaças detectadas na etapa de aprendizagem, antes de efetivamente bloquear as requisições. Dessa forma, você poderá também ajustar a sensibilidade da detecção, de acordo com a sua aplicação.\n\nDurante o **Counting Mode** é recomendado que você deixe todas as proteções ativadas para que possa monitorar as ameaças detectadas pelo WAF.\n\nSe forem detectados falsos positivos, algumas regras poderão ser incluídas na _whitelist_ pelo Suporte da Azion, sem a necessidade de desativar a proteção completa para uma família de ameaças. Entre em contato se desejar avaliar a necessidade de incluir regras em _whitelist_, antes de desabilitar a sua proteção.\n\nPor fim, a **Rule Set** deve estar *ativa* para que o WAF analise as suas requisições. O checkbox **Active** serve para permitir que você habilite e desabilite o WAF rapidamente para todos os *paths* que estiverem associados a **Rule Set**.\n\n\n---\n\n## Monitorar a detecção de ameaças\n\nDeixe a **WAF Rule Set** em  **Counting Mode ** pelo tempo que julgar necessário para que a maior parte das funcionalidades de sua aplicação sejam cobertas. \n\n> Você deve acompanhar os gráficos da aba **WAF** pelo **Real-Time Metrics** > **Edge Applications** ou os **logs do WAF** por meio dos produtos **Real-Time Events** e **Data Streaming**.\n\nNo **Real-Time Metrics**, o primeiro gráfico da aba *WAF (Threats vs Requests)* apresenta três séries temporais:\n\n*   **Regular Requests:** todas as requisições HTTP e HTTPS analisadas pelo WAF e consideradas seguras.\n*   **Threats:** o volume de ameaças detectadas pelo WAF e contabilizadas, quando em  **Counting Mode**. Essas ameaças não estão sendo bloqueadas nesse momento.\n*   **Threats Blocked:** ameaças efetivamente bloqueadas pelo WAF. Para começar a bloquear as ameaças encontradas, a rule set tem que estar em **Blocking Mode**.\n\nSe você possuir também o serviço **Data Streaming**, é possível acompanhar informações mais detalhadas sobre IP, data e horário de acesso, status code, família de ataque detectada e modo de atuação configurado.\n\n\n~~~\n$time-iso8601 $azion-client-id $azion-virtualhost-id $azion-configuration-id $azion-solution $azion-solution-id $host $conn-request-time $req-method $resp-status $req-uri $waf-threat-family $waf-threat-action $client-geoip-country-name $client-geoip-region-name $client-addr $client-port $req-header(User-Agent) $req-header(Referer) 2017-01-04T17:00:19+00:00 1234a 10203b 1020304050 ha 1441740010 www.yoursite.com 0.129 GET 200 /request-uri?key=value $XSS $LEARNING-BLOCK Brazil Sao Paulo 1.2.3.4 61511 Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/55.0.2883.87 Safari/537.36 https://www.yoursite.com/referrer 2017-01-04T17:00:19+00:00 1234a 10203b 1020304050 ha 1441740010 www.yoursite.com 0.025 POST 200 /request-uri $SQL $LEARNING-BLOCK Brazil Santa Catarina 2.3.4.5 61513 Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/55.0.2883.87 Safari/537.36 https://www.yoursite.com/referrer 2017-01-04T17:00:40+00:00 1234a 10203b 1020304050 ha 1441740010 www.yoursite.com 0.026 GET 301 /request-uri?key=value $RFI $LEARNING-BLOCK Brazil Rio de Janeiro 5.6.7.8 26102 Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 5.1.1; SM-G800H Build/LMY47X) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/55.0.2883.91 Mobile Safari/537.36 https://www.yoursite.com/referrer 2017-01-04T17:00:41+00:00 1234a 10203b 1020304050 ha 1441740010 www.yoursite.com 0.391 POST 200 /request-uri $UWA $LEARNING-BLOCK Brazil Rio Grande do Sul 9.10.11.12 26102 Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 5.1.1; SM-G800H Build/LMY47X) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/55.0.2883.91 Mobile Safari/537.36 https://www.yoursite.com/referrer\n~~~\n\nCom base nessas informações, você pode ajustar a sensibilidade da *WAF Rule Set*, até que não ocorram mais falsos positivos.

    "body": "\nO **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** protege as suas aplicações contra ameaças do tipo *SQL Injections*, *Remote File Inclusion (RFI)*, *Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)*, entre outras vulnerabilidades web. O WAF analisa as requisições HTTP e HTTPS, detecta e bloqueia atividades maliciosas antes que elas alcancem a infraestrutura da sua aplicação.\n\nO WAF atua na sétima camada do modelo OSI, a da aplicação (*application layer*), onde acontece o relacionamento das aplicações web com seus respectivos serviços de rede e dados de usuários. Também funciona como uma barreira para filtrar e monitorar o tráfego entre a sua aplicação e a internet.  \n\n---\n\n## Como funciona\nO **Web Application Firewall** é um módulo do Azion **Edge Firewall** baseado na metodologia de *scoring* de requisições. Cada requisição HTTP/HTTPS é comparada com um conjunto bem rigoroso e detalhado de padrões de aplicação e recebe uma pontuação (*score*) que é associada a uma determinada família de ameaças.\n\nDe acordo com o *score* recebido pela requisição, ela poderá ser liberada ou bloqueada diretamente nos edge nodes da Azion, antes que a ameaça atinja sua origem ou cause qualquer tipo de dano. Você define o nível desejado de sensibilidade para o bloqueio de cada família de ameaças.\n\nPara evitar o bloqueio de requisições lícitas e o mau funcionamento de sua aplicação, você deve executar uma etapa de aprendizagem na qual o **WAF Rule Set** identifica os comportamentos legítimos de sua aplicação, inserindo-os em uma lista de permissões (*allowlist*).\n\nTambém é possível flexibilizar o funcionamento do WAF, através da aba **Tuning**, caso tenha tráfego interno, testes e falsos positivos sendo barrados pelo WAF.\n\n> Para utilizar os recursos de WAF Rule Sets é necessário habilitar o módulo Web Application Firewall no Edge Firewall Rule Set.\n\n---\n\n## Criando um WAF\n\nPara acessar a página do WAF:\n\n1. Acesse o [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).\n2. Abra o Products menu, indicado pelo ícone ☰, e na categoria *Edge Libraries*, clique em **WAF Rules**. Essa página irá mostrar todos os WAFs criados.\n3. Caso não tenha nenhum WAF configurado, clique no botão **Add WAF**. \n\nO botão o enviará para a página de configuração do WAF, com o campo para adicionar um *nome identificador*, as abas **Main Settings**, **Tuning** e **Allowed Rules**, além da tabela **Threat Type Configuration**, onde você define o nível de sensibilidade para cada família de ameaças. \n\n---\n\n## Main Settings\n\nA tabela **Threat Type Configuration** está disponível na aba **Main Settings**. Aqui, as ameaças são categorizadas em famílias, conforme o objetivo do ataque.\n\n| Família de ameaça            | Descrição                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| SQL Injections Sensitivity   | Detecta tentativas de ataque do tipo injeção de código SQL, por meio dos dados do cliente para a aplicação.                                                                                                                                         |\n| Remote File Inclusions (RFI) | Detecta tentativas de incluir arquivos, normalmente por meio de scripts no servidor web.                                                                                                                                                            |\n| Directory Traversal          | Previne a exploração de vulnerabilidade referente à sanitização insuficiente de campos de nomes de arquivo fornecidos pelos usuários, de modo que caracteres representando atalhos para o diretório pai sejam passados por meio da API de arquivos. |\n| Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)   | Previne a injeção de *scripts client-side* em páginas vistas por seus visitantes.                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| File Upload                  | Detecta a tentativa de envio de arquivos para o servidor web.                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Evading Tricks               | Protege contra alguns truques de codificação utilizados para tentar escapar dos mecanismos de proteção.                                                                                                                                             |\n| Unwanted Access              | Detecta as tentativas de acesso a páginas administrativas ou vulneráveis, bots e ferramentas de *scanning* de segurança.                                                                                                                            |\n| Identified Attacks           | Previne vários tipos de ataques comuns e vulnerabilidades conhecidas que certamente deverão ser bloqueados.\n\nVocê também pode ativar ou desativar a proteção para cada família de ameaças individualmente através do switch **Active**, na terceira coluna.\n\n### Níveis de sensibilidade e seus scores equivalentes\n\nA sensibilidade define o rigor com o qual o WAF irá considerar uma requisição como uma ameaça.

Essa sensibilidade tem um menor nível de proteção para suas aplicações, mas também evitará o bloqueio de requisições com menor chance de representar ameaças (falsos positivos).          |\n| Low           | A requisição será considerada uma ameaça se apresentar indícios muito fortes e receber um *score* do WAF maior ou igual a 24. Essa sensibilidade tem um menor nível de proteção para suas aplicações, mas também evitará o bloqueio de requisições com menor chance de representar ameaças (falsos positivos).          |\n| Medium        | A requisição será considerada uma ameaça se apresentar indícios suficientes e receber um *score* do WAF maior ou igual a 16.                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| High          | Ao menor indício de uma ameaça, a requisição poderá ser bloqueada, mesmo quando apresentar um *score* do WAF maior ou igual a 8. Esse nível de sensibilidade pode apresentar mais falsos positivos se a etapa de aprendizagem não tiver cobertura suficiente sobre a variabilidade de cenários e usos de sua aplicação. |\n| Highest       | Ao mínimo indício de uma ameaça, a requisição poderá ser bloqueada, mesmo quando apresentar um *score* maior ou igual a 4. Esse nível de sensibilidade pode apresentar muitos falsos positivos se a etapa de aprendizagem não tiver cobertura suficiente sobre a variabilidade de cenários e usos de sua aplicação.     |\n\nCada nível de sensibilidade tolera um número definido de indícios de ameaças, o score do WAF representa essa quantidade de indícios de ameaças. Por isso, quanto mais flexível é o nível de sensibilidade, maior é o score do WAF que ela aceita. Já as sensibilidades mais rígidas, aceitam apenas requisições que somaram poucos indícios de ameaças.\n\n---\n\n## WAF Tuning\n\n**WAF Tuning** é uma ferramenta analítica, que mostra os IPs bloqueados por possível tentativa de ataque. Na aba **Tuning**, é onde você pode flexibilizar o funcionamento do WAF. Os IPs bloqueados são exibidos de forma agrupada na tabela **Filter Possible Attacks** e é possível filtrar por Domínio, Data, Network Lists, IP e país.\n\nNos filtros abaixo de **Filter Possible Attacks**:\n\n1. Informe o domínio (obrigatório), a data, quais Network Lists prefere utilizar, quais IPs está investigando e o país de origem da requisição. \n2. Clique no botão **Apply filter**.\n\n> Para ver os IPs bloqueados pelo WAF é necessário informar pelo menos o domínio (ou os domínios) da sua aplicação. Os outros campos são opcionais, mas permitem uma seleção mais detalhada.\n\nAo clicar no botão **Apply filter**, uma lista de **Possible Attacks** será exibida. Essa lista conta com os campos **Rule ID**, **Description**, **Hits**, **IPs**, **Countries**, **Top 10 IPs Address** e **Top 10 Countries**.\n\nPara mais informações sobre esses possíveis ataques, consulte a documentação de [Custom Allowed Rules do WAF](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-firewall/web-application-firewall/allowed-rules-customizadas/).\n\nCaso note tráfego interno, testes ou até mesmo falsos positivos barrados pelo WAF, é possível criar uma **Allowed Rule** para esses IPs e comportamentos barrados. Para isso\n\n1. Clique na linha que representa a regra barrada, para acessar mais detalhes como **Field** e **Top 10 Paths**.\n2. Selecione o *checkbox* das regras que você deseja permitir.\n3. Clique **Allow Rules**. Um modal aparecerá pedindo para confirmar a ação e descrever o motivo.\n\n> **Dica**: é importante lembrar que, ao descrever o motivo, ele irá sobrescrever a descrição do Rule ID. Por isso, se deseja manter a descrição, junto com o motivo, copie a descrição e cole junto com o motivo.\n\n---\n\n## Allowed Rules\n\nAs *Allowed Rules* são compostas pelos campos:\n\n- **Rule ID**: ID numérico único de cada regra do WAF.\n- **Rule Descriptions**: uma descrição textual do que a regra faz.\n- **URI**: Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) é o *path* (caminho) que vai após o domínio e a porta na URL. Exemplo: `/documentation/products/edge-firewall/`\n- Path: quando especificado, restringe a aplicação da Match Zone somente ao path definido. O path delimita o escopo de atuação da regra.\n- **Match Zone**: partes ou campos da requisição que serão comparados com o `match pattern`. Pode ser:\n    - Path: o `match pattern` será comparado com o *path* da requisição. \n    - Query String: o `match pattern` será comparado com a *query string*, também chamada de *GET arguments*. \n    - Request Header: o `match pattern` será comparado com os cabeçalhos HTTP da requisição. \n    - Request Body: o `match pattern` será comparado com o body de um POST, também chamado de *POST arguments*. \n    - File Name (Multipart Body): o `match pattern` será comparado com o nome de arquivos em *multipart POSTs*. \n    - Raw Body: o `match pattern` será comparado com o body não interpretado de uma requisição, também chamado de *unparsed body*.\n- **Last Editor**: nome do último usuário a modificar essa *Allowed Rule*.\n- **Last Modified**: data da última modificação.\n- **Active**: status da *Allowed Rule*.\n\nCaso deseje apagar uma regra criada:\n\n1. Acesse a aba **Allowed Rules**.\n2. Clique no ícone da lixeira.\n3. Digite *delete* na janela de confirmação, em seguida clique no botão **Delete**.\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"315px\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LceEdXEJoUU\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n",

Gere uma credencial para executar as ações;\n\n   > Para gerar a credencial necessária para autenticar seus edge nodes, siga os passos da [documentação de credenciais](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/credenciais/).\n2. Instale o agente **Edge Orchestrator** nos seus dispositivos;\n3. Autentique o dispositivo depois da instalação.\n\nPara iniciar o processo de instalação do **Edge Node**, você deve fazer o download do binário de instalação do **Edge Orchestrator** de sua preferência.\n\n> **Nota**: Os comandos executados no agente *edge-orchestrator* devem ser executados com *privilégios de usuário root*.\n\nO usuário root é aquele que tem acesso irrestrito a todos os componentes do sistema, tanto arquivos quanto processos. Caso você não tenha esses privilégios pode haver falha na instalação ao tentar gerenciar alguns requisitos do sistema operacional que exigem esses privilégios.\n\nConfira a listagem de plataformas compatíveis com o Azion Edge Node e faça o download:\n\n| Sistema Operacional | Arquitetura | Arquivo |\n| :--- | :---: | --- |\n| FreeBSD | x86_64 | [edge-orchestrator](https://downloads.azion.com/freebsd/x86_64/edge-orchestrator) |\n| FreeBSD | ARM64 | [edge-orchestrator](https://downloads.azion.com/freebsd/arm64/edge-orchestrator) |\n| Linux | x86_32 | [edge-orchestrator](https://downloads.azion.com/linux/x86_32/edge-orchestrator) |\n| Linux | x86_64 | [edge-orchestrator](https://downloads.azion.com/linux/x86_64/edge-orchestrator) |\n| Linux | ARM32 | [edge-orchestrator](https://downloads.azion.com/linux/arm32/edge-orchestrator) |\n| Linux | ARM64 | [edge-orchestrator](https://downloads.azion.com/linux/arm64/edge-orchestrator) |\n| MacOS | x86_64 | [edge-orchestrator](https://downloads.azion.com/darwin/x86_64/edge-orchestrator) |\n\nComo alternativa, você pode fazer download via linha de comando. No exemplo, o link para download é referente ao agente Linux/x86_64. Caso queira fazer o download de outra versão, basta alterar a URL para o sistema operacional ou a arquitetura desejada:\n\n`curl -O http://downloads.azion.com/linux/x86_64/edge-orchestrator`\n\nApós o download, você deve seguir os passos abaixo, para que seu dispositivo instale o agente do **Edge Orchestrator**:\n\n1. Instale o agente do **Edge Orchestrator**:<br />\n   `chmod +x edge-orchestrator`<br />\n   `./edge-orchestrator install`\n2. Informe o **token** para o agente do Edge Orchestrator;\n3. Confirme as etapas seguintes;\n4. Inicialize o agente do **Edge Orchestrator** após finalizar a instalação:<br />\n   `edge-orchestrator start`<br />\n   **Observação:** caso o seu sistema operacional não disponha de um gerenciador de serviços (systemd, por exemplo), você deve executar como foreground: <br/>`edge-orchestrator start --foreground`\n\n   > Os _logs_ de execução do agente do Edge Orchestrator são armazenados em <br />`/var/log/azion/edge-orchestrator.log`\n\n---\n\n## Visualização de seus nodes\n\nSempre que o código de instalação for executado em algum dispositivo, seguido da autenticação via token, os edge nodes serão listados no [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/).\n\nPara visualizar a lista de edge nodes criados para a sua conta, siga os passos abaixo:\n\n1. Acesse o [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/);\n2. Acesse o item **Edge Orchestration** no menu superior esquerdo e selecione a página **Edge Node**.\n\n> Os itens listados podem ser verificados validando a coluna de HashId, pois ela contém o hash utilizado para a criação e autenticação do edge node.\n\n---\n\n## Autorização\nPara começar a orquestração dos seus Edge Nodes, eles devem ser autorizados. Para autorizá-los, os seguintes passos devem ser executados:\n\n1. Abra a lista de **Edge Nodes** no [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/).\n2. Clique no **ícone** (chave) e aceite a janela de confirmação.\n\n> Após a autorização, o **Edge Node** pode demorar até *10 segundos* para que a orquestração dos serviços seja iniciada.\n\nVocê também pode autorizar todos os seus edge nodes que desejar de uma única vez. Para fazer uso dessa opção, siga os passos abaixo:\n\n1. Abra a lista de **Edge Nodes** no [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/);\n2. Selecione os itens que você quer autorizar ou, se preferir, selecione todos os ícones clicando na primeira caixa de seleção à esquerda;\n3. No canto superior direito, clique no botão **Actions** e selecione **Authorize**;\n4. Uma mensagem confirmando a sua ação será mostrada, clique no botão **Confirm** para salvar sua seleção;\n5. Você verá a seguinte mensagem de confirmação: *\"X nodes were successfully authorized!\"*\n\n---\n\n## Serviços\n\nPara provisionar os serviços cadastrados na sua biblioteca, siga os passos abaixo:\n\n1. Abra a lista de **Edge Nodes** no [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/);\n2. Selecione o **Edge Node** que deseja configurar;\n3. Acesse a aba **Services** e clicar no botão **Add Service**;\n4. Vincule o serviço desejado e, caso necessário, configure as variáveis necessárias para a sua execução.\n\n> Os serviços disponíveis para orquestração via Edge Node devem estar cadastrados em **Edge Libraries** > **Edge Services** e marcados como ativos.\n\nApós a provisão do serviço, o Edge Node inicia a orquestração seguindo a prioridade dos recursos. Você pode acompanhar o processo de instalação dos serviços via logs no agente do Edge Orchestrator.\n\n> Os logs de instalação do serviço são armazenados em <br/>`/var/log/azion/edge-services.log`\n\n---\n\n## Comandos e opções do agente\n\nO agente do Edge Orchestrator apresenta alguns comandos e opções para facilitar o seu uso.\n\n|  | Descrição |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| --debug ou -d | Define os logs do agente como modo depuração. |\n| --help ou -h | Ajuda sobre os comandos que podem ser executados no agente. |\n| install | Instala o agente no device do cliente; copia o binário para o local de instalação; adiciona o agente do Edge Orchestrator ao gerenciador de serviços do device (caso exista); e configura as credenciais para autenticação do Edge Node. |\n| start \\[--foreground\\] | Inicializa o agente do Edge Orchestrator por meio do gerenciador de serviços do device.<br /> Observação: a opção foreground é utilizada para execução em primeiro plano. |\n| start \\[-g OR --join-group\\] | Ao utilizar estas flags seguidas por uma lista de nomes de grupos separada por vírgulas, você pode registrar seu edge-node com o(s) grupo(s) especificado(s) através da linha de comando ao iniciá-lo pela primeira vez. <br/> Exemplo: sudo edge-orchestrator start -g GROUP1,GROUP2,GROUP3 --foreground |\n| start \\[-n OR --set-name\\] | Ao utilizar estas flags seguidas do nome desejado, você pode especificar o nome de seu novo node através da linha de comando ao iniciá-lo pela primeira vez . Caso não sejam usadas, o hostname é usado como valor padrão. <br/> Exemplo: sudo edge-orchestrator start -n Edgenodename --foreground |\n| status | Obtém o status de execução do agente do Edge Orchestrator. |\n| stop | Para a execução do agente do Edge Orchestrator por meio do gerenciador de serviços do device. |\n| uninstall | Desinstala o agente do device do cliente. Remove o binário do local de instalação; remove o agente do Edge Orchestrator do gerenciador de serviços do device (caso exista). <br />Observação: as credenciais de autenticação permanecem no device e podem ser removidas via painel de controle da Azion. |\n| --version ou -v | Exibe a versão do agente instalado. |\n\nComo observado na tabela acima podemos ter as seguintes start-flags:\n\n`--foreground`\n`--join-group` <groupname> or `-g` </groupname>\n`--set-name` <nodename> or `-n` </nodename>\n\n> As start-flags são opcionais.\n\n---\n\n## Watcher\n\nPara evitar qualquer mudança de configuração nos recursos administrados pelo Orchestrator, o agente oferece um recurso chamado **Watcher**.\n\nÉ um recurso não gerenciável de nosso agente que restaura qualquer arquivo adulterado, ou seja, consiste em um grupo de *workers* que verifica periodicamente todos os arquivos provisionados procurando por qualquer desvio – modificação ou remoção – com base no último manifesto aplicado, restaurando o estado desejado, se necessário.\n\nVocê pode verificar qualquer ação feita pelo **Watcher** consultando o *logfile* `/var/log/azion/edge-orchestrator.log`.\n\n\n```\n    # /var/log/azion/edge-orchestrator.log\n    {\"level\":\"info\",\"time\":\"2021-09-22T17:31:16Z\",\"message\":\"finished applying resources for version 3128\"}\n    {\"level\":\"info\",\"time\":\"2021-09-22T17:31:16Z\",\"message\":\"apply manifest 3128 finished\"}\n    {\"level\":\"info\",\"time\":\"2021-09-22T17:31:16Z\",\"message\":\"watcher: started with period of 60 seconds using 5 workers\"}\n    {\"level\":\"info\",\"time\":\"2021-09-22T17:32:16Z\",\"message\":\"watcher: dispatching workers\"}\n    {\"level\":\"info\",\"time\":\"2021-09-22T17:32:16Z\",\"message\":\"watcher: dispatched 5 workers\"}\n    {\"level\":\"info\",\"time\":\"2021-09-22T17:32:16Z\",\"message\":\"watcher: workers finished\"}\n    {\"level\":\"info\",\"time\":\"2021-09-22T17:32:16Z\",\"message\":\"watcher: checked 19576 artifacts, 0 drifted from manifest.\"}\n```\n\n",

    "body": "\n\nO **Azion Edge Services** é um módulo do produto **Edge Orchestrator** que permite o gerenciamento de serviços orquestrados em seus próprios nodes, habilitando o cadastro de recursos e demais configurações via [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/) e a criação e customização de serviços para que possam ser orquestrados nos Edge Nodes definidos.\n\nConfigure os gatilhos de instalação, desinstalação e recarregamento e defina as dependências entre os recursos necessários para a execução de seu serviço na sua rede Edge.\n\n---\n\n## Como funciona\n\nAo utilizar a Azion como sua plataforma de Edge, você pode criar e customizar serviços para serem executados na sua rede Edge privada e híbrida. O Azion Edge Services funciona por meio de gatilhos para instalação, desinstalação e recarregamento, com definição das dependências entre os recursos, e implementa nativamente um conjunto de funcionalidades da Azion, como Edge Applications, Edge Firewalls e Edge Functions, utilizando como base a tecnologia de Azion Cells. \n\nDessa forma, permite construir Edge Applications para uma grande variedade de casos de uso, que variam desde uma CDN de alta escala e qualidade até a hospedagem de aplicações web, aplicações de AI, VR e muitas outras. Para isso, *ative* o **Azion Cells** e defina os **Edge Nodes** que devem receber determinadas aplicações, tudo controlado pelo painel de controle da Azion ou APIs, em uma interface centralizada e com diferentes controles de acesso.\n\n### Resources\n\nPara poder orquestrar serviços em seu dispositivo, você precisa configurar todos os **resources** (recursos) necessários para instalar, desinstalar e recarregar seus serviços.\n\nUm recurso do tipo **Text** indica que o conteúdo será copiado como texto simples para o dispositivo. Esses tipos de recursos normalmente são usados para arquivos de configuração. \n\nUm recurso do tipo **Shell Script** indica que o recurso será instalado e executado conforme o **trigger** selecionado. O agente do Edge Orchestrator utiliza o *sh-bang* informado no cabeçalho do conteúdo para a execução do script; na ausência de um, é utilizado o **shell** compatível com o padrão POSIX no dispositivo (*/bin/sh*). \n\nAmbos os tipos de recursos são compatíveis com o uso de **variables** (variáveis) e **facts** (fatos), desde que a etiqueta ``{{ VARNAME }}`` ou ``{{ FACT_NAME }}`` esteja incluída.\n\nTodos os recursos são executados usando o *Path* referido no registro. O campo *Path* refere-se ao caminho absoluto do diretório. Caminhos relativos não serão aceitos e não são suportados.\n\n**Nota:** Há um problema conhecido quando se usa a sintaxe `{#`. Se você usar `{#` e não usar` #}` como fechamento, o resource não será processado e não será provisionado nos edges. Se você usar `{#` e depois usar `#}`, o conteúdo dentro do bloco é considerado um comentário. Neste caso, o arquivo é processado e provisionado, mas sem o conteúdo dentro do comentário. Para provisionar um resource com `{# meu conteúdo #}` você deve usar o seguinte padrão: ``{{'{# meu conteúdo #}'}}``. Nossa equipe de engenharia está ciente do problema e está trabalhando para resolvê-lo.\n\n### Variables\n\nAs variáveis são valores dinâmicos que afetam os Edge Services que serão orquestrados e executados em Edge Nodes. Em outras palavras, é possível orquestrar e executar o mesmo serviço, em dispositivos diferentes, com valores diferentes para as configurações, como configurar um serviço na porta 3306 em um dispositivo, e na porta 3307 em outro dispositivo.\n\nVariáveis  podem ser usadas no conteúdo do recurso se a *tag* ``{{VARNAME }}`` for utilizada. Por exemplo:<br /> ``port = {{ PORT_HTTP }}``\n\nHá algumas variáveis especiais pré-definidas que, como fatos, não podem ser sobrescritas. Veja a lista na tabela abaixo:\n\n| Variável               | Descrição                                                    | Valor  | Observação                                                   |\n| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| **CHANGESET_RM_PATH**  | Contém um *path* para um arquivo que contém uma lista de *paths* de todos os arquivos **removidos** ou **modificados** no manifesto atual. | STRING | Está disponível somente enquanto o manifesto está sendo aplicado. Cada linha tem um único *path*. |\n| **CHANGESET_ADD_PATH** | Contém um *path* para um arquivo que contém uma lista de *paths* de todos os arquivos **adicionados** ou **modificados** no manifesto atual. | STRING | Está disponível somente enquanto o manifesto está sendo aplicado. Cada linha tem um único *path*. |\n\n### Facts\n\nEm complemento às variáveis definidas, você também pode utilizar **Facts** que são informações técnicas disponíveis sobre seu node, tais como arquitetura, versão do cliente, sistema operacional e versão do sistema operacional. Você pode usá-los, por exemplo, se você estiver configurando múltiplos nodes. \n\nEsses valores não podem ser sobrescritos e podem ser usados em **resources** usando a tag  `{{ FACT_NAME }}`. Por exemplo:<br />   `{{CLIENT_VERSION}}`.\n\n| Fact | Descrição | Valor | Observação |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| **CLIENT_VERSION** | Versão do Edge Orchestrator agent | MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH | Exemplo: 1.10.3, onde 1 é MAJOR, 10 é MINOR e 3 é PATCH. |\n| **ARCH** | Arquitetura do processador | ARM ou; AMD (x86), ambos com 32 ou 64 bits |  |\n| **OS_NAME** | Nome do Sistema Operacional | macOS; Linux; FreeBSD; OpenBSD; DragonFlyBSD; NetBSD ou; Solaris |  |\n| **OS_DISTRO** | Nome da distribuição do Sistema Operacional, apenas para sistemas baseados em Linux | NAME + RELEASE | NAME: Debian; Ubuntu; openSUSE; Mint Linux; Gentoo; Fedora; CentOS; Arch Linux ou; Kali Linux <br /> <br /> RELEASE: primeiramente obtendo via LSB Release, caso não exista busca em <br/>/etc/os-release o valor de VERSION_ID ou DISTRIB_RELEASE <br /> <br /> No caso dos demais Sistemas Operacionais o valor será sempre vazio. |\n| **OS_VERSION** | Versão do sistema operacional, apenas para MacOS | MAJOR.MINOR | Exemplo: 10.5. Para demais Sistemas Operacionais será sempre vazio |\n| **CPUS** | Número de CPUs disponíveis | INTEGER | Exemplo: 1, 2, 4. |\n| **RAM_SIZE** | Memória total do sistema | BYTES | Exemplo: 1048576 |\n\n### Triggers\n\nAo configurar resources do tipo **Shell Script**, é necessário definir quais serão os gatilhos (triggers) que farão com que o recurso seja executado.\n\nOs gatilhos são: *\"Install\"*, *\"Reload\"* e *\"Uninstall\"*, tendo cada uma deles uma função e ordem de execução:\n\n**1) Install:** é o primeiro a ser executado e deve ter em seu conteúdo o script necessário para a instalação do serviço.\n\n**2) Reload:** quando configurado, será executado ao final da instalação de todos os resources e também sempre que houver alteração nos vínculos entre Edge Service e Edge Node - por exemplo, uma alteração nos valores de variáveis.\n\n**3) Uninstall:** é executado toda vez que o vínculo entre Edge Services e Edge Node é desfeito, ou seja, sempre que o serviço for apagado dos Edge Nodes nos quais está provisionado.\n\n### Vínculo ao Edge Node\n\nTodos os serviços cadastrados podem ser orquestrados e executados em um ou mais Edge Nodes existentes na sua rede privada.\n\nApenas os serviços ativos estarão disponíveis para orquestração no Edge Node; após o seu vínculo, você pode alterar o valor das variáveis existentes, apagar ou adicionar novos serviços ao dispositivo.\n\n---\n\n## Passo a Passo para criar um Edge Service\n\n1- Acesse o [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/);\n\n2- Acesse o item **Edge Libraries** no menu superior esquerdo e selecione a página **Edge Services**;\n\n3- Clique no botão **Add Service**. \n\n**Observação:** seu serviço será criado automaticamente. Você pode alterar o nome do serviço clicando em **My New Service**, na barra de identificação;\n\n4- Clique em **Add Resource** na listagem de **resources**;\n\n5- Configure os *resources* necessários para o seu serviço utilizando as *triggers*: \"*Install*\", \"*Reload*\" e \"*Uninstall*\";\n\n6- Opcional: caso tenha utilizado variáveis no conteúdo de um ou mais *resources*, defina os valores padrões para as variáveis na aba **Environment**. \n\n**Observação**: as variáveis devem seguir o padrão \"Variável = Valor\". \"Variável\" deve ter sido utilizada em conteúdos de resources já cadastrados.\n\n7- Ative o serviço e clique no botão **Save**.\n\nPronto! Agora seu serviço pode ser utilizado em um ou mais edge nodes.\n\n\n",

Gerencie e controle recursos Edge em tempo real e orquestre seus serviços de forma rápida e fácil para atender às suas necessidades.\n\n## Com o Edge Orchestrator, você pode\n\n- gerenciar e controlar recursos Edge em tempo real, o que inclui: provisionamento, atualização e gerenciamento de Edge Applications, Edge Firewalls, Edge Functions, Digital Certificates, Edge Nodes, Edge Services e serviços de terceiros via marketplace;\n- abrir e executar em vários tipos de arquiteturas, como microprocessadores como x86 e ARM, e em vários tipos de tamanho de equipamento, incluindo Raspberry PI, equipamentos de rede como switches e roteadores SD-WAN e também servidores corporativos, pois foi projetado para isso;\n- usar na maioria das arquiteturas de rede, incluindo redes locais e públicas, e também por trás de NATs;\n- simplificar a instalação e atualização do software, pois é compilado com todas as dependências do núcleo e de bibliotecas.\n\n---\n\n## Como funciona \n\nUm agente do Azion Edge Orchestrator é instalado nos edge nodes e fornece gerenciamento do node remoto criptografado de ponta a ponta a partir do [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/) – painel de controle da Azion – baseado em nuvem e API. Ele pode ser implementado usando duas estratégias diferentes:\n\n1. Instalação manual em cada edge node;\n2. Instalação automática junto com os sistemas operacionais como: uma distro linux ou imagem O.S do cliente ou fornecedor de hardware, por exemplo: um roteador SD-WAN, um switch de rede ou um servidor Linux. Os clientes podem usar um modo de registro automático, simplificando a implementação (por exemplo: novos locais de nodes ou escalonamento automático de nodes), atualização e gerenciamento de uma grande quantidade de edge nodes em escala.\n\nTodos os serviços vinculados aos edge nodes serão orquestrados e configurados a partir do momento em que o dispositivo é autorizado via painel de controle. A orquestração é feita de forma sequencial e respeita as dependências entre recursos e gatilhos necessários para a sua configuração.\n\n---\n\n## Módulos do Edge Orchestrator\n\nO Azion Edge Orchestrator oferece os seguintes módulos para que você possa construir sua rede Edge de alta performance, escalabilidade e segurança com muito mais simplicidade e livre de tarefas operacionais.\n\n### Edge Node\n\nO módulo **Edge Node** habilita a criação e gerenciamento dos dispositivos, bem como a integração com a Azion. É necessária a instalação do nosso agente para que possamos orquestrar suas configurações e garantir a comunicação segura entre os dispositivos e a Azion.\n\n[Saiba mais sobre Edge Node](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-orchestrator/edge-node/)\n\n---\n\n### Edge Services\n\nO módulo Edge Services habilita a criação de serviços próprios do cliente. Você pode levar seus serviços customizados para o Edge e garantir o gerenciamento e orquestração nos dispositivos via painel de controle.\n\n[Saiba mais sobre Edge Services](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-orchestrator/edge-services/)\n\n\n",

    "body": "\n**Edge Pulse** é um produto de [Observe](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/observe/) baseado na solução de mercado *Real User Monitoring (RUM)*. Com ele, você pode:\n\n- Coletar informações de navegação, disponibilidade, latência e banda.\n- Usar as informações coletadas para aprimorar a experiência do usuário final.\n- Proporcionar uma entrega de conteúdo eficiente.\n\nO Edge Pulse coleta dados de navegação dos usuários e métricas de disponibilidade, latência e taxa de transferência. Após inserir a **tag JavaScript do Edge Pulse**, o script:\n\n- Respeita o protocolo em uso (HTTP/HTTPS).\n- É totalmente assíncrono.\n- Não interfere no processo de carregamento nem na estrutura interna do conteúdo entregue.\n\nAlém disso, cada teste coleta métricas para apenas 3 endereços da edge network da Azion por vez, em um intervalo de 30 minutos por usuário. Assim, ele não carrega o cliente com repetições.\n\nOs testes são feitos de forma contínua e diversificada e cobrem todas as rotas possíveis que aquele usuário tem para chegar ao conteúdo. Após a coleta dos dados, os resultados são enviados para os servidores de processamento da Azion.\n\nVeja os [primeiros passos do Edge Pulse](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-pulse/primeiros-passos).\n\n---\n\n## O que é RUM\n\nReal User Monitoring (RUM) é um modelo de monitoramento que captura dados do usuário final com o objetivo de explicar como os seus usuários finais estão sendo impactados pela disponibilidade e eficiência da entrega do seu conteúdo.\n\nÉ uma forma passiva de monitorar o dispositivo do usuário final em ação. Ele oferece uma visão de um grande número de problemas, incluindo navegador front-end, banco de dados de back-end, questões relacionadas ao servidor e como os usuários finais experienciam tudo isso.\n\n---\n\n## Comportamento do Edge Pulse\n\nO **Edge Pulse** usa o [algoritmo UUID4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) para um melhor controle sobre os casos de sucessos e falhas.\n\nPara controlar e manipular dados do Edge Pulse, é utilizado o [armazenamento local do browser](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/API/Window/Window.localStorage).\n\nO rastreamento efetuado pelo Edge Pulse respeita as seguintes configurações do navegador do usuário:\n\n| Valor | Comportamento do Edge Pulse |\n| ----- | --------------------------- |\n| navigator.doNotTrack = '1' | Se o rastreamento nunca foi permitido e, por consequência, o Edge Pulse nunca usou o armazenamento local, então um código identificador será gerado para cada visita que o usuário efetuar no site.<br /> Caso esteja configurado como \"1\", mas já tenha sido rastreado, o identificador anterior é apagado e um novo é gerado. |\n| navigator.doNotTrack `<>` '1' | Quando o valor for diferente de \"1\", significa que o Edge Pulse irá rastrear. Sendo assim, o mesmo identificador será utilizado para cada visita de um usuário. |\n\n---\n\n## Edge Pulse JavaScript tag\n\nPara monitorar a página, é necessário inserir a **tag JavasScript do Edge Pulse** nela. Ela está disponível na página do Edge Pulse [no RTM](https://manager.azion.com/) através do botão **Copy to Clipboard**.\n\nVocê deve adicionar a **tag JavaScript** para iniciar a coleta das métricas. Essa ação é necessária para *cada página* que você deseja monitorar.\n\nA execução inicia após o navegador do usuário carregar a página. A tag pode ser publicada manualmente ou utilizando sistemas gerenciadores de tag disponíveis no mercado.\n\nExistem duas tags disponíveis:\n\n| Tag | Descrição |\n| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Default Tag | Coloque esta tag no HTML das páginas que você deseja coletar dados. Você deve colocá-la antes da tag de fechamento BODY. Este script espera até que o evento de carregamento seja concluído antes de baixar e executar o Cliente RUM, garantindo que o evento de carregamento não seja interrompido e não afete a experiência do usuário. |\n| Pre-loading Tag | Se você estiver usando configurações da Política de Segurança de Conteúdo impedindo o uso do JavaScript inline, coloque esta tag imediatamente antes da tag de fechamento BODY. Este script é executado antes que o load event seja disparado. |\n\n---\n\n## Dados coletados\n\nO **Edge Pulse** coleta as informações do Resolver utilizado para a resolução DNS, edge location testada e rede anônima do usuário. Você pode utilizar esses dados para tomar decisões relacionadas a roteamento de usuários.\n\nAlém disso, você pode explorar os dados de experiência de usuário e navegação através do⁠ [Real-Time Events](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/real-time-events/). Veja a [página de documentação](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/real-time-events/#DataSources) para obter uma lista com todas as variáveis disponíveis para o Edge Pulse.\n\n",

Com ele, seus domínios ficarão hospedados na infraestrutura da Azion, utilizando as mesmas soluções de performance e segurança construídas para os demais produtos Azion, combinando técnicas para otimização das requisições com proteção contra ataques Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS).\n\n***\n\n## O que é um Domain Name System (DNS)\n\n**Domain Name System (DNS)** é um sistema de resolução de nomes de domínios. Ele consegue resolver o nome em um endereço IP para que possa ser estabelecida uma conexão com o destino que fornecerá o conteúdo do site solicitado.\n\nEm outras palavras, o DNS resolve o endereço de IP do domínio que você deseja acessar em palavras para formar a URL que você conhece.\n\n> É o DNS que permite que você digite o nome de um domínio ao invés da sequência de números do endereço de IP. \n\n***\n\n## Como funciona o Intelligent DNS \n\nO Intelligent DNS é uma solução de DNS autoritativo e permite que clientes gerenciem seus domínios, zonas e registros através de uma interface amigável e intuitiva.\n\n> Você pode criar entradas do tipo ANAME, possibilitando a hospedagem e uso de _naked domains_ com outros produtos Azion.\n\n***\n\n## Configurar o Intelligent DNS\n\n***\n\n### Crie uma zona hospedada\n\n1. A partir do [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/), acesse o menu **Products Menu**, indicado pelo ícone `☰`. Selecione **SECURE** > **Intelligent DNS**. Você visualizará a interface principal onde poderá criar e administrar suas zonas.\n2. Clique no botão **Add Zone** e preencha os campos indicados a seguir:  \n   **Name for zone** (Nome da Zona): identificador da sua nova zona de domínio criada. Esse campo é livre. Você pode cadastrar essa informação da maneira que desejar.  \n   **Domain** (Domínio): nesse campo, você deve informar apenas o *Domain Name* em formato [FQDN](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/FQDN). Exemplo:`mydomain.com`.  \n   **Active**: essa flag indica se essa zona está ativa e deve ser respondida pelo **Intelligent DNS** ou não. Zonas desativadas são desconsideradas nas respostas do DNS.\n3. Clique no botão **Save** para finalizar.\n\n### Crie ou edite records relacionados a uma hosting zone\n\nUm record é usado para encontrar um endereço IP de computador conectado à internet a partir de um nome.\n\n1. A partir do [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/), acesse o menu **Products Menu**, indicado pelo ícone `☰` e selecione **Intelligent DNS**.\n2. Clique na zona que você pretende editar.\n\n   Você verá a interface principal onde você pode criar ou editar suas zonas. Ao fazer isso, você visualizará duas abas:\n\n   **Main Settings** – Nesta aba, você pode editar o nome da zona, o domínio principal, o status do serviço DNS e também terá acesso aos endereços dos servidores autorizados da Azion – *Nameservers* que responderão às consultas de sua zona.\n\n   **Records** – Nesta aba, você encontrará uma lista de todos os registros que fazem parte desta zona.\n3. Clique na aba **Records** para criar um novo record ou editar um já existente.\n4. Para criar um novo record, clique no botão **Add Record** e preencha os seguintes campos: Name, Type, Value, TTL (seconds) and Policy.

Como, por exemplo,  `manager` em [manager.azion.com](https://manager.azion.com/).\n\n#### Type\n\nTipo do registro. É o tipo de registro que está sendo adicionado, como, por exemplo, um registro do tipo A, AAAA, MX ou CNAME, dentre outros.  <br/>[(ver seção Tipos de entradas suportadas e as respectivas recomendações que o Intelligent DNS segue)](#tipos-de-entradas-suportadas)\n\nVeja as opções de type e suas respectivas descrições na tabela a seguir:\n\n| Type                                        | Descrição                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| A (IPv4 Address)                            | Registros de mapeamentos de endereços (A Records), também conhecidos como registros de host DNS, armazenam um nome de host e seu endereço IPv4 correspondente.                                                                                                                              |\n| AAAA (IPv6 Address)                         | Registro de endereço IP Versão 6 (Registro AAAA), armazena um nome de host e seu endereço IPv6 correspondente.                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ANAME (Maps a name to another name)         | O registro ALIAS é um tipo de registro virtual criado para fornecer comportamento semelhante ao CNAME em domínios apex.                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| CAA (Certification Authority Authorization) | Um registro CAA permite que um detentor de nome de domínio DNS especifique uma ou mais Autoridades de Certificação (CAs) autorizadas a emitir certificados para esse domínio ou subdomínio.                                                                                                 |\n| CNAME (Canonical Name Record)               | Pode ser usado para designar o nome de uma hostname a outro hostname. Quando um cliente DNS solicita um registro que contém um CNAME, que aponta para outro hostname, o processo de resolução DNS é repetido com o novo hostname.                                                           |\n| MX (Mail Exchange)                          | Mail exchanger record (Registro MX), especifica um servidor de email SMTP para o domínio, usado para rotear emails enviados para um servidor de email.                                                                                                                                      |\n| NS (Name Servers)                           | Os registros NS identificam os servidores DNS responsáveis (autorizados) por uma zona. Uma zona deve conter um registro NS para cada um de seus próprios servidores DNS (primário e secundário).                                                                                            |\n| PTR (Reverse DNS lookup)                    | Os registros PTR são usados para a pesquisa DNS reversa. Usando o endereço IP, você pode obter o domínio/nome do host associado. Deve existir um registro A para cada registro PTR. O uso de uma configuração DNS reversa para um servidor de email é uma boa solução.                     |\n| SRV (Location of server or service)         | Um registro de serviço (SRV record) é uma especificação de dados no DNS que define a localização. Por exemplo, o nome do host e o número da porta dos servidores para serviços especificados. Ele é definido na RFC 2782 e seu código de tipo é 33.                                         |\n| TXT (Text)                                  | Um registro TXT é um tipo de registro de recurso no DNS usado para fornecer a capacidade de associar texto arbitrário com um host ou outro nome, como informações legíveis por humanos sobre um servidor, rede, centro de dados ou outras informações contábeis.                            |\n\n#### Value\n\nÉ a resposta de DNS para o registro cadastrado, como por exemplo um endereço IPv4.\n\n#### TTL (seconds)\n\nEste é o momento em que uma resposta pode ser armazenada em cache em um resolver server. Time-to-live (TTL) é um valor em um pacote de protocolo de internet (IP) que informa a um roteador de rede se o pacote está na rede há muito tempo e deve ser descartado.\n\n#### Policy\n\nEle permite que você especifique qual política o Intelligent DNS deve considerar ao resolver solicitações respondidas por esta entrada de registro.\n\n> Você pode selecionar a **Simple Policy**, para usar a funcionalidade DNS padrão, ou a **Weighted Policy**, para especificar a quantidade de tráfego a ser enviada para cada Record.\n\nAo escolher a **Weighted** Policy, haverá mais dois campos a serem preenchidos, que são:\n\n**Weight:** você pode escolher um número entre 0 e 255 para especificar o peso para cada registro. Quando você escolhe 0, o **Intelligent DNS** deixa de usar este registro.\n\n**Description:** usados para diferenciar registros com o mesmo Nome e Tipo.\n\n> Clique no botão **Save** para finalizar a criação de seu registro.\n\nA partir desse momento, essas informações serão sincronizadas com o serviço de atendimento do Intelligent DNS. Suas configurações são salvas e distribuídas para a rede da Azion praticamente em tempo real.\n\nPronto! Seu domínio já está configurado e preparado para ser atendido pelo Intelligent DNS da Azion. Para verificar se tudo deu certo, execute alguns dos testes descritos na seção: [Testar minha zona](#testar-minha-zona).\n\n***\n\n### Record Policies\n\nEnquanto você está adicionando ou modificando um registro no Intelligent DNS, você pode encontrar o campo **\"Policy\"** – Política. Esse campo é ativado exatamente quando você está configurando registros do tipo A, AAAA, CNAME, ANAME ou MX. Ele permite que você escolha entre duas políticas para especificar como o Intelligent DNS deve lidar com as solicitações que respondem por este registro.\n\n#### Simple Policy\n\nAo selecionar uma política simples (Simple Policy), o Intelligent DNS usa o comportamento padrão dos registros DNS, roteando todo o tráfego para os endereços especificados no campo **Value**.\n\n#### Weighted Policy\n\nAo selecionar a política ponderada (Weighted Policy), o Intelligent DNS permite criar vários registros com o mesmo `Name` e `Type`, permitindo especificar um `Weight`, que define quanto tráfego deve ser roteado para cada registro. Esta configuração permite que você realize balanceamento de carga de suas aplicações ou mesmo teste gradualmente novas configurações.\n\nAo selecionar a Weighted Policy, diferentes opções de campos são exibidas:\n\n| Campo                    | Descrição                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Weight<br />*obrigatório   | Você precisa especificar um valor de peso (Weight), entre 0 e 255. Valores mais altos aumentam as chances de um registro específico ser usado. Definir 0 desativa o registro. |\n| Description<br />*opcional | Você pode adicionar uma descrição de até 45 caracteres para distinguir entre registros com o mesmo Name e Type. Exemplo: Florida Load Balancer                                |\n\nDado um conjunto de Registros Ponderados (Weighted Records) com o mesmo *Name* e *Type*, as chances de um registro específico ser escolhido pelo Intelligent DNS é definido pela seguinte fórmula:\n\n`Weight of the record / Sum of all Weights`\n\n***\n\n## Tipos de entradas suportadas e as respectivas recomendações que o Intelligent DNS segue\n\nPara prover a criação de registros, o **Intelligent DNS** implementa os seguintes tipos de entradas DNS:\n\n| Type  | Referência                |\n|-------|---------------------------|\n| A     | RFC1035                   |\n| AAAA  | RFC3596                   |\n| ANAME | draft-ietf-dnsop-aname-04 |\n| CAA   | RFC8659                   |\n| CNAME | RFC1035                   |\n| MX    | RFC1035 e RFC7505         |\n| NS    | RFC2782                   |\n| PTR   | RFC1035                   |\n| SRV   | RFC2782                   |\n| TXT   | RFC1035 e RFC1464         |\n\n## Regras de preenchimento de valores - _Value_\n\n| Type | Regra de restrição | Exemplo |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| A | Deve seguir o formato IPv4 <br /><br /> Máximo de 10 endereços IP (um por linha)<br /><br /> Somente endereços IPv4 válidos serão aceitos como resposta | Nome da Zona: azion.com<br /><br /> Nome do Registro: @ (Ou em branco)<br /><br /> Valor da resposta:<br /><br /> 192.209.210.67<br /><br /> 198.199.105.93 |\n| AAAA | Deve seguir o formato IPv6  <br /> <br />Máximo de 10 endereços IP (um por linha)<br /><br /> Somente endereços IPv6 válidos serão aceitos como resposta | Nome da Zona: azion.com<br /><br /> Nome do Registro: www<br /><br /> Valor da resposta:<br /><br /> 2800:3f0:4001:815::2004 |\n| ANAME | Deve ser no formato FQDN<br /><br /> Apenas um domínio para cada registro do tipo ANAME<br /><br /> Somente domínios abaixo de 'azioncdn.net', 'azionedge.net' e 'azionedge.com' são aceitos como valor.<br /> Pode coexistir com registros de mesmo nome mas de tipos diferentes (MX, TXT etc.) | Nome da Zona: azion.com<br /><br /> Nome do Registro: @<br /><br /> Valor da resposta:<br /><br /> 32082s.ha.azioncdn.net |\n| CAA | Deve seguir o formato \\[FLAG\\] \\[TAG\\] \"\\[VALUE\\]\" no valor da resposta.

Utilizar url (http/https) ou mailto, por exemplo: \"mailto:email@domain.com\", \"https://url\" e \"http://url\".<br /><br />Value:<br />O value deve estar sempre entre aspas duplas, exemplo \"ca.example.com\" e o seu conteúdo varia de acordo com a tag utilizada. <br />Issue: url ou uma sequência, por exemplo: \"ca.example.net; account=123456\" ou \"ca.example.com\"<br />Issuewild: deve ser utilizado um domínio com wildcard, por exemplo: \"*.example.com\"<br />iodef: uma url callback ou um endereço de e-mail, por exemplo: \"mailto:email@domain\", \"https://example.com/callback\" e \"http://example.com/callback\".<br /><br /> |\n| CNAME | Deve respeitar o formato FQDN <br/><br/> Apontar somente para outro nome de domínio, nunca para um endereço IP<br/><br/> Não pode ser colocado no nível do domínio raiz.<br/><br/> Permitido apenas um domínio para cada registro do tipo CNAME<br/><br/> Um nome de host definido em um registro CNAME não deve ter outros registros de recursos de outros tipos (MX, A, etc.)<br/><br/> Os registros CNAME podem apontar para outros registros CNAME, mas isso não é considerado uma boa prática, pois é ineficiente<br/><br/>Caso um registro CNAME estiver apontando para um registro da mesma zona, o Intelligent DNS responderá todos eles em apenas um consulta |  |\n| MX | Deve seguir o formato \\[PRIORITY\\] \\[ADDRESS\\]<br /><br />Máximo de 10 endereços IP (um por linha) | Nome da Zona: azion.com<br /><br /> Nome do Registro: mail<br /><br /> Valor(es) da resposta:<br /><br /> 10 mailserver.example.com<br /><br /> 20 mailserver2.example.com |\n| NS | Deve respeitar o formato FQDN  ou endereço de ip<br /><br />Máximo de 10 endereços (um por linha)<br /><br />Um NS não pode ser configurado para o domínio principal da zona (naked domain)<br /><br />Deve apontar para os servidores que detém autoridade sobre aquele registro | Nome da Zona: azion.com<br /><br /> Nome do Registro: ns<br /><br /> Valores de resposta:<br /><br /> ns1.aziondns.net<br /><br /> ns2.aziondns.net |\n| PTR | Zonas reversas vinculadas a endereços IPv6 seguem outras regras. Veja aqui mais informações. | 1- Crie uma nova zona, colocando a seguinte informação como DOMAIN:<br /> 0.168.192.in-addr.arpa<br /><br /> 2 - Após a criação dessa zona, você deve criar um registro associado a ela do tipo PTR, com a seguinte configuração:<br /><br /> Nome do Registro: 1<br /><br /> Valor da resposta: www.exemplo.com |\n| SRV | Deve obedecer o seguinte formato no nome do registro: '_service._protocol.name'. Exemplo: \"_ldap._tcp.azionsrv\"<br /><br /> Os valores de resposta devem seguir, obrigatoriamente, o formato \\[prioridade\\] \\[peso\\] \\[porta\\] \\[destino\\]<br /><br /> Máximo de 10 respostas por registro (uma por linha)<br /><br /> Deve apontar para o nome do host que possua um registro A ou AAAA.<br /><br /> Obs: É você quem deve ter essa atenção, pois o Intelligent DNS não realiza essa validação automaticamente | Nome da Zona: azion.com<br /><br /> Nome do Registro: _ldap._tcp.azionsrv<br /><br /> Valores de resposta:<br /><br /> 0 60 5060 bigbox.example.com |\n| TXT | Limite total de 1000 caracteres<br /><br />Textos separados por ENTER são considerados respostas diferentes para o Intelligent DNS | Nome da Zona: azion.com<br /><br /> Nome do Registro: txt<br /><br /> Valores de resposta:<br /><br />This domain name is reserved for use in documentation<br /><br /> \"printer=lpr5\"<br /><br /> \"favorite drink=orange juice\" |\n\nÉ possível configurar seu domínio, como *www.azion.com*, para que ele seja usado como um *naked domain*, como *Azion.com*, sem o \"www\". Há duas opções para realizar essa configuração:\n\n* Criar uma entrada A-type apontando para seu webserver. Assim, ele fará o redirecionamento para a Azion. Essa opção pode impactar o ranking Google.\n* Criar uma entrada ANAME no seu DNS e apontá-la para a Azion. Se você utiliza um serviço de DNS fora da Azion ou um domínio que aponta para outra plataforma, essa opção pode não ser suportada.\n\n## Utilizar wildcards\n\nUm registro curinga é um registro que responde a solicitações de DNS para domínios que você ainda não definiu. Você pode criá-los para qualquer tipo, inserindo um asterisco (*) no nome do registro. Por exemplo, imagine que você tenha a seguinte configuração para uma zona cujo domínio é *example.com*:\n\n| Name       | Type | Value                                               |\n|------------|----- |-----------------------------------------------------|\n| www        | A    | 192.168.0.1<br /><br /> 192.168.0.2<br /><br /> 192.168.0.3 |\n| *          | A    | 1.1.1.1                                             |\n| *.wildcard | A    | 2.2.2.2                                             |\n\n#### Isso significa que:\n\n* Se a consulta for realizada por *www.example.com*, a resposta será composta por 3 endereços IP: 192.168.0.1, 192.168.0.2 e 192.168.0 Nota: ele **não é** um wildcard, mas tem prioridade na resposta porque encontrou corretamente o registro consultado.\n* Se a consulta for realizada por *ghost.example.com*, a resposta será efetuada de acordo com o wildcard encontrado. Ou seja, responderá: 1.1.1.1.\n* Se a consulta for realizada por *another.wildcard.example.com*, a resposta será efetuada de acordo com o wildcard encontrado para essa construção Ou seja, responderá: 2.2.2.2.\n* Se a consulta for realizada por *wrong.record.example.com*, a resposta não terá nenhum valor, pois não existe nenhuma correspondência a essa estrutura consultada.\n\n### Restrições na construção de _wildcards_\n\nSomente será considerado um _wildcard_, o asterisco mais à esquerda seguido, obrigatoriamente, por um ponto. Todos os demais asteriscos, se existirem, serão considerados como caracteres válidos.\n\n> Asteriscos localizados mais à esquerda que não estiverem sendo seguidos por um ponto não serão considerados wildcards.\n\nNão é permitido a utilização de caracteres curingas em registros do tipo SRV, pois ele segue uma norma de formatação em seu nome.\n\n***\n\n## Testar minha zona\n\nSe você já efetuou as configurações desejadas no **Intelligent DNS** e agora deseja verificar se ele está respondendo adequadamente suas informações, você pode testá-lo utilizando as seguintes ferramentas:\n\n### DIG\n\nO *Domain Information Groper (DIG)* é uma ferramenta de linha de comando de administração de rede para consultar o DNS. A ferramenta é útil para solucionar problemas de rede e para fins educacionais, podendo operar com base na opção da linha de comando e nos argumentos do sinalizador ou no modo em lote, lendo solicitações de um arquivo do sistema operacional. Quando um servidor de nomes específico não é informado na chamada de comando, ele usa o resolvedor padrão do sistema operacional, geralmente configurado no arquivo `resolv.conf`. Sem argumentos, ele consulta a zona raiz do DNS.\n\nÉ um componente do pacote de software para servidores de nomes de domínio *BIND* e, na prática, substitui ferramentas antigas, como \"*nslookup*\" e o \"*host*\". No entanto, as ferramentas mais antigas ainda são usadas de maneira complementar.\n\nPara você testar o **Intelligent DNS**, deve utilizar um dos *nameservers* listados na aba *Main Settings* de sua zona cadastrada na Azion.\n\nPor exemplo, imagine que você tenha a seguinte configuração:\n\n| Name | Type | Value                                               | TTL  |\n|------|----- |-----------------------------------------------------|------|\n| www  | A    | 192.168.0.1<br /><br /> 192.168.0.2<br /><br /> 192.168.0.3 | 3600 |\n\nPara verificar como o **Intelligent DNS** responderá por uma consulta ao tipo \"A\" cadastrado para o registro *www*, digite o seguinte comando:\n\n`dig A www.example.com @ns1.aziondns.net`\n\nEssa será a resposta a essa consulta:\n\n`; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> A www.example.com @ns1.aziondns.net ;; global options: +cmd ;; Got answer: ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 46329 ;; flags: qr aa rd; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 3, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1 ;; WARNING: recursion requested but not available ;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION: ; EDNS: version: 0, flags:; udp: 4096 ;; QUESTION SECTION: ;www.example.com.

Quando nenhum argumento ou opção é fornecido, o host imprime um breve resumo dos argumentos e opções da linha de comando.\n\nPor exemplo, imagine que você tenha a seguinte configuração:\n\n| Name | Type | Value                                               | TTL  |\n|------|----- |-----------------------------------------------------|------|\n| www  | A    | 192.168.0.1<br /><br /> 192.168.0.2<br /><br /> 192.168.0.3 | 3600 |\n\nPara verificar como o **Intelligent DNS** responderá por uma consulta ao tipo \"A\" cadastrado para o registro *www*, digite o seguinte comando:\n\n`host www.example.com ns1.aziondns.net`\n\nEssa será a resposta a essa consulta:\n\n`Using domain server: Name: ns1.aziondns.net Address: 179.191.160.2#53 Aliases: www.example.com has address 192.168.0.1 www.example.com has address 192.168.0.2 www.example.com has address 192.168.0.3`\n\n### NSLOOKUP\n\n*Nslookup* é uma ferramenta, comum ao Windows e ao Linux, utilizada para se obter informações sobre registros de DNS de um determinado domínio, host ou IP.\n\nPor exemplo, imagine que você tenha a seguinte configuração:\n\n| Name | Type | Value                                               | TTL  |\n|------|----- |-----------------------------------------------------|------|\n| www  | A    | 192.168.0.1<br /><br /> 192.168.0.2<br /><br /> 192.168.0.3 | 3600 |\n\nPara verificar como o **Intelligent DNS** responderá por uma consulta ao tipo \"A\" cadastrado para o registro \"*www*\", digite o seguinte comando:\n\n`nslookup www.example.com ns1.aziondns.net`\n\nEssa será a resposta a essa consulta:\n\n`Server: ns1.aziondns.net Address: 179.191.160.2#53 Name: www.example.com Address: 192.168.0.1 Name: www.example.com Address: 192.168.0.2 Name: www.example.com Address: 192.168.0.3`\n\n***\n\n## Configurar o Intelligent DNS para responder pelos seus domínios\n\nPara que o **Intelligent DNS** passe a responder como autoridade sobre suas zonas, você deve efetuar o apontamento no seu DNS de registro. Por exemplo: `registro.br`, `GoDaddy`, `AWS`.\n\nPara efetuar o apontamento no seu DNS de registro, utilize um dos *nameservers* listados na aba *Main Settings* de suas zonas cadastradas na Azion.\n\n> Importante verificar se todos os seus registros estão devidamente cadastrados e testados no Intelligent DNS antes de efetuar esse apontamento. Caso contrário, você correrá o risco de ter indisponibilidade do seu serviço.\n\n***\n\n## Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC)\n\nO **Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC)** é um recurso do Domain Name System (DNS) que autentica respostas a pesquisas de nome de domínio. Ele não fornece proteções de privacidade para essas pesquisas, mas impede que invasores manipulem ou envenenem as respostas às solicitações de DNS.\n\n> A plataforma da Azion é compatível com DNSSEC. Saiba como [hospedar uma zona de DNSSEC com a Azion](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/intelligent-dns/compatibilidade-dnssec/).\n\n## Configurar redirecionamento em massa para migração de domínios\n\nO **Edge Function Massive Redirect** é uma solução serverless da Azion para o processamento de muitos redirecionamentos simultâneos. Ele pode ser empregado onde houver necessidade de alterar um número significativo de endereços como, por exemplo, nas migrações de domínios.\n\nPara configurar o redirecionamento em massa para a migração de domínios, acesse a documentação [Redirecionamento em massa para migração de domínios](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/massive-redirect/).  \n\n\n",

Indica como foi feita a navegação para esta página/script (Ex: navegação, recarregamento). |\n| $typebackforward | Tipo de navegação através do histórico da sessão. |\n| $typenavigate | Retorna o tipo da última navegação sem redirecionamento, por exemplo: clicando em um link, digitando a URL na barra de endereço ou enviando um formulário. |\n| $typereload | Tipo de navegação para a operação de recarregamento, ou seja, quando a página foi recarregada. |\n| $typereserved | Qualquer tipo de navegação não definida por aqueles mencionados anteriormente (tipoNavigate, tipoReload). |\n| $userAgent | Retorna o User Agent do navegador. |\n| $version | A versão do Azion Log utilizada. |\n\n### **WAF**\n\nCaso tenha contratado o produto [Web Application Firewall](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/edge-firewall/web-application-firewall/), o data source WAF Events apresentará as requisições analisadas pelo WAF para permitir que você mapeie o score atribuído a requisição, as regras de WAF que deram match, o motivo do bloqueio e muito mais.\n\n| Variável | Descrição |\n| --- | --- |\n| $attack_family | Informa as famílias de ataques, categorias onde nosso Web Application Firewall identifica o ataque e classifica-o conforme o OWASP Top 10. |\n| $blocked | Informa se o WAF bloqueou ou não a ação; 0 quando não bloqueado e 1 quando bloqueado Quando em \"Learning Mode\", não será bloqueado, independente do retorno. |\n| $client_id | Identificador único de cliente Azion. |\n| $geoloc_country_name | Nome do país do cliente remoto, por exemplo \"Russian Federation\", \"United States\". <br/>Detecção por geolocalização de endereço IP. |\n| $host | Informação de Host enviada na linha de requisição; ou campo Host do cabeçalho HTTP. |\n| $remote_address | Endereço IP da origem que gerou a requisição. |\n| $server_protocol | O protocolo da conexão estabelecida, usualmente \"HTTP/1.1\" ou \"HTTP/2.0\". |\n| $time | Data e hora da requisição. |\n| $total_blocked | Informa o número total de requisições bloqueadas. |\n| $total_processed | Informa o número de requisições processadas. |\n| $waf_action | Informa o tipo ação tomada pelo WAF ($PASS, $BLOCK, $LEARNING_PASS). |\n| $waf_args | Os argumentos da requisição. |\n| $waf_learning | Informa se o WAF está em modo learning, usualmente 0 ou 1. |\n| $waf_match | Lista de infrações encontradas na request, é formada por elementos chave-valor; a chave é referente ao tipo de infração detectada; o valor apresenta a string que gerou a infração. |\n| $waf_score | Informa a pontuação que será incrementada em caso de match. |\n| $waf_server | Hostname utilizado na requisição. |\n| $waf_uri | URI utilizada na requisição. |\n\n***\n\n## Time Filter\n\nO Real-Time Events armazena os eventos das últimas *168 horas*. O Time Filter possibilita que você refine o resultado da busca de eventos e vem por padrão selecionado para **Last 15 minutes**. Você pode filtrar com os seguinttes intervalos de tempo:\n\n* Last 15 minutes\n* Last 30 minutes\n* Last 1 hour\n* Last 3 hours\n* Last 6 hours\n* Last 12 hours\n* Last day\n* Last 2 days\n* Last 3 days\n* Last 5 days\n* Last 7 days\n\n> **Observação:** usando o campo *Custom*, você também pode personalizar sua busca selecionando um intervalo de tempo durante as últimas 168 horas.\n\n***\n\n## Filter by\n\nNo campo _Filter by_, você pode filtrar, opcionalmente, os resultados da pesquisa usando uma palavra-chave ou frase.\n\nAo enviar uma pesquisa com o campo _Filter by_ em branco, você obtém todos os registros existentes na _Data Origin_ para o filtro de tempo selecionado.\n\nAs buscas são restritas a um determinado campo, usando a seguinte notação: `key='value'`, tal como `status='200'`. Neste caso, você filtrará apenas os registros que têm estes par, valor e chave especificados. Como chave, você pode utilizar as variáveis das tabelas acima, mas observe que cada _Data Source_ tem _sua própria_ lista de variáveis.\n\n> O filtro por tempo é feito utilizando os campos **_Time Filter_** ou **_Custom_**, por este motivo não é possível utilizar a chave \"timestamp\" no filtro.\n\nVocê pode procurar por composições de campo mais complexas. Use as notações AND, OR e NOT no campo de busca para combinar os campos, tais como `status='200' AND scheme='https'`.\n\nO campo _Filter by_ utiliza a linguagem SQL, portanto você deve usar _\"igual\"_ (=) após a chave e _\"aspas simples\"_ ( ' ) em torno de valores, por exemplo: `status='200'`.\n\nSe você pretende buscar um valor mais genérico, você pode usar o operador _\"like\"_ em vez de _\"igual\"_, exatamente como você usa nas consultas SQL. A consulta final para esta busca pode ser `host like '%mydomain%'`.\n\n***\n\n## Refresh\n\nA busca retorna sempre os resultados ordenados pelo horário de ocorrência do evento, do mais recente para o mais antigo.\n\nVocê pode utilizar o botão Refresh para atualizar os dados retornados, repetindo a última busca realizada.\n\n\n",

Você pode:\n\n- [Personalizar seu próprio dashboard](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/azion-plugin-grafana/)\n- [Usar um dashboard pré-configurado para visualizar os gráficos de Data Transferred](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/azion-plugin-grafana-dash-pre-configurado/)\n\nConfira a seguir a função para estas guias:\n\n[_Data Transferred_](#DataTransferred) - [_Requests_](#Requests) _-_ [_Status Codes_](#StatusCodes) _-_ [_HTTP Methods_](#HTTPMethods) _-_ [_WAF_](#WAF) _-_ [_Live Streaming_](#LiveStreaming) _-_ [_Bandwidth Saving_](#BandwidthSaving)\n\n***\n\n### Data Transferred \n\nEssa guia apresenta gráficos referentes ao volume de dados trafegados para o produto e período que você selecionou, conforme descrito a seguir.\n\n#### Edge Caching\n\nO Edge Caching é o recurso padrão disponível para todas as Edge Applications na Azion. Ele fornece uma primeira camada de cache para o conteúdo do cliente nos Azion Edges. Este gráfico mostra a soma dos dados (*Saved Data + Missed Data*) transferidos para o produto e o período que você selecionou. Na parte inferior do gráfico, você verá a quantidade total de dados (Edge Application *In* + Edge Application *Out*) transferidos para o produto e período que você selecionou.\n\nA fim de rastrear e contabilizar corretamente os dados que foram enviados ou recebidos utilizando o produto padrão Edge Caching, podemos diferenciar os seguintes dados transferidos:\n\n- **Edge Application In**: dados transferidos do usuário para os Edges, e dos Edges para a origem do cliente.\n\n![](/assets/docs/images/uploads/edge-applications-in.png)\n\n- **Edge Applications Out**: dados transferidos da origem do cliente para os Edges, e dos Edges para o usuário.\n\n![](/assets/docs/images/uploads/edge-applications-out.png)\n\n- **Edge Applications**: todos os dados que foram transferidos no processo. O valor de Edge Applications In + Edge Applications Out.\n\n![](/assets/docs/images/uploads/edge-applications.png)\n\n#### Edge Caching with L2 Enabled\n\nO L2 Caching é um add-on que expande a versatilidade do Edge Caching, fornecendo uma camada extra de conteúdo em cache antes da origem do cliente. \n\n A fim de rastrear e contabilizar corretamente os dados que foram enviados ou recebidos usando o produto Edge Caching com o L2 Caching habilitado, podemos diferenciar os seguintes dados transferidos:\n\n- **Edge Applications In**: dados transferidos do usuário para os Edges, e dos Edges para o L2 Caching.\n\n![](/assets/docs/images/uploads/l2-enabled-edge-applications-in.png)\n\n- **Edge Applications Out**: dados transferidos do L2 Caching para os Edges, e dos Edges para o usuário.\n\n![](/assets/docs/images/uploads/l2-enabled-edge-applications-out.png)\n\n- **Edge Applications**: todos os dados que foram transferidos no processo. O valor de Edge Applications In + Edge Applications Out.\n\n![](/assets/docs/images/uploads/l2-enabled-edge-applications.png)\n\n#### L2 Caching\n\nL2 Caching é um recurso opcional para Edge Applications que acrescenta uma camada adicional de cache entre os Azion Edges e a origem do cliente. Além de exibir o *L2 Caching* total, também serão exibidos os dados sobre *L2 Caching In + L2 Caching Out* separadamente na parte inferior do gráfico.\n\nA fim de rastrear e contabilizar adequadamente os dados que foram enviados ou recebidos usando o L2 Caching, podemos diferenciar os seguintes dados transferidos:\n\n- **L2 Caching In**: dados transferidos dos Edges, através do L2 Caching, até a origem do cliente. \n\n![](/assets/docs/images/uploads/l2-caching-in.png)\n\n- **L2 Caching Out**: dados transferidos da origem do cliente, através do L2 Caching para os Azion Edges.\n\n![](/assets/docs/images/uploads/l2-caching-out.png)\n\n- **L2 Caching**: todos os dados que foram transferidos no processo. O valor de L2 Caching In + L2 Caching Out.\n\n![](/assets/docs/images/uploads/l2-caching.png)\n\n#### Edge Offload\n\nEste gráfico apresenta o percentual do volume de dados que foram entregues pelo produto da Azion. É a representação do gráfico _Saved Data_ em percentuais. Você obtém as médias no intervalo selecionado na parte inferior do gráfico.\n\n#### L2 Offload\n\nEste gráfico representa _L2 Caching_ em percentuais, referente ao volume de dados que foram entregues pelo servidor de origem. Na parte inferior do gráfico, você obtém os dados de _L2 Caching_ no intervalo selecionado.\n\n#### Saved Data\n\nEste gráfico apresenta o volume de dados que foram entregues pelos servidores da Azion, sem buscar o conteúdo no servidor de origem. Você obtém os somatórios do volume do intervalo selecionado na parte inferior do gráfico.\n\n#### Missed Data\n\nEste gráfico mostra a soma dos bytes entregues pela Azion (edge para o usuário final) mais a soma dos bytes recuperados da origem (origem para edge) para as requisições que não foram armazenados em cache ou que forçaram a recuperação dos dados da origem. Por exemplo, revalidação de cache, Bypass, Miss, requisições do tipo POST, etc. Você deve considerar que ao entregar conteúdo ao usuário final, você poderá ter regras que mudam o total de bytes da requisição, como remover ou adicionar cabeçalhos diretamente no edge. Portanto, espera-se que os valores sejam diferentes para o que saiu de sua origem e para o que realmente foi entregue a seus usuários finais. Sendo assim, ao medir a quantidade de bytes que foram obtidos de sua origem pela plataforma de Edge da Azion, considere que o valor de Missed Data pode refletir aproximadamente duas vezes o que você mediu em sua origem.\n\nOs somatórios do volume no intervalo selecionado são exibidos na parte inferior do gráfico.\n\n### Bandwidth Usage\n\n**Total Bandwidth Usage**: quantidade de Mbps utilizados da banda. Você obtém a média da banda utilizada no intervalo selecionado na parte inferior do gráfico.\n\n**Bandwidth Offload**: percentual de banda que foi descarregado. A média da banda utilizada no intervalo selecionado é exibida na parte inferior do gráfico.\n\n**Saved Bandwidth**: quantidade de Mbps da banda que foi entregue pelo Edge Network sem precisar buscar o conteúdo no servidor de origem.\n\nVocê obtém a média da banda utilizada no intervalo selecionado na parte inferior do gráfico.\n\n**Missed Bandwidth**: quantidade de Mbps de banda utilizada até o servidor de origem ao buscar o conteúdo.\n\n***\n\n### Requests\n\n**Total de Requests**: quantidade de requisições realizadas ao conteúdo. Você obtém o somatório de requisições do intervalo selecionado na parte inferior do gráfico.\n\n**Saved Requests**: quantidade de requisições que foram entregues pelos servidores da Azion, sem buscar o conteúdo no servidor de origem. Você obtém o total de requisições entregues no intervalo selecionado na parte inferior do gráfico.\n\n**Missed Requests**: quantidade de requisições que foram entregues pelo servidor de origem. Isso quer dizer que a requisição foi feita aos servidores da Azion, mas o conteúdo ainda não havia sido transferido da origem para a Azion.\n\nO total de requisições para a origem no intervalo selecionado é exibido na parte inferior do gráfico.\n\n#### **Requests per Second** - _Requisições por Segundo_\n\n**Total Requests per Second**: quantidade de requisições por segundo, de clientes ao conteúdo. A média de requisições por segundo no intervalo selecionado é exibida na parte inferior do gráfico.\n\n**Requests per Second Offloaded**: percentual de requisições por segundo que foram entregues pelos servidores da Azion, sem buscar o conteúdo no servidor de origem. Você obtém a média no intervalo selecionado na parte inferior do gráfico.\n\n**Saved Requests per Second**: quantidade de requisições por segundo que foram entregues pelos servidores da Azion, sem buscar o conteúdo no servidor de origem. Você obtém a média de requisições entregues no intervalo selecionado na parte inferior do gráfico.\n\n**Missed Requests per Second**: quantidade de requisições por segundo que foram entregues pelo servidor de origem. Isso quer dizer que a requisição foi feita aos servidores da Azion, mas o conteúdo ainda não havia sido transferido da origem para a Azion.\n\nVocê obtém a média de requisições por segundo no intervalo selecionado na parte inferior do gráfico.\n\n***\n\n### Status Codes\n\nEste guia apresenta os gráficos com as informações referentes aos códigos de status de entrega de conteúdo. Saiba mais sobre _HTTP Status Codes_ neste link: [List of HTTP Status Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes).\n\n**HTTP Status Codes 2xx**: essa classe de status indica que a requisição do usuário foi recebida, entendida, aceita e processada pelo servidor.\n\n| Código | Descrição |\n| --- | --- |\n| 200 | OK: status padrão de uma requisição HTTP bem sucedida. Significa que o conteúdo foi entregue para o usuário corretamente. |\n| 204 | No Content: significa que o servidor completou a requisição, mas não havia nenhum conteúdo a ser entregue. |\n| 206 | Partial Content: o servidor está entregando somente parte do conteúdo, pois ele foi dividido em partes. |\n| 2xx | Outros Status: aqui podem constar outros tipos de Status de requisições que também foram atendidas, mas que não são muito comuns. |\n\n**HTTP Status Codes 3xx**: Essa classe de status indica que a requisição do usuário foi redirecionada e precisa de mais um passo para ser entregue.\n\n| Código | Descrição |\n| --- | --- |\n| 301 | Moved Permanently: essa e todas as requisições futuras serão redirecionadas para outra URL. |\n| 302 | Found: essa requisição foi temporariamente redirecionada para outra URL. |\n| 304 | Not Modified: é identificado pelo Header do conteúdo que ele ainda não foi modificado e não precisa ser requisitado novamente. É possível entregar o arquivo existente no Browser do usuário. |\n| 3xx | Redirection: aqui podem constar outros tipos de Status de requisições que também foram redirecionadas, mas que não são muito comuns. |\n\n**HTTP Status Codes 4xx**: essa classe de status indica que ocorreu um erro na requisição do usuário:\n\n| Código | Descrição |\n| --- | --- |\n| 400 | Bad request: o servidor não pode processar a requisição. Geralmente, por algum erro no formato da requisição. |\n| 403 | Forbidden: a requisição é válida, mas não foi autorizada no servidor. Isso significa que o usuário ou o IP que está fazendo a requisição não está autorizado para tal. |\n| 404 | Not Found: o arquivo requisitado não existe na origem. |\n| 4xx | Client Error: aqui podem constar outros tipos de Status de requisições que também geraram erros, mas que não são muito comuns. |\n\n**HTTP Status Codes 5xx**: essa classe de status indica que o servidor falhou ao tentar entregar uma requisição aparentemente válida.\n\n| Código | Descrição |\n| --- | --- |\n| 500 | Internal Server Error: é uma mensagem genérica que é dada quando há um erro inesperado no servidor, que não consegue tratar a requisição. |\n| 502 | Bad Gateway: quando o servidor está servindo como Gateway ou Proxy e recebe uma resposta inválida da origem. Geralmente, ocorre quando a origem está fora do ar. |\n| 503 | Service Unavailable: servidor não está disponível. Geralmente, um Status temporário. |\n| 5xx | Server Error: aqui podem constar outros tipos de Status de requisições que também geraram erros, mas que não são muito comuns. |\n\n***\n\n### HTTP Methods \n\nEsse gráfico mostra as requisições para o seu site segregadas conforme o método HTTP utilizado. Saiba mais sobre métodos HTTP neste link: [Hypertext Transfer Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol).\n\n| Método | Descrição |\n| --- | --- |\n| GET | Esse método de requisição só recebe dados do servidor. |\n| POST | Esse método de requisição envia dados para o servidor. |\n| HEAD | Esse método de requisição é igual a um GET, mas não recebe o corpo do HTML, somente o cabeçalho. |\n| OTHERS | Outros métodos de requisição que não são tão comuns são agrupados neste tipo. |\n\n***\n\n### WAF - Web Application Firewall \n\nPara os clientes que possuem o produto Web Application Firewall, há um gráfico específico para mostrar os comportamentos das _Requests_.\n\n**Threats vs Requests**: esse gráfico apresenta a média de ataques bloqueados no período selecionado.\n\n**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Threats**: esse gráfico representa a média de ataques do tipo Cross-Site Scripting, um tipo de vulnerabilidade tipicamente encontrado em aplicações web, que permite ao atacante inserir no lado do cliente scripts em uma página da web vista por outros usuários.\n\n**Remote File Inclusion (RFI) Threats**: esse gráfico representa a média de ataques do tipo Remote File Inclusion, um tipo de vulnerabilidade tipicamente encontrado em websites. Permite ao atacante incluir um arquivo no servidor web.\n\n**SQL Injection Threats**: esse gráfico representa a média de ataques do tipo SQL Injection, uma técnica de inserção de códigos usada para atacar aplicações baseadas em dados.\n\n**Other Threats**: esse gráfico apresenta a média de ataques bloqueados pelo WAF e que não pertencem às classificações de ataques descritas nesta seção.\n\n***\n\n### Bandwidth Saving\n\nPara os clientes que possuem o produto _Image Processor_, esse gráfico representa quanto o cliente economiza ao trafegar imagens.\n\nO total otimizado com o tráfego de imagens é exibido na parte inferior do gráfico.\n\n\n",
