# Azion docs contributing guide

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to the Azion documentation! :orange_heart:

Your contributions will help us maintain the [Azion Docs](https://docs.azion.com) portal.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

> :wave: **New to contributions?** To get an overview of the project, read the [README](README.md). Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

> - [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)

## Getting started

### :grey_exclamation: Open a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, first [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments).

If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using one of the [issue forms](https://github.com/aziontech/docs/issues/new/choose).

There are [x] types of contribution to the Azion Docs repository:

1. x
2. x

### :pencil2: Make changes

After you open an issue, you can start making changes yourself or wait for one of our technical writers to address your issue.

Only code owners from the [Azion organization](https://github.com/aziontech/) can directly create branches and open pull requests on the docs repository. If you’re not part of the Azion organization but want to contribute, [fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) first.

In your fork, make the necessary modifications to the files. <!--- Don't forget to make the changes to both English and Portuguese versions of the documentation. --->

You can branch out from main or commit the changes directly once you are happy with them.

### :speech_balloon: Create a Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

1. [Open a new PR](https://github.com/aziontech/docs/compare) by selecting your forked repository and the branch in which you commited your changes.
2. Fill the PR title and description so that we can review your PR. The description template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
3. Don't forget to [link the PR to the issue you opened](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).
4. Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge. Once you submit your PR, our code owners will review your contributions. We may ask questions or request additional information.
5. We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
6. As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
7. If you run into any merge issues, check this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

Now you'll need the approval from code owners before you can merge your changes.

### :thumbsup: Merge changes

<!--- Once you have at least two approvals from code owners, you can merge your PR. ---- Só code owners mergeam ou a pessoa tbm pode?? --->

### :white_check_mark: Close the issue

Congratulations, your PR has been merged! :tada: The issue you created will be updated once the merge has been made.

Check the Github Actions to see the status of your modifications. Once your PR is merged successfully, your contributions will be publicly visible on the [Azion Docs](https://docs.azion.com).

> Don't forget to [keep your forked repository up-to-date with the Azion docs repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork) if you wish to make more contributions in the future.
