## Functions ChatGPT integration

ChatGPT can be used in almost all tasks that involve understanding or generating natural language or code. In the development environment, it's a tool used for boosting developers productivity, helping them to:

- Explain the code being implemented.
- Generate new code.
- Refactor preexisting code.

> **How does the Functions ChatGPT integration work?**
>
> Functions Code Editor is integrated to the ChatGPT APIs, so you can use a set of features inside the editor, without opening another tab. The features go from refactoring the code to generating new code based on the prompt input.
