## Getting started

It's time to start using Azion Edge platform! Now you can build an **Edge Application from scratch**, set it up, and connect it to domains and traffic metrics. To do so, it's necessary to complete the following journey:

- Step 1. [Build an Edge Application from scratch](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/getting-started#build-edge-app){: target="blank"}: build your application as you complete the set up presented to you.
- Step 2. [Launch an Edge Application](/build-application/launch){: target="blank"}: after creating an application, you'll see a summary of your newly created application and its link. You'll also find a set of available options to finalize it according to your chosen settings.
- Step 3. [Setting up an Edge Application](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/getting-started/#settings-app){: target="blank"}: you can customize or edit your edge application's settings anytime you want.
- Step 4. [Creating a new Domain associated with your Edge Application](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/edge-application/domains){: target="blank"}: after you finish setting up your edge application, you must configure a Domain for it. This process is very important as you'll need to have Domains configured to connect your Edge Application to other Azion products.
- Step 5. [Pointing your traffic to Azion](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/getting-started/#pointing){: target="blank"}: after creating a Domain associated with your edge application, you'll need to configure it with your DNS provider.

> - If you create an edge application through **Real-Time Manager (RTM)'s homepage**: you automatically receive a Domain on Azion.
> - If you create an edge application through **Edge Application > Add Application** on the left menu: you'll need to create your Domain manually.
