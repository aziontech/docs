## Getting started

It's time to start using Azion Web Platform! Now you can build an **Applications from scratch**, set it up, and connect it to domains and traffic metrics. To do so, it's necessary to complete the following journey:

- Step 1. [Build an Applications from scratch](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/getting-started#build-edge-app){: target="blank"}: build your application as you complete the set up presented to you.
- Step 2. [Launch an Applications](/build-application/launch){: target="blank"}: after creating an application, you'll see a summary of your newly created application and its link. You'll also find a set of available options to finalize it according to your chosen settings.
- Step 3. [Setting up an Applications](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/getting-started/#settings-app){: target="blank"}: you can customize or edit your edge application's settings anytime you want.
- Step 4. [Creating a new Domain associated with your Applications](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/edge-application/domains){: target="blank"}: after you finish setting up your edge application, you must configure a Domain for it. This process is very important as you'll need to have Domains configured to connect your Applications to other Azion products.
- Step 5. [Pointing your traffic to Azion](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/getting-started/#pointing){: target="blank"}: after creating a Domain associated with your edge application, you'll need to configure it with your DNS provider.

> - If you create an edge application through **Real-Time Manager (RTM)'s homepage**: you automatically receive a Domain on Azion.
> - If you create an edge application through **Applications > Add Application** on the left menu: you'll need to create your Domain manually.

Let's create an edge application on Azion: 

### Build an Applications from scratch

The first step is [building your edge application from scratch](https://console.azion.com/build-application/build/build-from-scratch){: target="blank"}. This allows you to build your web applications to run on Azion's platform.

In the *Getting Started* section, click the **Build an Applications** block to create your own applications. Then, complete the required fields to have your edge application up and running:

1. Name your edge application.
2. Select the setup option: **Run a function**, **Fetch content from origin** or **Build an advanced Applications**.
3. Configure a function or the origin, according the option you selected. 
4. Click **Save** to continue.

After your edge application is created, the Help Center window automatically shows you a recommendation with next steps related to the setup option you chose.

Additionally, when you create your first edge application on Azion, you'll receive an email suggesting *Next Steps*. This way, you'll know some of the options to set up your applications and how to take advantage of Azion Web Platform.
