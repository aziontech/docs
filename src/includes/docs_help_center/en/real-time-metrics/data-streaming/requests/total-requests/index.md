## Total Requests

The Data Streaming Total Requests graph shows you the sum, the total amount of requests that were processed by the data streaming configured in your account.

Each request is made out of successful Data Streaming packets: when a packet with your logs is completed and sent, one request is created. Packets are created when you have 2,000 records, every 60 seconds pass, or data reaches the max size you've defined.

The graph shows the sum of all requests that occurred during the period you've selected in the time range.
