## Saved Requests

The Saved Requests graph shows the total sum of your application's requests that were delivered directly by Azion's edge, without having to take the extra step of looking for the content on the origin.

Whenever the content of your application is accessed, one request is processed. The graph then shows all requests that were saved during the period you've selected in the time range.

> Saved Requests: content is delivered directly by the edge to the origin.
>
> END USER -> EDGE -> END USER

A higher sum of saved requests means your application is using cache policies on Azion's edge more efficiently, demanding less from your origin during the period you've selected in the time range.
