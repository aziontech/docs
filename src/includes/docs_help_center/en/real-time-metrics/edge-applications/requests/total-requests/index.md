## Total Requests

The Total Requests graph shows you the sum, the total amount of all types of requests that were processed on the application's domain configured in your account.

Whenever the content of your application is accessed, one request is processed. The graph then shows all requests that occurred during the period you've selected in the time range.

**1 access = 1 request**

> The graph is divided into:
>
> - **Http Requests Total**: processed requests using the HTTP protocol.
> - **Edge Requests Total**: all types of requests; value of http + https.
> - **Https Requests Total**: processed requests using the HTTPS protocol, which uses encryption and verification.
