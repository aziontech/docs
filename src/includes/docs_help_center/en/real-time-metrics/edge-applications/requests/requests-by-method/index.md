## Requests by Method

The Requests by Method graph shows the sum of HTTP methods that were used in the requests made to your domain. At Azion, it indicates how the client interacted with the content on the domain associated with an application.

> The graph is divided into:
> 
> - **Requests Http Method Get**: retrieves resources from the server.
> - **Requests Http Method Post**: sends resources to the server.
> - **Requests Http Method Head**: retrieves data about the resource but doesn't return the content.
> - **Requests Http Method Others**: all other request methods, such as PUT or PATCH, are gathered on this option.
