## Saved Data

The Saved Data graph shows the total sum of your application's data that was delivered directly by Azion's edge, without having to take the extra step of looking for the content on the origin.

> Saved Data: content is delivered directly by the edge to the origin.
>
> END USER -> EDGE -> END USER

A higher sum of saved data means your application is using cache policies on Azion's edge more efficiently, demanding less from your origin during the period you've selected in the time range.

> Real-Time Metrics uses bytes to show your data. It automatically converts your data into megabytes (MB), gigabytes (GB), or terabytes (TB), for example, according to the amount of data available to make your visualization easier.
