## HTTP Status Codes 2XX

Whenever a domain that's associated with an Azion application receives a request, it also receives a specific status code according to the server's response. The graph then shows the sum of total requests that received a status 2XX.

The 2XX status codes indicate successful requests on the server's side. This means the request passed the stages of: received, understood, accepted, and processed by the server, and the end user is able to see your domain's content.

> The graph is divided into:
> 
> - **Requests Status Code200**: the content was delivered to the user correctly. Standard status for a successful HTTP request.
> - **Requests Status Code204**: the server completed the request, but had no content to deliver.
> - **Requests Status Code206**: the server delivered only a part of the content because it was divided into parts.
> - **Requests Status Code2xx**: the server indicated other status of the 2XX type. They rarely occur, and are all gathered on this option.
