## Total Invocations

The Total Invocations graph shows you the sum of all occasions in which your edge functions were called.

> The graph is divided into:
>
> - **Firewall Invocations**: total amount of executed edge functions associated to a firewall.
> - **Application Invocations**: total amount of executed edge functions associated to an application.

Whenever one of your configured edge functions is executed, one invocation is calculated.
