## Solution general view

### Navigation bar

When you reach the solution homepage, you'll face some tabs that will come up with information about the solution you're viewing. You'll have detailed information about these tabs further on this help widget.

The solution's homepage has a continuous navigation, so you're free to scroll down through all the content. Every section you reach will align the highlight title with the tab at the top. You can navigate back and forth between the sections by clicking on the tabs, since they'll serve as an anchor to the content. This navigation will collapse when you start to scroll down through the page, showing only the relevant information for your navigation.
