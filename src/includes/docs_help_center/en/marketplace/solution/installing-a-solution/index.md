## Installing a solution

To get a solution listed as **Functions** on your Real-Time Manager (RTM), you must first install the solution.

### Installing a solution

- Click the **Get It Now** button.
- If successful, you’ll receive the following message on your screen: **Your solution installation was successful, you can find it in Edge Function List**.
- Then, the solution will appear at the Functions list on your RTM.

### Updating a solution

When a new version of the solution is launched, a **Get New Version** button appears in the same place as the **Get It Now** button used to be, on the installation card on the right bottom of the screen.

After updating it, the **Get a New Version** button will become gray and not available. The button will only be enabled again if a new version is launched.

> **Note**: some solutions may need prerequisites to run. In this case, you’ll receive a message informing these prerequisites while you're trying to install the solution. For instance, if you need a **Tiered Cache** on your RTM, you’ll receive the following message: **"Cannot launch solution. Reason: Dependencies required: Tiered Cache"**.
