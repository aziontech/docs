## Solution details

The solution page has several fields to help you understand how the solution works, who uploaded it, how to contact support, and the current solution version. 

These fields are:

- **Name**: this is the name of the solution, which is chosen by the partner who developed it or by Azion.
- **Version**: this is the latest version of the solution available to use and run.
- **By**: it shows you the solution's developer. Could be a partner or Azion.
- **Category**: every solution on Azion's Marketplace is registered under a category. This is helpful for filtering and knowing the core features of the solutions.
- **Last Updated**: the solutions store older versions. You can run a previous version or update to the latest one. The **Last Updated** field shows the solution's latest updates.

> If your Functions are using previous versions of a solution, they wonâ€™t be automatically updated or affected by it. To run the latest version, go to the functions section on your Edge Application and select the new version. Visit the [Updating a version of your solution on Marketplace's documentation](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/marketplace#versioning) page to learn more.
