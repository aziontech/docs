## Import an existing project from GitHub

This option enables you to import an existing project from GitHub and deploy it on Azion Web Platform.

You need to complete all the three steps to do so:

1. **Import an existing project**: connect your Azion account to GitHub to use your own repositories and deploy edge applications on Azion's edge.
2. **Set up your edge applications**: define the basic information and building settings for your application. 
3. **Deploy to the edge**: when you finish the previous steps, just click the button to start the deployment process. 

On the top of the page, the tabs indicate the stage of the building process you're in. If you want to return to the homepage, just click the **Back to home** button on the upper-left corner.

> **Some tips to import your project**
>
> - If it's your first time connecting your Azion account with GitHub, a window will appear requesting authorization.
> - Use the dropdown menu to choose the *Git Scope* you'll work with while building a new application.
> - It's possible import just *one repository* for each application.
> - The settings must be configured according to the framework your project was developed. 

### Supported frameworks

Your project must be developed in one of the frameworks supported by Azion; currently, [Next.js is supported](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-functions/runtime-api/supported-frameworks/nextjs/).

In case of importing projects based on other frameworks, Real-Time Manager won't complete the building and deployment processes. For more details, see the [Supported Frameworks and Azion Runtime](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/runtime/overview/) documentation.
