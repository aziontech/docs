### Getting to know Functions

Azion [Functions](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-functions) is a module of your Applications that enables you to program and execute serverless functions without the need to provision or manage servers. All processing occurs directly at the edge of the network, closer to users.
