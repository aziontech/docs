Next steps to continue your Azion setup:

1. Wait for your application to be published and access it through the link provided on the Launch page.

2. View your Edge Application Logs and lookup your access by searching the Edge Applications data source. [Real-Time Events](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/real-time-events) is located on the **Products Menu** on the top left corner, in the **Observe** section.

3. [Link your DNS with your Edge Application](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/getting-started#creating-domain) or explore more by creating your own Functions with a [step by step guide](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-functions#stepbystepcreatinganedgefunction) and using the [Functions JavaScript Examples](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-functions/javascript-examples).

4. You may also consider migrating your entire DNS zone to our [Intelligent DNS](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/intelligent-dns).
