1. Wait for your application to be published and access it through the link provided on the Launch page.

2. View your Applications Logs and lookup your access by searching the Applications data source. [Real-Time Events](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/real-time-events) is located on the **Products Menu** on the top left corner, in the **Observe** section.

3. [Link your DNS with your Applications](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/getting-started#creating-domain) or explore more by creating your own Functions with a [step by step guide](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-functions#stepbystepcreatinganedgefunction) and using the [Functions JavaScript Examples](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-functions/javascript-examples).
