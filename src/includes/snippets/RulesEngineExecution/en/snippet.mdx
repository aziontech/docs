While behaviors and rules are executed in the order they're arranged, some behaviors can't be stacked. 

If a behavior of the type **Set**, such as **Set Custom Response** in Firewall and **Set Origin** in Applications, is added multiple times to the rules in Rules Engine, only the last behavior from the last rule in which the criteria was met will be executed.

Behaviors of the type **Add** are cumulative and can be added multiple times to rules. This means that if **Add Cookie** and **Add Header** are executed multiple times for the same key-value pairs, multiple identical entries will be added.

However, for unique headers such as `Host`, the last behavior of type **Add Header** that is executed will overwrite the previous value, since there can't be more than one `Host` header in a request. 

Some behaviors, such as **Deny**, can finish the execution of rules. If a sequence of rules includes such behavior, any rules or behaviors that follow this type of finalizing behavior won't be executed.
