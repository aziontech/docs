While behaviors and rules are executed in the order they're arranged, some behaviors can't be stacked. 

If a behavior of the type **Set**, such as **Set Custom Response** in Edge Firewall and **Set Origin** in Edge Application, is added multiple times to the rules in Rules Engine, only the last behavior from the last rule in which the criteria was met will be executed.

Behaviors of the type **Add** are cumulative and can be added multiple times to rules. This means that if **Add Cookie** and **Add Header** are executed multiple times for the same key-value pairs, multiple identical entries will be added.

However, for unique headers such as `Host`, the last behavior of type **Add Header** that is executed will overwrite the previous value, since there can't be more than one `Host` header in a request. 

Some behaviors, such as **Deny**, can finish the execution of rules. If a sequence of rules includes such behavior, any rules or behaviors that follow this type of finalizing behavior won't be executed.
