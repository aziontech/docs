:::caution[warning]
Let's Encrypt certificates cross-signed by IdenTrust will expire on September 30th, 2024. Devices and applications using the [Let's Encrypt certificate that uses IdenTrust will become invalid](https://letsencrypt.org/2023/07/10/cross-sign-expiration.html). This could impact the functionality of devices and applications utilizing these certificates, mainly users of older Android devices (pre-7.1). It'll be necessary to take the following actions:

- **For users of Let's Encrypt Certificates with IdenTrust**: you must migrate to the new Let's Encrypt signing technology or an [Azion edge certificate](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/digital-certificates/#edge-certificate).
- **For users of other types of Let's Encrypt**: no immediate action is necessary, considering other certificates remain unaffected with this update, since the problem is caused by outdated certificate chains on the device.
- **For user with applications using Let's Encrypt in Azion**: no action needed. Certificates are automatically updated, although an affected device must have its CAs updated as well.
