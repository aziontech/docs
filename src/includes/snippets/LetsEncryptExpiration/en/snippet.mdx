Let's Encrypt certificates cross-signed by IdenTrust will expire on September 30th, 2024. Other types of Let's Encrypt certificates won't be affected, but devices and applications using the [Let's Encrypt certificate that uses IdenTrust will become invalid](https://letsencrypt.org/2023/07/10/cross-sign-expiration.html). If you use this type of certificate, you must migrate to the new Let's Encrypt signing technology or an [Azion edge certificate](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/digital-certificates/#edge-certificate).
