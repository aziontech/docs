# Checking if your WAF is operating in *blocking* or *learning* mode



Azion services are constantly evolving and improving. If you are still using outdated configurations or if you need to change your WAF from *blocking* to *learning* mode (or vice versa) and can't find where to do it, please read the following instructions.

The WAF behaviors that were previously executed and created inside Edge Application, are a module of Edge Firewall, therefore it is necessary that the migration of information for the WAF behaviors is migrated to the updated version.

#### How to migrate WAF settings

1. Log into the  [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/) and under Edge Application, select the application you want and check the WAF settings on the **Rules Engine** tab;

   > Previously, the *Edge Firewall* and *Web Application Firewall* flags were found under *Edge Application* on the *Main Settings* tab. In the current version, these settings are available under **Edge Firewall**.

2. Copy the WAF settings you want;

3. From  [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/), go to **Edge Firewall** and click **Add Rule set**;

4. Give your Edge Firewall a name, select the *Domain*, enable the *Network Layer Protection* and *Web Application Firewall* flags;

5. Click **Save** to save your settings; 

6. Click the **Rules Engine** tab (which will be displayed right after you save the previous configuration) and then click **New Rule**;

7. In **Criteria**, select **Request URI** and fill in the same settings that you copied from *Edge Application/Rules Engine* (item 2), that is the same *logical operator* and/or the same *regular expression*;

8. In **Behavior**, select *Set WAF Rule Set*, select the Rule Set you want, and choose *Learning* or *Blocking* mode.

**Note:** during migration both settings work at the same time. After 5 minutes, you can disable *Edge Firewall* and *Web Application Firewall* flags in *Edge Application>Rules Engine*, as they will already be saved as rules in **Edge Firewall**.
