**Network Layer Protection** is a module within **Edge Firewall** from Azion’s Edge Computing platform. It allows you to create custom *Network Lists* based on the user's IP, ASN, and geolocation addresses, or to use automatic lists that are maintained and updated by Azion, such as the Tor network address list.

This allows you to monitor suspicious behavior, create intelligent rules, and apply restrictions on malicious activity by blocking or limiting access and giving protection to your applications’ incoming and outgoing traffic in the network layer on the Edge.

Some of the other advantages of using Azion’s **Network Layer Protection** are:

* Easy to integrate with SIEM and other security tools in your infrastructure using blocklist maintenance APIs.
* Processing on the Edge in real-time, enabling the origin infrastructure to maintain its level of performance.
* The option to run business rules on the Edge.

## How it works

The **Network Layer Protection** service uses a series of lists maintained by the user themselves or by Azion, which can be updated manually or via an API. When a request reaches an Azion Edge Node, it is assessed and, if it meets the criteria set in the Rule Set for that Edge, the configured lists are queried, thereby filtering out known offenders even before the request reaches the client’s infrastructure.

When activating the module within an **Edge Firewall**, the *Network Criteria* and the *Deny*, *Drop*, and *Set Rate Limit Behaviors* become available in the *Rules Engine* settings of the selected *Rule Set*. This allows the client to define under what conditions the lists will be queried and what behaviors should be executed.

## Activating the Network Layer Protection module

To enable the **Network Layer Protection** module, access **Real-Time Manager (RTM)**, open the **Products Menu**, and select *Edge Firewall*. Then, in the **Main Settings** tab, activate the **Network Layer Protection** switch.

Once enabled, custom lists need to be created along with the evaluation criteria and behaviors set that will be applied by the **Edge Firewall**.

## Creating a Network List

Path: **Real-Time Manager** > **Edge Libraries** > **Network Lists**

When opening the *Network Lists* page, all lists created by the user and those items automatically provided by Azion will be displayed, such as [**Origin Shield**](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/network-layer-protection/#origin-shield).

To create a new one, click the *Add* button, choose an identifiable *name* for your list (for example, *BlockedIPsList*, for a list of known malicious IPs), select the desired *Type*, and complete the list according to the type you have chosen (*ASN*, *Countries* or *IP / CIDR*. For our example, we are using the IP/CIDR option), and then click *Save*. The user’s list can be updated anytime, either manually or integrated through an API.

Example of the configuration of an IP/CIDR type list:

```
123.456.789.1
123.456.789.2/32
10.1.1.0/16
```

## Defining the Execution criteria

Path: **Real-Time Manager** > **Edge Firewall** > **Rules Engine**

Create a new *Rule Set* inside your **Edge Firewall** or edit an existing one. The rules (or *Rules Engines*) determine the set of conditions that need to be met for *Behaviors* to be executed. You can create a new rule to set the validation parameters and the behaviors for this *Rule Set* to be run by **Edge Firewall**.

Defining the validation criteria: choose the *variables*, *comparison operators*, and *strings* to create your business rule, as in the following example:

* If: Network matches BadBotsList

> In order: logical operator, variable, comparison operator, string.

In this case, the rule will run if the IP address of the request is on the list *BadBotsList*.

Defining Behaviors: add the behaviors you want to be carried out when the rule's conditions are met. Example:

* Then: Drop (Close Without Response)

> In order: logical operator, action.

In this example, if the conditions set by the rules are met, then a *Drop* will be run for the request without sending any return to the sender.
