Aggregated data can also be considered as structured data that have been clustered. They go through modifications to allow a better analytic processing seeking a segmented analysis.

To query the available aggregated data in the [GraphQL API](/en/documentation/products/graphql-api-overview), follow the steps described on [How to query GraphQL requests on Postman](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/query-graphql-postman/) using the `https://api.azionapi.net/metrics/graphql` URL.

Then, on Postman’s GraphQL request code box, add the following **Aggregated Query**, modifying the `tsRange` to fit the time interval you want:

```graphql
query HttpQuery {
  httpMetrics(
    limit: 10,
    filter: {
      tsRange: {begin:"2022-03-21T10:10:10", end:"2022-06-23T10:10:10"}
    }
    aggregate: {sum: bytesSent}
    groupBy: [ts]
    orderBy: [ts_ASC]
  )
  {
    ts
    sum
  }
}
```

On the example above, you'll query for an aggregated table of the **HTTP** dataset. Furthermore, the **sum** operator was used to request the aggregated data with information regarding the **bytesSent** field in a set range of time periods, informed through the **tsRange** field.

Lastly, the presented data were grouped and ordered through the **ts** (timestamp) field.

To query aggregated data, it's *mandatory* to inform:

- A time range interval for queries, using either **tsRange** or **tsGt** + **tsLt**.
- The fields whose information you want to group, using **groupBy**.
- Which consulted data should be exhibited. On the presented example, the **ts** and **sum** fields were used, in which **sum** represents the response of the **bytesSent** aggregation.

To aggregate information made available through the **GraphQL API** as in the presented example, there are a few options that you must inform through the **aggregate** field in your query. They are:

- **Count**: determines the total value of records meeting a specific condition.
- **Sum**: returns the sum of the entry values of a column or expression.
- **Max**: returns the maximum value of a determined field of a table according to the established selection criteria.
- **Min**: returns the minimum value of a determined field of a table according to the established selection criteria.
- **Avg**: calculates the arithmetic mean of a set of values in a specific field being consulted.
- **Rate**: used for the imagesProcessed dataset. Obtains the rate of images being processed by second while using Image Processor.

> You can run a request with one of each of the available options: **count**, **sum**, **max**, **min**, **avg**, and **rate**, as long as each option is only used *once* and each operator aggregates only *one* dataset field at a time. See the following example:

```graphql
aggregate: {
    count: rows, 
    sum: bytesSent, 
    avg: requestTime, 
    max: requestLength,
    min: missedData,
    rate: requestTime
}
```

Send your request. You’ll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
   "data": {
       "httpMetrics": [
           {
               "ts": "2022-06-09T21:33:13",
               "sum": 1471.0
           },
           {
               "ts": "2022-06-09T21:33:14",
               "sum": 1471.0
           },
           {
               "ts": "2022-06-09T21:33:15",
               "sum": 1471.0
           }
       ]
   }
}
```

The GraphQL API returned the aggregated data with the **sum** operator for the **bytesSent** field, according to the query informed in the request.
