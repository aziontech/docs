### Azion Lib

Azion Lib are JavaScript/TypeScript tools designed to work inside the [Azion Runtime](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/runtime/overview/), leveraging internal features for enhanced performance. They also function outside the runtime, accessing Azion services such as Purge, Edge Storage, and Image Processor via REST APIs. The libraries support debug mode and environment variable configuration.
