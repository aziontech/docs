With it, you can initialize, build, and deploy applications, create Jamstack apps, manage your projects, run a local development server, and link existing projects to Azion applications.

<Button href="/en/documentation/products/azion-cli/overview/" label="View details" type="primary" theme="light" />

### Azion Lib

Azion Lib are JavaScript/TypeScript tools designed to work inside the [Azion Runtime](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/runtime/overview/), leveraging internal features for enhanced performance. They also function outside the runtime, accessing Azion services such as Purge, Object Storage, and Image Processor via REST APIs. The libraries support debug mode and environment variable configuration.

<Button href="/en/documentation/products/azion-lib/overview/" label="View details" type="primary" theme="light" />

### Console Kit

It connects to the Azion API, supports multi-tenancy, and lets you customize themes and UI for your business needs. The kit features a clean, organized structure for maintainable code.

<Button href="/en/documentation/devtools/console-kit/" label="View details" type="primary" theme="light" />

### GraphQL API

GraphQL is a powerful API language that allows precise data retrieval, avoiding overfetching and enhancing performance. Unlike traditional REST APIs, it uses a single endpoint and delivers tailored JSON responses. At Azion, GraphQL is ideal for accessing real-time metrics, events, billing, and accounting data, enabling efficient monitoring and analysis.
