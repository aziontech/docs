## Start Here: Kick Off Your Project with Ready-to-Use Templates

The fastest way to start using the Azion Web Platform. Deploy instantly from dozens of templates, including e-commerce, blogs, APIs, full-stack SSR, and more; leverage integrations by connecting to Sanity, Cosmic, ButterCMS, Turso, or bringing your own RESTful CMS or database. CI/CD is auto-configured so you can focus on your code, not the pipeline.
