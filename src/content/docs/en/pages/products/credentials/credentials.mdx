:::note
Credentials are used solely for **Edge Orchestrator**. To generate tokens for APIs, head to the [API documentation](https://api.azion.com/) or the [Personal Tokens documentation](/en/documentation/products/accounts/personal-tokens/).
:::

You can generate credentials to use and authenticate Edge Orchestrator services through Real-Time Manager (RTM).

The following options are available when clicking on the created credential:

- Copy the generated token.
- Delete your credential.
- Edit your credential. Here you can update your credential's name, description, and status (active/inactive).

:::note
The token will be generated after the credential is saved.
:::

You can copy your token with the **Copy token** icon. You'll see the following message: **Token copied to the clipboard!**

You can delete the token with the **Delete** icon. You'll see a confirmation message on the screen.
