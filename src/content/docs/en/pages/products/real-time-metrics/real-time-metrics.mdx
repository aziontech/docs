**Real-Time Metrics** is an **Observe** product that provides you with real-time access to metrics so you can optimize all of your  potential through our platform.

Get to know what's happening on the platform and track the behavior of your applications in real time.

**Important**: when comparing the data displayed on Real-Time Metrics and Azion Billing data, you may find differences. Real-Time Metrics focuses on performance, using an at-most-once approach, while Billing seeks precision, using an exactly-once approach. If you find such differences, you should consider Azion Billing data as the correct one.

On average, the difference between the two is smaller than 1%. See [Azion Pricing](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/) and the [Billing documentation](/en/documentation/products/accounts/billing/) for more information.

## Accessing Real-Time Metrics

You are about to get real-time insights from your applications. Get started with Real-Time Metrics as follows:

* Enter **[Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/)**, go to the **Products Menu** and click on **Real-Time Metrics** in the **Observe** section.

You’ll be directed to the Real-Time Metrics page, which displays the Edge Applications product graphs by default.

***

## Basics 

The Real-Time Metrics screen is composed of the _Data Interval Filter_ section and the _Data_ section.

* _Data Interval Filter_ section: where you set the domain or the period that you would like to check out.
* _Data_ section: where graphs are displayed according to your filter selection.

Real-Time Metrics enables you to apply filters to focus on a variety  of data by simply selecting a period or domain you want to analyze.

> As you hover the mouse over the graphs, you’ll get the exact values for each moment in the selected period.

***

## Selecting your Data Interval Filter

As you access Real-Time Metrics, you’ll see checkboxes on top of the page with the filter options available for that product.

All the graph options for the products in Real-Time Metrics have the  Data Interval Filter. Some graphs allow you to filter by domain as  follows:

1. Select the domain from the _Configurations_ list and the time interval from the _Time Range_ list;
2. Click on the **Filter** button to apply your selections.

The graphs are updated and the information is displayed accordingly.

> Note that the graphs presented will vary according to the products you have contracted.

***

## Exporting to CSV 

You can export graph's information as a CSV file. After applying the filters, click on the **CSV** icon on the upper-right corner of the graph you want to export. Data will be exported according to the information displayed on the graph, the time range you've applied, and with the interval of minutes, hours, or days.

***

## Interpreting your Graphs

The information is displayed according to the product and period of time selected in the filters. Graphs will be grouped in tabs as described in the section _Tracking your Applications_.

***

## Tracking your Applications 

Data is key when making decisions. Real-Time Metrics offers you a  variety of options displayed in tabs, so you can support your actions more effectively.

### Data Transferred

This tab displays graphs referring to the amount of data transferred for the product and period you have selected as described here.

#### Edge Caching

Edge Caching is the standard feature available for all Edge Applications at Azion. It provides a first layer of caching to the client content on Azion Edges. This graph shows the sum of data (*Saved Data* + *Missed Data*) transferred for the product and period you have selected. At the bottom of the graph, you will see the total amount of data (Edge Application *In* + Edge Application *Out*) transferred for the product and period you have selected.

In order to track and properly account the data that was sent or received using the standard Edge Caching product, we can distinguish the following data transferred:

- **Edge Application In**: data transferred from the user to the Edges, and from the Edges to the client origin.

![Edge Application IN](/assets/docs/images/uploads/edge-applications-in.png)

- **Edge Applications Out**: data transferred from the client origin to the Edges, and from the Edges to the user.

![Edge Application OUT](/assets/docs/images/uploads/edge-applications-out.png)

- **Edge Applications**: all data that was transferred in the process. The value of Edge Applications In + Edge Applications Out.

#### Edge Caching with L2 Enabled

L2 Caching is an add-on that expands the Edge Caching versatility, providing an extra layer of cached content before the client origin. 

In order to track and properly account the data that was sent or received using the Edge Caching product with the L2 Caching enabled, we can distinguish the following data transferred:

- **Edge Applications In**: data transferred from the user to the Edges, and from the Edges to the L2 Caching.

![Edge Applications IN](/assets/docs/images/uploads/l2-enabled-edge-applications-in.png)

- **Edge Applications Out**: data transferred from the L2 Caching to the Edges, and from the Edges to the user.

![Edge Applications OUT](/assets/docs/images/uploads/l2-enabled-edge-applications-out.png)

- **Edge Applications**: all data that was transferred in the process. The value of Edge Applications In + Edge Applications Out.

![Edge Applications](/assets/docs/images/uploads/l2-enabled-edge-applications.png)

#### L2 Caching

L2 Caching is an optional feature for Edge Applications that adds an additional layer of cache between the Azion Edges and the client origin. Additionally to displaying the total *L2 Caching*, you will also get the data on *L2 Caching In* + *L2 Caching Out* displayed separately at the bottom of the graph.

In order to track and properly account the data that was sent or received using L2 Caching, we can distinguish the following data transferred:

- **L2 Caching In**: data transferred from the Edges, through L2 Caching until the client origin. 

![L2 Caching IN](/assets/docs/images/uploads/l2-caching-in.png)

- **L2 Caching Out**: data transferred from the client origin, through L2 Caching to the Azion Edges.

![L2 Caching OUT](/assets/docs/images/uploads/l2-caching-out.png)

- **L2 Caching**: all data that was transferred in the process. The value of L2 Caching In + L2 Caching Out.

![L2 Caching](/assets/docs/images/uploads/l2-caching.png)

#### Edge Offload

This graph displays the percentage of the amount of data delivered by the Azion product. It displays the _Saved Data_ graph in percentages. You'll see the averages for the selected period displayed at the bottom of the graph.

#### L2 Offload

This graph displays _L2 Caching_ in percentages. It refers to the amount of data delivered by the origin server. You'll get _L2 Caching_ data for the selected period at the bottom of the graph.

#### Saved Data

This graph displays the sum of  data delivered by Azion servers, without looking up content on the origin server. You'll see the total amount for the selected period  displayed at the bottom of the graph.

#### Missed Data

This graph displays the sum of bytes delivered by Azion (edge to end-user) plus the sum of bytes retrieved from origin (origin to edge) for the requests that were not cached or forced the data retrieval from the origin. For example: Cache revalidation, Bypass, Miss, POST requests, etc. You'll have to consider that when delivering content to the end-user, you may have rules that change the total bytes of the request, like removing or adding headers directly in the edge. Therefore, it is expected to have different values for what came out from your origin and what was really delivered to your end users. So, when measuring the amount of bytes that were fetched from your origin by the Azion Edge platform, consider that the _Missed Data_ value may reflect roughly two times what you measured at your origin.

You'll see the total amount for the selected period displayed at the bottom of the graph.

### Bandwidth Usage

**Total Bandwidth Usage:**  Quantity of MBps in  bandwidth used. You'll see the average bandwidth used during the  selected period displayed at the bottom of the graph.

**Bandwidth Offloaded:** Percentage of the bandwidth  that was offloaded. You'll see the average bandwidth used during the  selected period displayed at the bottom of the graph.

**Saved Bandwidth:** Quantity of MBps of  bandwidth that was delivered directly through the Edge Network, without  looking up content on the origin server.

You'll see the average bandwidth used during the selected period displayed at the bottom of the graph.

**Missed Bandwidth:** Quantity of MBps of bandwidth used by the origin server searching for content.

***

### Requests

### Status Codes 

This tab displays the graphs with information related to the Status  Codes of the content delivered. Learn more about the HTTP Status Codes  at [List of HTTP Status Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes).

**HTTP Status Codes 2xx:** This type of status indicates that the user request was received, understood, accepted and processed by the server.

| Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 200 | OK: Standard status for a successful HTTP request. It means that the content was delivered to the user correctly. |
| 204 | No Content: It means that the server completed the request, but had no content to deliver. |
| 206 | Partial Content: The server delivered only a part of the content because it was divided into parts. |
| 2xx | Other Status: There can be other types of Status for requests that have also been handled, but they are not common. |

**HTTP Status Codes 3xx**: This type of status code indicates that the user request was redirected and needs to go through another stage to be delivered.

| Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 301 | Moved Permanently: This and all future requests will be redirected to another URL. |
| 302 | Found: This request was temporarily redirected to another URL. |
| 304 | Not Modified: The content header indicates that the it has not been modified and does not need to be resent. It can deliver the existing file to the user’s browser. |
| 3xx | Redirection: There can be other types of Status for requests that were also redirected, but they are not common. |

**HTTP Status Codes 4xx**: This type of status code indicates that an error has occurred with the user’s request.

| Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 400 | Bad request: The server cannot process the request, generally this is due to an error with the request format. |
| 403 | Forbidden: The request is valid, but was not  authorized by the server. This means that the user or the IP that is  making the request is not authorized to do so. |
| 404 | Not Found: The file that the request was for does not exist on the origin server. |
| 4xx | Client Error: There can be other types of Status for requests that also generate errors, but they are not common. |

**HTTP Status Codes 5xx**: This type of status indicates that the server failed to deliver an apparently valid request.

| Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 500 | Internal Server Error: This is the generic message given, when an unexpected error occurs on the server and it is unable to handle the request. |
| 502 | Bad Gateway: When the server is acting as a Gateway or Proxy and receives an invalid response from the origin. It generally occurs when the origin server is offline. |
| 503 | Service Unavailable: Server is not available. Generally a temporary Status. |
| 5xx | Server Error: There can be other types of Status for requests that also generate errors, but they are not common. |
