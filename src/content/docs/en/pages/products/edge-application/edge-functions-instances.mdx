**Edge Functions** for **Edge Application** enables you to instantiate serverless functions within your Azion edge application, while also configuring execution conditions. These functions are processed at the edge, responding to events with remarkable speed, thus ensuring superior scalability and availability.

> Edge functions are also available for [Edge Firewall](/documentation/products/edge-firewall/edge-functions-instances/).

## How it works

To instantiate an edge function in your edge application, you must first [create one](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-functions/). Once the function is saved, you can proceed with the instantiation for your applications.

During the instantiation process, you cannot modify the function's code. Instead, you need to provide the arguments that will be passed to the context of the function's execution in JSON format, using the Args tab.

> **Warning**: The Args field supports a maximum of 100KB of arguments.

To associate an execution trigger, create a rule using [Rules Engine](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/rules-engine) and select the **Run Function** behavior, either in the Request or Response Phase. When a request meets the defined criteria in the rule, the edge function will be invoked and executed directly in Azion's edge nodes.
