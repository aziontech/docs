**Rules Engine** is an [Edge Application](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/) capability that handles the conditional execution of behaviors through logical operators. By using Rules Engine, you can build an architecture that provides better performance to your users while consuming fewer resources by processing at the origin.

---

## How it works

Each requisition made to an application built with Azion [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/) is processed in a fixed sequence of two phases: first the **Request Phase**, then the **Response Phase**.

At each processing phase, you can define a set of rules to handle the request according to the needs of your application or business. Once you have selected in which of the two phases your rule will be executed, you'll be able to create a new rule.

Rules are designed to follow a conditional *if-then* logic. Every rule is composed of **Criteria** (*if*) that will define the set of conditions that must be met for the execution of **Behaviors** (*then*).

You can use a set of variables, comparison operators, and logical operators to trigger the desired behaviors for your application. If the conditions are met, the behaviors of each rule are executed until all the rules are processed.

> **Warning**: some behaviors can finish the execution of rules. If a sequence of rules includes such behavior, any rules or behaviors that follow the finalizing behavior won't be executed.

Before you create a rule, you should enable the [Application Acceleration](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/application-acceleration/) module, which extends the usability of **Rules Engine** by applying serverless computing features to **Edge Application**. If the module is disabled, only some variables and Behaviors will be available for your rule.

> See [Creating rules using Rules Engine for Edge Application](/en/documentation/products/guides/static-sites-on-edge/) for a step-by-step guide on how to use Rules Engine.

## Processing phases

When creating a rule, you'll be prompted to select one of the two available processing phases: **Request Phase** or **Response Phase**.

### Request Phase

In the **Request Phase**, you can handle your user’s request according to your business rules and define which origins should handle the request in case the requested content isn't cached.

You can use any variable related to the data sent by your user in the request as variables for Request Phase rules. As the response hasn't been processed by your application yet, you don't have access to variables related to the content that will be delivered to your user in this phase.

You also define how Azion should manage your application’s cache in the Request Phase. If your application doesn't allow any type of cache, you can define the conditions to ignore caching.

### Response Phase

In the **Response Phase**, your application handles what will be delivered to your users. All handling processed in the Response Phase is dynamic and will be performed individually for each user.

---

## Description

Aside from the name of the rule, you can add a description to your rule using the **Description** field. Your description will be visible from the rule list and can be used to help you identify what the rule does.

---

## Criteria

The **Criteria** section of **Rules Engine** is where you define the conditions for executing the rule.Criteria are composed of:

- variables
- comparison operators
- arguments, when applicable

The inclusion of arguments in a criteria depends on the comparison operators chosen. The format of the arguments is described in the [variables](#variables) and [comparison operators](#comparison-operators) sections below. You can also add [logical operators](#logical-operators) to increase the amount of comparisons that the rule will execute.

For example, this criteria identifies whether a user is accessing your application via a desktop web browser using a regular expression as an argument:

|  | Variable  | Comparison operator | Argument |
| --- | ---- | --- | --- |
| If | `${http_user_agent}` | *matches* | `(Chrome|Mozilla)` |

### Variables

| Variable | Description | Phase |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `${arg_name}` | The name argument sent by the user on the request line (query string). For example: for the GET `/path?Search=test` request, the variable will assume the value `test`. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |
| `${args}` | All arguments sent by the user in the request string (query string). For example: for the GET `/path?Search=test` request, the variable will assume the value `Search=test`. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |
| `${cookie_name}` | Value of the cookie name. For example, for `cookie_icl_current_language = pt-br`, the variable `${cookie_icl_current_language}` will assume the value `pt-br`. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |
| `${device_group}` | User device group. You can customize your [device groups](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/device-groups/) in the **Device Groups** tab of your application in Real-Time Manager. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |
| `${domain}` | Similar to the `${host}` variable. Stores the host name or the Host header from the request, excluding the last subdomain after the second-level domain. For example, for a domain `az.blog.domain.com`, this variable carries the value `blog.domain.com`. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |
| `${geoip_city}` | Name of the city, using the geolocation base `geoip_city`. For example: `Sao Paulo`, `London`. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |
| `${geoip_city_continent_code}` | 2-letter continent code, using the geolocation base `geoip_city`. For example: `EU` for Europe, `NA` for North America. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |
| `${geoip_city_country_code}` | 2-letter country code, using the geolocation base `geoip_city`. For example: `RU` for Russia, `BR` for Brazil. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |
| `${geoip_city_country_name}` | Name of the country, using the geolocation base `geoip_city`. For example: `United States`, `Brazil`. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |
| `${geoip_continent_code}` | 2-letter continent code. For example: `EU` for Europe, `NA` for North America. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |
| `${geoip_country_code}` | 2-letter country code, using the geolocation base `geoip_country`. For example: `RU` for Russia, `BR` for Brazil. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |
| `${geoip_country_name}` | Name of the country, using the geolocation base `geoip_country`. For example: `United States`, `Brazil`. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |
| `${geoip_region_name}` | Name of the country, using the geolocation base `geoip_region`. For example: `Ontario`, `Sao Paulo`. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |
| `${geoip_region}` | 2-letter region code. For example: `RS` for Rio Grande do Sul, `ON` for Toronto. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |
| `${host}` | In order of precedence: the host name of the request line, or the value of the Host header field of the request, or the name of the server serving the request. For example: `blog.domain.com`. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |
| `${http_name}` | The value of a request header. `name` must be a valid [HTTP request header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Request_header) converted to lowercase; hyphens must be converted to underscore. For example: `${http_accept}` will take the value of the `Accept` header of the HTTP request field. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |
| `${remote_addr}` | The IP address of the client performing the HTTP request. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |
| `${remote_user}` | The username provided by basic authentication, if any. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |
| `${request}` | Complete request query. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |
| `${request_method}` | The HTTP method of the request. For example: `GET`. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |
| `${request_uri}` | The complete URI of the request, with arguments (query string). | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |
| `${scheme}` | The scheme of the request. For example: `http` or `https`. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |
| `${sent_http_name}` | The value of the response header field name. The name argument must be converted to lowercase and the hyphens must be converted to underscore. For example: `${sent_http_content_length}` will take the value of the Content-Length header. | Response Phase |
| `${status}` | Status code of the response. | Response Phase |
| `${upstream_addr}` | The IP address and port of the queried origin for obtaining the response. If many origins are consulted during the processing of the request, the addresses will be separated by a comma. For example: `192.168.1.1:80, 192.168.1.2:80`. If an internal redirect from one group of servers to another occurs, initiated by an `X-Accel-Redirect` or an error page, the addresses of the different groups will be separated by a colon. For example: `192.168.1.1:80, 192.168.1.2:80 : 192.168.10.1:80, 192.168.10.2:80`. | Response Phase |
| `${upstream_cookie_name}` | Value of cookie name sent by the origin using the Set-Cookie header field. If many origins are consulted while the request is processed, only cookies from the last origin are stored. | Response Phase |
| `${upstream_http_name}` | Value of the name header field sent by the origin. The name argument must be converted to lowercase and the hyphens must be converted to underscore. If many origins are consulted while the request is processed, only headers from the last origin are stored. For example: `${upstream_http_server}` will assume the value of the Server header field sent by the last queried origin. | Response Phase |
| `${upstream_status}` | Status code of the origin response sent to RTM. If many origins are consulted while the request is processed, the status codes will be separated by a comma. If an internal redirect from one group of servers to another is initiated by an `X-Accel-Redirect` or an error page, the status codes of the different groups will be separated by a colon. | Response Phase |
| `${uri}` | The normalized (urldecoded) URI of the request. The value of `${uri}` can change during the processing of a request, for example, when an internal redirect occurs or when index files are used. For query string parameters, use `${request_uri}`. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase |

### Comparison Operators

| Operator | Description | Argument type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| is equal | The value of the variable is exactly the same as the argument. | string |
| is not equal | The value of the variable isn't the same as the argument. | string |
| starts with | The value of the variable starts with the argument. | string |
| does not start with | The value of the variable doesn't start with the argument. | string |
| matches | The value of the variable matches the regular expression entered as an argument. | regular expression |
| does not match | The value of the variable doesn't match the regular expression entered as an argument. | regular expression |
| exists | The variable has a defined value. For example: `${arg_search}` exists if a search argument was sent in the request query string. | - |
| does not exist | The variable doesn't have a defined value. For example: `${arg_search}` doesn't exist if a search argument wasn't sent in the request query string. | - |

### Logical Operators

Multiple criteria can be defined using the logical operators **AND** and **OR**. Each rule can have up to 10 criteria.

The operator **AND** has implicit precedence over the operator **OR**. If explicit precedence is required, you can add more criteria groups using the **AND** operator only.

---

## Behaviors

In the **Behaviors** section of the **Rules Engine**, you must add the behaviors you want your rule to perform if the conditions defined in the criteria are met.

For example, this behavior redirects the user to an English version of an FAQ location:

|  Behavior  | Argument |
| --- | --- |
| Redirect To (302 Found) | `/en-us/faq` |

Each rule can perform up to 10 behaviors.

Each behavior has its own set of requirements, described in the table below.

| Behavior | Description | Phase | Requirements |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Add Request Cookie | Adds a cookie in the `Set-Cookie` request header. The cookie must be inputted as an argument in the format `cookie-name=cookie-value`. <br />You may use a variable as a cookie value, for example: `cookie-name=${arg_cookie}`. | Request Phase | [Application Acceleration](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/application-acceleration/) |
| Add Response Cookie | Adds a cookie and policies in the `Set-Cookie` response header. The cookie must be inputted as an argument in the format `cookie-name=cookie-value`.<br />For response cookies, the following [Set-Cookie policies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie) can be added to the argument, following the cookie value and a semicolon (`;`):<br /><li>`Expires=date` (EEE, d MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss Z)</li><li>`Domain=domain-value`</li><li>`Path=path-value`</li><li>`Max-age=number` (TTL in seconds, takes precedence over `Expires`)</li><li>`SameSite=value; Secure`</li><li>`HttpOnly`</li><br />Multiple policies for the same cookie can be separated by semicolons (`;`). For example: `cookie-name=cookie-value; Domain=domain-value; Path=path-value; SameSite=value`.<br />You may also use variables as a cookie or policy value, for example: `Path=${uri}; Domain=${host}`. | Response Phase | [Application Acceleration](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/application-acceleration/) |
| Add Request Header | Adds a header field to the request that will be sent to the origin. The header field must be informed as an argument in the format `Field:value` | Request Phase | - |
| Add Response Header | Adds a header field to the response that will be sent to the user. The header field must be informed as an argument in the format `Field: value`. | Response Phase | - |
| Bypass Cache | Defines that Azion shouldn't cache the response from its origin. The execution of this rule has no impact on the cache in the users’ browser, which must be defined using the *Set Cache Policy* behavior. | Request Phase | [Application Acceleration](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/application-acceleration/) |
| Capture Match Groups | Support behavior for handling strings. Stores in a temporary variable the result of capturing correspondence groups defined by a regex applied to one of the available HTTP request fields. This temporary variable can be referenced later in the behavior *Rewrite Request* to assemble the rewrite string.<br />This behavior requires three arguments:<br />*captured array name*: the name you want to give the temporary variable where the array of captured strings will be stored.<br />*subject*: the HTTP request field where you want to capture a string.<br />*regex*: the regular expression used to capture the strings. Each captured group must be represented in parentheses.<br /><br />For example, to capture the path and name of a file in an HTTP request, you could use:<br />*captured array name:* `capture`<br />*subject:* `${uri}`<br />*regex:* `^(./)([^/])$`<br /><br />You may reference the capture variable as an array by using the notation `%{variable[index]}`. Because it's a local variable, you can only use it within the same rule you are setting up. In this example, if the URI is `/path/image.jpg`, the capture variable will have the following values:<br />`%{capture[0]} = “/path/image.jpg”`<br />`%{capture[1]} = “/path/”`<br />`%{capture[2]} = “image.jpg”`<br /><br />You can also name the indexes to reference them using names instead of a numeric index. To do so, use the `?&lt;name&gt;` notation as in the example:<br />*captured array name:* `capture`<br />*subject:* `${uri}`<br />*regex:* `^(?<path>.*/)(?<filename>[^/]*)$` | Request Phase | [Application Acceleration](/documentation/products/edge-application/application-acceleration/) |
| Deliver | Finishes processing the request and delivers the content to the user, without executing any of the rules added later. You are forcing the processing to end immediately. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase | - |
| Deny (403 Forbidden) | Delivers a *403 Forbidden* page to the user. Ends the request processing. | Request Phase | - |
| Enable Gzip | Enables Gzip data compression, if supported by the user’s browser. See the guide on [How to enable gzip compression](/en/documentation/products/guides/using-gzip-mime-types/) for more information. | Request Phase<br />Response Phase | - |
| Enable Sliced Files | Enables segmentation of large objects into 1MB slices, if their origin supports HTTP range requests. You can use this behavior to optimize the performance of your website or application; if you deliver media larger than 1MB through the CDN so that the content reaches users before Azion has received the entire object from its origin.<br /><br />When activating this functionality, Azion will request the objects for their origin via range requests and they'll be cached in Azion with [Advanced Cache Key](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-caching/#advanced-cache-key).<br /><br />If your origin doesn't support range requests, Azion will only be able to start delivering your content to its users after your origin has completed the complete sending of the object. | Default Rule | - |
| Enforce HLS cache | This behavior is automatically included by Azion whenever you select a Live Ingest origin. Performs two actions: the bypass of all your Cache Phase rules and the imposition of the cache policy defined by Azion for live transmissions in HTTP Live Streaming (HLS).<br /><br />Azion’s cache policy for live HLS streams is 5 seconds of cache for playlists (.m3u8) and 60 seconds of cache for chunks (.ts). | Request Phase | Live Ingest |
| Filter Request Cookie | Removes a cookie from the request header that would be sent to the origin. As an argument, add the name of the cookie you want to remove as `cookie-name`.<br /><br />To remove only specific values, you must inform the name and value of the cookie as `cookie-name=cookie-value`. | Request Phase | [Application Acceleration](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/application-acceleration/) |
| Filter Response Cookie | Removes a cookie from the request header that would be sent to the user. As an argument, add the name of the cookie you want to remove as `cookie-name`.<br /><br />To remove only specific values, you must inform the name and value of the cookie as `cookie-name=cookie-value`. | Response Phase | [Application Acceleration](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/application-acceleration/) |
| Filter Request Header | Removes a request header that would be sent to the origin. The name of the header field must be entered as an argument, for example: `Header-Name`. | Request Phase | - |
| Filter Response Header | Removes a response header that would be sent to the user. The name of the header field must be entered as an argument, for example: `Header-Name`. | Response Phase | - |
| Forward Cookies | By using the Forward Cookies behavior, you are determining that Azion forwards to the users the Set-Cookie header received from its origin, even in a cache content situation (cache hit).<br /><br />To prevent a user from receiving another user’s `Set-Cookie` session, see the [guide on Forward Cookies](/en/documentation/products/guides/edge-caching/#forward-cookies). | Request Phase | [Application Acceleration](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/application-acceleration/) |
| Optimize Images | Enables [Image Processor](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/image-processor/). | Request Phase | [Image Processor](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/image-processor/) |
| Redirect HTTP to HTTPS | Redirects the HTTP request to the respective HTTPS URL. If the request is already HTTPS, it doesn't execute any behavior. | Request Phase | HTTPS application. |
| Redirect To (301 Moved Permanently)<br /><br />Redirect To (302 Found) |These behaviors redirect the user to another URL entered as an argument, returning the status code *301 Moved Permanently* or *302 Found*.<br /><br />It is recommended that these behaviors be used for path changes; *301 Moved Permanently* for permanent changes and *302 Found* for temporary changes.<br /><br />This behavior ends the request processing.<br /><br />**Warning**: in the Response Phase, Redirect To behaviors are only executed when the origin returns a 404 error. | Request Phase <br />Response Phase | - |

### Bypass Cache

You can also use Azion to deliver your dynamic and personalized content, even when some of your content can't be cached in Azion's infrastructure. You define cache rules per path. You can create a **Bypass Cache** rule for the paths of your website that won't be cached in Azion's infrastructure.

By using Bypass Cache, you'll configure Azion's service to forward all requests to a path directly to their origin. However, you'll count on important protocol optimizations to speed up your application and a keepalive connection between Azion edge nodes and their origin whenever possible.

> See the guide on [How to configure cache policies for Edge Application](/en/documentation/products/guides/edge-caching/#bypass-cache) for more information on Bypass Cache.

#### Difference between Bypass Cache and TTL 0

While both the **Bypass Cache** behavior and **Maximum TTL** at zero seconds allow you to optimize content delivery and reduce load times at the origin, their effects are a bit different.

By using the Bypass Cache behavior, all HTTP and HTTPS requests received by Azion's edge nodes will be sent to the origin, without caching any content. Use Bypass Cache if you want to deliver different content for each user request.

However, when setting TTL to 0 (zero) seconds, multiple requests in parallel to Azion's edge nodes will be sent as a single request to their origin. In this case, Azion's edge nodes also validate changes to the content with its origin by using the *If-Modified-Since* parameter. If the object hasn't changed since the last request, the content won't need to be transferred again, which could result in a much faster *304 Not Modified* response. Also, setting maximum cache TTL to 0 will still generate a cache object that lives for 999 milliseconds.

:::tip
You can set TTL to zero if the dynamic content, which varies from time to time, can be delivered identically to all users who make simultaneous requests.
:::

### Forward Cookies

If your origin manages application cookies, you may need the **Forward Cookies** functionality. By default, Azion filters the Response Header `Set-Cookie` sent by the origin. If you wish, you can configure Azion so that `Set-Cookie` is passed on to your users.

By using the Forward Cookies functionality, you're determining that Azion forwards the `Set-Cookie` header received from your origin, even in a cache hit. To prevent a user from receiving another user's `Set-Cookie` session, you must list all session cookies (private cookies) your application must ignore using the [Advanced Cache Key](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/cache-settings/#advanced-cache-key).

> See the guide on [How to configure cache policies for Edge Application](/en/documentation/products/guides/edge-caching/#forward-cookies) for more information on Forward Cookies.

#### JavaScript Cookies

An alternative to sending the response header `Set-Cookie` is to create cookies using **JavaScript**, which allows you to create, read, and expire cookies through the `document.cookie` property.

A [JavaScript cookie](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_cookies.asp) should have the following format:

```js
document.cookie = “username=John Doe; expires=Thu, 18 Dec 2020 12:00:00 UTC; path=/”;
```

By default, Azion won't filter the request header `Cookie` regardless of its **Forward Cookies** configuration and therefore JavaScript Cookies may be sent to the origin to enable the management of your application.

---

## Functions

For behaviors that request a mandatory argument, you can use the same variables available for both processing phases. This way, you can compose cookies or HTTP headers via a Response using data collected from a Request, such as the user's device group or their geolocation.

Azion also provides some functions to simplify the handling of your arguments:

| Function and Argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `${cookie_time_offset(number)}` | Returns the current date plus an offset in seconds, entered as an argument, to be used to define the expiration time of a cookie. For example, if you want the cookie to expire in 1 hour, use the *Add Response Cookie* behavior with the argument: `cookie-name=cookie-value; Expires=${cookie_time_offset(3600)}` |
| `${encode_base64(string)}` | Returns the arguments coded in base64. For example: `${encode_base64(http://www.yourdomain.com/)}` will return the value `d3d3LmRvbWFpbi5jb20K` |

## Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) variables

Add those variables inside the **Rules Engine** of your edge application to configure **Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS)**.

Find out more about [support for mTLS](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/domains/mtls/) and the difference between *Enforce (standard)* and *Permissive* modes.
```
| Variable                   | Description                                                                                                                       | Phase   |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `${ssl_client_fingerprint}`  | Returns the Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1) of the client certificate.                                                            | Request |
| `${ssl_client_escaped_cert}` | Returns the client certificate in Private Enhanced Mail (PEM) format as URL encoded string.                                       | Request |
| `${ssl_client_s_dn}`         | Returns the "subject DN" string of the client certificate.                                                                        | Request |
| `${ssl_client_s_dn_parsed}`  | Returns the extracted "subject CN" value of the client certificate.                                                               | Request |
| `${ssl_client_cert}`         | Returns the client certificate (PEM format). This variable is deprecated. Use `$ssl_client_escaped_cert` instead.                 | Request |
| `${ssl_client_i_dn}`         | Returns the "issuer DN" string of the client certificate.                                                                         | Request |
| `${ssl_client_serial}`       | Returns the serial number of the client certificate.                                                                              | Request |
| `${ssl_client_v_end}`        | Returns the end date (expiration date) of the client certificate.                                                                 | Request |
| `${ssl_client_v_remain}`     | Returns the number of days until the client certificate expires.                                                                  | Request |
| `${ssl_client_v_start}`      | Returns the start date of the client certificate.                                                                                 | Request |
| `${ssl_client_verify} `      | Returns the result of the client certificate verification. It can be `SUCESS`, `FAILED:reason`, or `NONE`.                        | Request |
```
  
> **Tip**: most mTLS services rely on receiving the user certificate. Using [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com), you can send the `${ssl_client_escaped_cert}` variable as a Request Header (known as X-Forward-Client-Cert [XFCC]) to the origin, then configure your edge application to use this header with the certificate data.

## Debugging rules

You can debug rules created in **Rules Engine for Edge Application** through the **GraphQL API**, **Data Streaming**, or **Real-Time Events**.

See [How to debug rules created with Rules Engine](/en/documentation/products/guides/debug-rules/) for detailed information and instructions on how to activate and use this functionality.
