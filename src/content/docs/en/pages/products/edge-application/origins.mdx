With **Origins**, you can customize the origins for your content, customize the `Host` Header, connection method, and authentication credentials.

An origin represents the server from which Azion retrieves your content. 

---

## Origin Type

There are two options for you to customize your origin:

- **Single Origin**: create multiple one **Address** each path.
- **Load Balancer**: add multiple **Addressess** and determine load weight and server role.

Find out more about [Load Balancer](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/load-balancer/).

---

## Host Header

The `Host` header is used by your origin to identify the *virtualhost* and locate your content or application. When configuring an origin in [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/), you have the option to customize the value sent by Azion in the `Host` header.

If the **Host Header** field is left blank, Azion will use the same address specified in the **Address** field as the default. If your origin is configured to respond to a *virtualhost* using the same address as configured in DNS, you can leave the **Host Header** field empty.

However, if your origin responds to a *virtualhost* at an address different from the one set in DNS, you must fill in a custom value for the `Host` header in FQDN format, for example, `www.yourdomain.com`.

:::caution
Customizing the `Host` header is essential if your origin responds to a *virtualhost* at an address other than the one configured in DNS.
:::

Alternatively, you can use the `${host}` variable in the **Host Header** field to instruct the edge nodes to pass on the `Host` header received from your visitors to the origin. This setting is useful if you have multiple *virtualhosts* being served by the same origin.

---

## Origin Path

**Origin Path** allows you to specify a custom path from which edge nodes will request your origin content. Azion appends the **Origin Path** to the URI when forwarding the request to your origin, but it does not append the URI for user requests. For instance, if you determine that the path of your origin is under `/secure` and you have configured your application to be delivered through `yourdomain.com`, the `/secure` path will not be part of the request to the end user.

:::caution
The definition of an **Origin Path** is optional. If not specified, only the root URI will be considered.

## Address

To define an origin for your content, you need to specify the address of your server, either as a domain name in FQDN format or in IPv4/IPv6. If your origin uses non-standard ports (other than 80/HTTP and 443/HTTPS), you can indicate the domain:port notation in this field.

Additionally, after completing the above fields, you can add an origin by providing its IP address or hostname FQDN (*Full Qualified Domain Name*). If you have defined the *Origin Protocol Policy* as *Enforce HTTP* or *Enforce HTTPS*, you have the option to customize the origin port using the notation `host:port`.

---

## Origin Protocol Policy

Azion’s delivery architecture allows you to customize the desired type of connection of the Edge Nodes to your origin:

- **Preserve HTTP/HTTPS protocol**: keeps the same connection protocol - *HTTP or HTTPS* - and ports used by your user when accessing your content on Azion to connect to your origin.
- **Enforce HTTP**: the connection between Azion’s Edge Nodes and your origin will be through HTTP, regardless of the connection protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) and ports used by your user to access Azion’s content. With this new option, you may customize a port to your origin in the **Address** field different from the default port (80 for HTTP) if you wish.
- **Enforce HTTPS**: the connection between Azion’s Edge Nodes and your origin will be through HTTPS, regardless of the connection protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) and ports used by your user to access Azion’s content. With this new option, you may customize a port to your origin in the **Address** field different from the default port (443 for HTTPS) if you wish.


### HMAC Authentication 

You may include a Single Origin where the origin is found in an Object Storage with private access, with authentication through HMAC.

When enabling *HMAC Authentication*, your private content will begin to be delivered to your users through Edge Application.You should include in the access credentials HMAC, Region, Access Key and Secret Key provided by your Object Storage provider. 

Secret Key is protected by being displayed only to its users with write permission and maintaining their access security.

### Timeouts 

Displays timeout setting in seconds pre-defined by Azion. Timeout values cannot be customized.
