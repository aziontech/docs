**Edge Caching** is a module available for **Edge Application** that reduces latency and enables a high transfer rate through Azion's network of edge nodes.

When your content is successfully cached, also known as a *cache hit*, it can be directly delivered to your users from edge node nearest to them, eliminating the frequency of access to your origin servers. This not only enhances performance and scalability for your content but also cuts back on infrastructure costs.

In the event of a *cache miss*, where the requested content is not available in the cache, Azion's Edge Caching module minimizes the impact by maintaining a keep-alive connection with the origin server whenever possible. This approach avoids the overhead of frequent TCP/IP handshakes. Irrespective of the number of simultaneous requests made to Azion's Edge Nodes, each edge node will only need to search the content from the origin once per cache miss. As a result, this substantially reduces the load on your infrastructure caused by cache misses.

If origin servers experience downtime or becomes unavailable, Azion's Edge Caching can also serve content to your users by delivering stale cache from the edge.

## Expiration settings

With Edge Caching, can customize both browser cache TTL (Time-to-Live) and edge cache TTL according to your specific requirements.

By setting your TTL for browser cache, you can control how long the content remains stored on local browsers. A longer TTL can reduce the need for users to fetch content from the edge or origin servers, improving load times and reducing bandwidth usage. However, it's essential to balance the TTL length to ensure users receive fresh content when updates occur.

You can also define how long your content should remains cached on Azion's edge nodes. A longer edge cache TTL can enhance content delivery performance, as frequently accessed content remains available closer to users, reducing the load on the origin server. Again, striking the right balance is crucial to ensure users receive the most up-to-date content without serving stale cache for too long.

The ability to customize both the browser cache TTL and edge cache TTL allows you to fine-tune your caching strategy based on your content's update frequency, user traffic patterns, and overall performance objectives.

## Stale Cache

**Stale Cache** allows your application to deliver expired content in cache whenever origin servers are unavailable.

When your application's cache expires, it becomes *stale* (obsolete) and the server searches the source for the most up-to-date version. This new version, with an updated expiration date, overwrites the old one (*stale*).

However, the server may encounter problems and be unable to get the most up-to-date version of your application from the origin. In such cases, it delivers the latest version of it, even though it has expired. This behavior is known as **Stale Cache**.

## Adaptive Delivery 

**Adaptive Delivery** detects device groups you have created using [Device Groups](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/device-groups/), allowing you to configure how Azion delivers your content. You may chose to deliver the same version of the content, regardless of device detection or keep device-based variations of objects in cache.
