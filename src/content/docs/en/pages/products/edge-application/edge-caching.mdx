**Edge Caching** is a module available for **Edge Application** that reduces latency and enables a high transfer rate through Azion's network of edge nodes.

## Implementation

## Stale Cache

**Stale Cache** allows your application to deliver expired content in cache whenever origin servers are unavailable.

When your application's cache expires, it becomes *stale* (obsolete) and the server searches the source for the most up-to-date version. This new version, with an updated expiration date, overwrites the old one (*stale*).

However, the server may encounter problems and be unable to get the most up-to-date version of your application from the origin. In such cases, it delivers the latest version of it, even though it has expired. This behavior is known as **Stale Cache**.

## Adaptive Delivery 

**Adaptive Delivery** detects device groups you have created using [Device Groups](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/device-groups/), allowing you to configure how Azion delivers your content. You may chose to deliver the same version of the content, regardless of device detection or keep device-based variations of objects in cache.
