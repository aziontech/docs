**L2 Caching** is an **Edge Application** that creates an additional cache layer between the edge and your origin servers, reducing latency and infrastructure costs.

:::note
L2 Caching is only available if the service has been activated for your account. To activate **L2 Caching**, [contact the Sales team](https://www.azion.com/en/contact-sales/).
:::

When accessing your applications on Azion, your end-user accesses the edge network, where your content is cached. By enabling L2 Caching in your edge applications, you can:

- cache at a second layer at the edge.
- keep your content cached for longer periods of time.
- select the best region to keep cache closer to your users.

## Recommended TTL

**L2 Caching** is specially designed for objects that can remain in cache for a long period of time. Thus, you can only activate it on cache policies with a TTL equal to or greater than *3 seconds*, with the default TTL being *60 seconds*.

---

## Regions

When using **L2 Caching** as an additional caching layer, you must select a server region. For example: `sa-brazil` for Brazil, `na-united-states` for the USA, etc., depending on the region.

---

## Bypass cache

The L2 Caching module currently doesn't support bypass cache. You can [configure a Bypass Cache rule](/en/documentation/products/guides/edge-caching/#bypass-cache) for caching at the edge, but applications with active L2 cache settings will continue to keep caching in that layer for the specified TTL.

Find out more about [Bypass cache](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/rules-engine/#bypass-cache).

---

## Real-Time Purge

Whenever necessary, you can use **Real-Time Purge** to expire your L2 Caching content before the expected TTL time. Remember to purge first in L2 and only later in **Edge Caching**. This avoids edge feedback with outdated L2 content.

> **Warning**: the **Honor Origin** setting isn't available for CDN Cache. You need to set a TTL to overwrite the CDN cache.
