**L2 Caching** is an **Edge Application** module that creates an additional cache layer between the edge and your origin servers, reducing latency and infrastructure costs.

When accessing your applications on Azion, your end-user accesses the edge network, where your content is cached. By enabling L2 Caching in Edge Application, you can:

- Cache at a second layer at the edge.
- Keep your content cached for longer periods of time.
- Select the best region to keep cache closer to your users.

:::note
L2 Caching is only available if the service has been activated for your account. To activate **L2 Caching**, [contact the Sales team](https://www.azion.com/en/contact-sales/).

## Recommended TTL

**L2 Caching** is specially designed for objects that can remain in cache for a long period of time. Thus, you can only activate it on cache policies with a TTL equal to or greater than *3 seconds*, with the default TTL being *60 seconds*.

## Regions

When using **L2 Caching** as an additional caching layer, you must select a server region. The available regions are:

- Brazil: `sa-brazil`
- US: `na-united-states`

---

## Real-Time Purge

Whenever necessary, you can use **Real-Time Purge** to expire your L2 Caching content before the expected TTL time. Remember to purge first in L2 and only later in **Edge Caching**. This avoids edge feedback with outdated L2 content.

## Limits

### Bypass cache

The **L2 Caching** module currently doesn't support bypass cache. You can [configure a Bypass Cache rule](/en/documentation/products/guides/edge-caching/#bypass-cache) for caching at the edge, but applications with active L2 cache settings will continue to keep caching in that layer for the specified TTL.
