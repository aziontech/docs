The **WebSocket** module for **Edge Application** allows you to establish the WebSocket communication protocol between your origin and your users. It consists of a single bidiractional TCP connection, allowing data to be exchanged in real-time through a single handshake without the need to relaunch the connection.

WebSockets are designed to minimize latency and enhance efficiency, and they're best suited for interactive applications like online games, chat platforms, real-time notifications, and live streaming services. See the [WebSocket Protocol specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455) for more information.

> This module is available only for **Mission Critical** and **Enterprise** plans. For more detailed information about Azion service plans, access the [Pricing page](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/).

Due to their nature as an open connection, WebSocket connections do not support [Edge Functions](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-functions/). In addition, WebSocket connections won't cache at the edge or at the [Layer 2](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/l2-caching/).

## Requirements

WebSockets must be supported by your architecture and origin servers for the protocol to be implemented in your edge applications. The majority of modern web browsers include native WebSocket support.

## Debugging

To verify whether a WebSocket connection has been established, the HTTP headers `Upgrade: websocket` and `Connection: upgrade` must be present in the initial request and response.

## Connection termination

Although the connection is persistent, it can be terminated if it hits the maximum connection TTL. If a WebSocket upgrade request is unsuccessful or is terminated, the application or the browser must support reconnection.
