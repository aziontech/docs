The **WebSocket** module for **Edge Application** allows you to establish the WebSocket communication protocol between your application and your users. It consists of a single bidiractional and persistent TCP connection, allowing real-time, full-duplex communication between clients and servers. 

WebSocket is designed to minimize latency and enhance efficiency, and it is best suited for interactive applications like online games, chat platforms, and live streaming services.

This module is available only for **Mission Critical** and **Enterprise** plans. For more detailed information about Azion service plans, [access here](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/)
