The **WebSocket** module for **Edge Application** allows you to establish the WebSocket communication protocol between your origin and your users. It consists of a single bidirectional TCP connection, allowing data to be exchanged in real time through a single handshake without the need to relaunch the connection.

WebSockets are designed to minimize latency and enhance efficiency, and they're best suited for real-time applications like online games, chat platforms, notifications, and live streaming services. See the [WebSocket Protocol specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455) for more information.

:::note
This module is available only for **Mission Critical** and **Enterprise** plans. For more detailed information about Azion service plans, access the [Pricing page](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/).

Due to their nature as an open connection, WebSocket connections don't support [Edge Functions](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-functions/). In addition, WebSocket connections won't cache at the edge or at the [L2 Caching](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/l2-caching/) layer.

## Requirements

WebSockets must be supported by your architecture and origin servers for the protocol to be implemented in your edge applications.

Client-side, the majority of modern web browsers include native WebSocket support. See the full list of [WebSocket browser support](https://caniuse.com/websockets).

## Debugging

When you enable the WebSocket module for Edge Application, requests to your application may occur through the `ws://` or `wss://` protocols. To verify whether a WebSocket connection has been successfully established, the HTTP headers `Upgrade: websocket` and `Connection: upgrade` must be present in the initial request and response.

## Connection termination

Although the connection is persistent, it can be terminated if it hits the maximum connection TTL. If a WebSocket upgrade request is unsuccessful or is terminated, the application at the origin or the browser must support reconnection.
