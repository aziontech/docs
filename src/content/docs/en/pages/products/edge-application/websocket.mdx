The **WebSocket** module for **Edge Application** allows you to establish the WebSocket communication protocol between [your application and your USERS/ORIGIN]. It consists of a single bidiractional and persistent TCP connection, allowing data to be exchanged in real-time through a single handshake withouth the need to relaunch the connection.

WebSockets are designed to minimize latency and enhance efficiency, and it is best suited for interactive applications like online games, chat platforms, and live streaming services. See the [WebSocket Protocol specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455) for more information.

This module is available only for **Mission Critical** and **Enterprise** plans. For more detailed information about Azion service plans, access the [Pricing page](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/).

## Requirements

To establish a WebSocket connection, your architecture and origin servers must support WebSockets. Most modern browsers also offer WebSocket support.

## Connection reliability (?)

If a WebSocket upgrade request is unsuccessful, the client or origin must support reconnection.
