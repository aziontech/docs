**Edge Application** is a product that lets you build web applications on Azion Edge Network, reducing latency and throughput between origin servers and users. You can define how your content will be cached, execute functions and business rules, and optimize content delivery for your users.

> Learn how to create an edge application in the [getting started](/en/documentation/products/getting-started/) guide.

---

## How it works

**Edge Application** works with a reverse proxy architecture. When you build an application in [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/) and point the traffic from your domain to Azion, your users will access your application through our highly distributed global network of edge nodes.

> See the [documentation on Domains](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/domains/) for more information on how to associate a domain to an edge application.

Then, Azion selects which edge node closest to the user can handle the request, reducing latency and speeding up content transfer and downloads.

In this architecture, your content or web application has to be available from an origin, which can be one or more web servers in your infrastructure, a cloud service, or one of Azion Origin Services.

> See the documentation on [Single Origin](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/single-origin/) and [Load Balancer](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/load-balancer/) to find out more about how to set up one or multiple origins.

## Edge Caching

Through Edge Caching, Azion's highly distributed global network allows you to deliver your content much more efficiently. Content that is successfully cached – cache hit – on Azion's edge nodes can be delivered directly to your users from the nearest Edge Node, without having to access the origin. In addition to increasing performance and scalability for your content, you can reduce costs on your origin infrastructure.

A cache miss occurs when content is requested and it isn't in cache. The Edge Caching module minimizes the effect of cache miss by maintaining a keep-alive connection with the origin whenever possible, avoiding the overhead of the TCP/IP handshake. Regardless of the volume of simultaneous requests made to Azion's Edge Nodes, each Edge Node will search the content at the origin only once per cache miss, which substantially reduces the impact on your infrastructure.

## Delivery

### Delivery Protocols

You can customize the delivery of your application by choosing the following options:

- **HTTP**: delivers your application using only the HTTP protocol.
- **HTTP & HTTPS**: delivers your application using the HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

> If you choose to deliver your application through **HTTP & HTTPS**, you must define a **minimum TLS version** and set up [Digital Certificates](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/digital-certificates/) for your domain.

### Ports

Azion allows you to choose which HTTP and HTTPS ports your application will use. You must choose *at least one port* from the available ports for each protocol selected.

The **simultaneous multiport** solution allows you to choose from all available ports, including non-default ones, for simultaneous delivery.

#### List of available ports

| HTTP Port    | HTTPS Port     |
|--------------|----------------|
| 80 (default) | 443 (default)  |
| 8080         | 8443           |
| 8008         | 9440           |
|              | 9441           |
|              | 9442           |
|              | 9443           |

## Minimum TLS version

The **Transport Layer Security (TLS)** protocol allows you to encrypt web traffic. The following TLS versions can be used with edge applications:

- TLS 1.0 (*deprecated*)
- TLS 1.1 (*deprecated*)
- TLS 1.2
- TLS 1.3

You can choose the minimum version of TLS that will be supported by your edge application. By choosing recent versions of the protocol, older devices or browsers might not be able to access the edge application.

Azion blocks TLS Renegotiation and TLS Resumption by default. If you want to customize this setup, [contact our Sales team](https://www.azion.com/en/contact-sales/).

## Ciphers

Ciphers are cryptography algorithms utilized to encrypt *plaintext* into *ciphertext*, which requires a key to be decrypted. Azion gives you the possibility to change the *cipher suite* your edge application will use in order to protect your application against TLS attacks.

The cipher suite will determine which cryptographic algorithms will be used in the TLS connections of your edge application. Both, client and server, will *negotiate* the cipher suite to securely encrypt and decrypt the data exchanged during the session.

The table below shows the ciphers available in each cipher suite.

| Cipher                        | TLSv1.2_2018      | TLSv1.2_2019      | TLSv1.2_2021      | TLSv1.3_2022    |

## Limits

### Download rate

When downloading large files in edge applications through connections around 3MB/s or slower, download reset may occur. The **Azion Platform** terminates connections that exceed the maximum session duration (10 to 15 minutes) by default and prioritizes dynamic, low-latency edge applications over large file transfers. For smoother downloads, consider switching to faster and more stable connections or implementing [file slicing](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-caching/#slice-settings), [compression](/en/documentation/products/guides/using-gzip-mime-types/) and edge caching in your application. If unexpected connection resets remain, [contact our Support team](https://www.azion.com/en/support/).
