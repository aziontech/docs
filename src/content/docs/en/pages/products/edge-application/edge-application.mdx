**Edge Application** is an Azion product that allows you to build applications that run in Azion's edge network. By reducing latency and enhancing throughput, Edge Application optimizes your end-user experience by bringing your application closer to them.

By operating on a reverse proxy architecture, Edge Application allows you to create applications on the edge and direct traffic from your domain to Azion. Through this process, your users can effortlessly access your application via a highly distributed global network of edge nodes. Then, Azion selects which edge node closest to the user can handle the request.

Your content or application has to be available from one or several origins. This origin can consist of one or more web servers from your infrastructure, a cloud service, or one of Azion's **Origin** services.

With Edge Application, you can:

- Define how your content will be cached.
- Execute functions at the edge.
- Bring your business rules for any request or response.
- Optimize content and image delivery for your users.
- Customize origins and error pages.

<Button text ="Build your first edge application" href="/en/documentation/products/getting-started/"></Button>

You can create and manage edge applications using:

- [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).
- [Azion API](https://api.azion.com).
- [Azion CLI](/en/documentation/products/cli/).
- [Azion Terraform Provider](/en/documentation/products/terraform-provider/).

## Delivery Protocols

You can customize the delivery of your application by choosing the following options:

- **HTTP**: delivers your application using only the HTTP protocol.
- **HTTP & HTTPS**: delivers your application using both the HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

> If you choose to deliver your application through HTTP & HTTPS, you must define a minimum TLS version and set up digital certificates for your domain.

### HTTP/3 support

> HTTP/3 support is in early access. Contact the Sales team to enable this functionality for your account.

If you choose to deliver your application through **HTTP & HTTPS**, you can enable **HTTP/3 support**. Based on the QUIC protocol standard, HTTP/3 provides faster load vibes and lower latency when compared to previous versions.

When you enable HTTP/3 support, your edge applications can utilize this protocol version in compatible browsers only through *HTTP port 80* and *HTTPS port 443*, as well as *minimum TLS version 1.3*.

Upon a user's first request to an edge application with HTTP/3, the handshake and first response will be conducted using TCP and HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2. The response from this exchange will assign a value to the [Alt-Svc header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Alt-Svc) that indicates that the latest version of the protocol is available to the browser. If the browser supports HTTP/3, the QUIC protocol and HTTP/3 will be used, unless the cached response misses or expires.

### Ports

Azion offers a simultaneous multiport solution, which means you can customize through which HTTP and HTTPS ports your application will be delivered to. You must choose *at least one port* for each protocol, but you can select from all available ports for delivery.

> If you enable HTTP/3 support, multiport configuration will be overwritten to the default ports 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS. Simultaneous multiport isn't available for applications with HTTP/3 support.

#### Available ports

| HTTP Port | HTTPS Port |
| --- | --- |
| 80 (default) | 443 (default) |
| 8080 | 8443 |
| 8008 | 9440 |
|  | 9441 |
|  | 9442 |
|  | 9443 |

## Minimum TLS version

The **Transport Layer Security (TLS)** protocol allows you to encrypt web traffic. The following TLS versions can be used with edge applications:

- TLS 1.0 (*deprecated*)
- TLS 1.1 (*deprecated*)
- TLS 1.2
- TLS 1.3

You can choose the minimum version of TLS that will be supported by your edge application. By choosing recent versions of the protocol, older devices or browsers might not be able to access the edge application.

> If you enable HTTP/3 support, the minimum TLS version will be set to TLS 1.3.

Azion blocks TLS Renegotiation and TLS Resumption by default. If you want to customize this setup, [contact the Sales team](https://www.azion.com/en/contact-sales/).

## Ciphers

Ciphers are cryptography algorithms utilized to encrypt *plaintext* into *ciphertext*, which requires a key to be decrypted. Azion gives you the possibility to change the *cipher suite* your edge application will use in order to protect your application against TLS attacks.

The cipher suite will determine which cryptographic algorithms will be used in the TLS connections of your edge application. Both, client and server, will *negotiate* the cipher suite to securely encrypt and decrypt the data exchanged during the session.

The table below shows the ciphers available in each cipher suite.

| Cipher | TLSv1.2_2018 | TLSv1.2_2019 | TLSv1.2_2021 | TLSv1.3_2022 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 | ✔︎ | ✔︎ | ✔︎ | ✕ |
| TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 | ✔︎ | ✔︎ | ✔︎ | ✕ |
| TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 | ✔︎ | ✔︎ | ✔︎ | ✕ |
| ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 | ✔︎ | ✔︎ | ✔︎ | ✔︎ |
| ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384 | ✔︎ | ✔︎ | ✔︎ | ✔︎ |
| ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305 | ✔︎ | ✔︎ | ✔︎ | ✔︎ |
| ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 | ✔︎ | ✔︎ | ✔︎ | ✔︎ |

## Domains

Azion **Domains** provides you with the flexibility to use automatically generated domains or your own custom domains, allowing you to manage and deliver content effectively through your edge applications with support for secure connections over HTTP and HTTPS.

<Button text ="Learn more about Domains" href="/en/documentation/products/edge-application/domains/"></Button>

---

## Digital Certificates

With **Digital Certificates**, you can enhance the security of your HTTPS applications by binding a custom TLS certificate to your edge application.

<Button text ="Learn more about Digital Certificates" href="/en/documentation/products/edge-application/digital-certificates/"></Button>

---

## Real-Time Purge

Use **Real-Time Purge** to clear cached content from Azion's edge or from the [Layer 2](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/l2-caching/) to maintain content accuracy, reduce outdated content delivery, and deliver an optimal user experience on your edge application. 

<Button text ="Learn more about Real-Time Purge" href="/en/documentation/products/edge-application/real-time-purge/"></Button>

---

## Limits

### Keepalive timeout

Azion enforces a keepalive connection duration limit of 10 to 15 minutes between users and edge applications. To avoid the termination of active connections that require more time to complete, consider implementing [file slicing](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/cache-settings/#slice-settings) or [file compression](/en/documentation/products/guides/using-gzip-mime-types/) for large files to improve data transfer speeds.
