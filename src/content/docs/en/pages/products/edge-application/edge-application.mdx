**Edge Application** is an Azion product that allows you to build web applications that run in Azion’s Edge Network. By reducing latency and enhancing throughput, Edge Application optimizes your end-user experience by bringing the application closer to them.

Operating on a reverse proxy architecture, Edge Application allows you to create applications within [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/) and direct traffic from your domain to Azion. Through this process, your users can effortlessly access your web application via our highly distributed global network of edge nodes.

Then, Azion selects which edge node closest to the user can handle the request. In the edge layer, you can define how your content will be cached, execute functions and business rules, and optimize content delivery for your users.

Your content or web application has to be available from one or several origins. This origin can consist of one or more web servers from your infrastructure, a cloud service, or one of Azion's Origin Services.

> Start creating an edge application with the [getting started](/en/documentation/products/getting-started/) guide.

## Delivery Protocols

You can customize the delivery of your application by choosing the following options:

- **HTTP**: delivers your application using only the HTTP protocol.
- **HTTP & HTTPS**: delivers your application using both the HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

> If you choose to deliver your application through HTTP & HTTPS, you must define a minimum TLS version and set up Digital Certificates for your domain.

### HTTP/3 support

> HTTP/3 support is in early access. Contact our Sales team to enable this functionality for your account.

If you choose to deliver your application through **HTTP & HTTPS**, you can enable **HTTP/3 support**. Based on the QUIC protocol standard, HTTP/3 provides faster load vibes and lower latency when compared to previous versions.

When you enable HTTP/3 support, your edge applications can utilize this protocol version in compatible browsers only through *HTTP port 80* and *HTTPS port 443*, as well as *minimum TLS version 1.3*.

Upon a user's first request to an edge application with HTTP/3, the handshake and first response will be conducted using TCP and HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2. The response from this exchange will assign a value to the [Alt-Svc header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Alt-Svc) that indicates that the latest version of the protocol is available to the browser. If the browser supports HTTP/3, the QUIC protocol and HTTP/3 will be used, unless the cached response misses or expires.

### Ports

Azion offers a simultaneous multiport solution, which means you can customize through which HTTP and HTTPS ports your application will be delivered to. You must choose *at least one port* for each protocol, but you can select from all available ports for delivery.

> If you enable HTTP/3 support, multiport configuration will be overwritten to the default ports 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS. Simultaneous multiport is not available for applications with HTTP/3 support.

#### Available ports

| HTTP Port | HTTPS Port |
| --- | --- |
| 80 (default) | 443 (default) |
| 8080 | 8443 |
| 8008 | 9440 |
|  | 9441 |
|  | 9442 |
|  | 9443 |

## Minimum TLS version

The **Transport Layer Security (TLS)** protocol allows you to encrypt web traffic. The following TLS versions can be used with edge applications:

- TLS 1.0 (*deprecated*)
- TLS 1.1 (*deprecated*)
- TLS 1.2
- TLS 1.3

You can choose the minimum version of TLS that will be supported by your edge application. By choosing recent versions of the protocol, older devices or browsers might not be able to access the edge application.

> If you enable HTTP/3 support, the minimum TLS version will be set to TLS 1.3.

Azion blocks TLS Renegotiation and TLS Resumption by default. If you want to customize this setup, [contact our Sales team](https://www.azion.com/en/contact-sales/).

## Ciphers

Ciphers are cryptography algorithms utilized to encrypt *plaintext* into *ciphertext*, which requires a key to be decrypted. Azion gives you the possibility to change the *cipher suite* your edge application will use in order to protect your application against TLS attacks.

The cipher suite will determine which cryptographic algorithms will be used in the TLS connections of your edge application. Both, client and server, will *negotiate* the cipher suite to securely encrypt and decrypt the data exchanged during the session.

The table below shows the ciphers available in each cipher suite.

| Cipher | TLSv1.2_2018 | TLSv1.2_2019 | TLSv1.2_2021 | TLSv1.3_2022 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 | ✔︎ | ✔︎ | ✔︎ | ✕ |

Use [Domains](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/domains/) to direct the traffic of your edge application to a custom domain.

## Digital Certificates

With [Digital Certificates](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/digital-certificates/), you can add a custom certificate for your HTTPS application.

## Real-Time Purge

---

## Limits

### Download rate

When downloading large files in edge applications through connections around 3MB/s or slower, download reset may occur. The **Azion Platform** terminates connections that exceed the maximum session duration (10 to 15 minutes) by default and prioritizes dynamic, low-latency edge applications over large file transfers. For smoother downloads, consider switching to faster and more stable connections or implementing [file slicing](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-caching/#slice-settings), [compression](/en/documentation/products/guides/using-gzip-mime-types/) and edge caching in your application. If unexpected connection resets remain, [contact our Support team](https://www.azion.com/en/support/).
