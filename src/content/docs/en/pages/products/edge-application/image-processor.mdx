**Image Processor** is an **Edge Application** module that can apply filters to your images, as well as process them without any noticeable loss of visual quality. With Image Processor, you can speed up the transfer time of your content and improve user experience in your applications.

This module supports the following image formats:

- JPEG
- GIF
- PNG
- BMP
- ICO
- WEBP (for [compatible browsers](https://caniuse.com/%23search=webp))

Follow the *Bandwidth Saving* graph through [Real-Time Metrics](/en/documentation/products/real-time-metrics/) to monitor the traffic savings resulting from the processed images.

## Resize images

Starting with an original image from your library, **Image Processor** can create derived images on demand, in the size that best suits your page.

You can specify the required size as arguments in the query string using the the following key-value pair:

```
?ims=WidthxHeight
```

The following file `/image.jpg?ims=WidthxHeight` would be resized according to the set `Width` and `Height` parameters:

[![Image_Processor_1](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=880x)](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=880x)

### Auto-crop

By specifying both `Width` and `Height`, the image may be cropped automatically to fit the required size. The cropping is centered and can be either vertical or horizontal, depending on how well the original dimensions fit the specified dimensions.

By appending the query `?ims=400x400` to the image, it'll be resized to 400 by 400 pixels with auto-crop. For example:

[![Image_Processor_1](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=400x400)](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=400x400)

### Preserve aspect ratio

Aspect ratio can be preserved by keeping only one of the two parameters in the query string. You can preserve width by using `Widthx` calculating the corresponding height, or `xHeight` to specify only the height and calculate the corresponding width.

By changing the query of the image to `?ims=400x`, the height will be calculated automatically and the width will be set to 400 pixels:

[![Image_Processor_1](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=400x)](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_2.png?ims=400x)

Conversely, by using the query `?ims=x100`, the width will be calculated automatically, but the height will be set to 100 pixels:

[![Image_Processor_1](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=x100)](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=x100)

### Maintain original dimension

The value `orig` can be replaced to maintain the original dimension of the image without auto-cropping.

The following image has the appended query string `?ims=880xorig`, keeping the original height but setting the width to 880 pixels:

[![Image_Processor_2](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_2.png)](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_2.png)

---

## Resizing the image with fit-in 

Another way to resize an image is using fit-in:

```
ims=fit-in/WidthxHeight
```

Replace `Width` and `Height` with the cropped image dimensions in pixels.

The derived image will be resized to fit the area specified by `WidthxHeight`. The aspect ratio of the original image is preserved, and you can hide one of the values if you wish.

If the specified area is larger than the image dimensions, the image won't be enlarged. The dimensions specified as fit-in parameters represent the maximum size limits of the area the image can occupy. One or both dimensions of the image can be smaller than its boundaries.

**Example:**

`https://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=fit-in/400x400`
(maximum width of 400 pixels and maximum height of 400 pixels)

[![Image_Processor_1](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=fit-in/400x400)](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=fit-in/400x400)

---

## Cropping the image

The image cropping can be done by entering a start point (AxB) and an endpoint (CxD), as an argument in the Query String of the image URL:

```
ims=AxB:CxD
```

- `AxB` is the starting point for the crop indicates the coordinates, in pixels, of the upper-left corner of the area to be cropped.
- `CxD` is the endpoint for the crop indicates the coordinates, in pixels, form the bottom-right corner of the area to be cropped.

**Example:**

`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=430x20:910x730`
(initial coordinate at 430x20 pixels and final coordinate at 910x730 pixels)

## Changing image quality 

The **Image Processor** processes your images, reducing file size and transfer time. The default quality value used is 85%, which provides optimization without any noticeable loss of visual quality.

You can set a custom quality for your images using the filter:

```
filters:quality(Number)
```

`Number` must be a whole number between 0 and 100, which represents the level of quality you wish.

**Example:**

`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=filters:quality(100)`
(100% quality)

[![Image_Processor_1](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=filters:quality(100))](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=filters:quality(100))

`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=filters:quality(85)`
(85% quality)

[![Image_Processor_1](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=filters:quality(85))](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=filters:quality(85))

`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=filters:quality(15)`
(15% quality)

[![Image_Processor_1](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=filters:quality(15))](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=filters:quality(15))

> To confirm whether your image is being optimized, [inspect the page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools) using your browser and find the corresponding path in the image. In the URL's query string, the `ims=VALUExVALUE` field corresponds to the resolution loaded on the page.

The `ims` parameter also allows you to alter optimization, quality, and sizing as needed. To see the original file, you only need to remove the query string added in the URL.

> **Note**: if you insert a resolution larger than the original one, the IMS will display the image with the highest possible resolution.

## Adding a watermark to the image

To add watermarks to images using the **Image Processor**, use the following filter:

```
filters:watermark(ImageURL,X,Y,Alpha)
```

- `ImageURL` is the URL of the image that you wish to insert as a watermark. If the URL contains parentheses, they must be coded as `%28` for “(” and `%29` for “)”.
- `X` represents the horizontal position for the watermark's insertion. Positive numbers represent the offset, in pixels, from left edge to right edge, while negative numbers represent offset from right edge to left edge. You can use the value *center*, to center the watermark horizontally, or the value *repeat*, to fill the image horizontally with repetitions of the watermark.
- `Y` represents the vertical position for the watermark's insertion. Positive numbers represent the offset, in pixels, from top to bottom, while negative numbers represent the offset from bottom to top. You can use the value *center*, to center the watermark vertically, or the value *repeat*, to fill the image vertically with repetitions of the watermark.
- `Alpha` is the transparency of the watermark. It must be a number between 0 (completely opaque) and 100 (completely transparent).

**Example:**

`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=filters:watermark(http://yourdomain.com/watermark-image.png,-25,-10,50)`

---

## Converting image to another format

You can convert the image to another format using the filter:

```
filters:format(ImageFormat)
```

Where **ImageFormat** can be replaced by `webp`, `jpeg`, `gif` or `png`.

**Example:**

`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=filters:format(gif)`
(converts a JPEG image into GIF)

[![Image_Processor_1](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=filters:format(gif))](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=filters:format(gif))

---

## Filling Image

The **Image Processor** can also be used to create a derived image that is larger than the original, but instead of resizing it to the required size, you can fill the area with a custom color. Use the same [parameters as fit-in](#resize-with-fit-in) with the dimensions you want and the *fill* filter:

```
filters:fill(Color)
```

`Color` is the fill color, following the nomenclature and codes specified by [hexadecimal values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors).

**Example:**

`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=fit-in/400x400/filters:fill(gray)`

[![Image_Processor_1](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=fit-in/400x400/filters:fill(gray))](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=fit-in/400x400/filters:fill(gray))

`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=fit-in/400x400/filters:fill(008080)`

[![Image_Processor_1](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=fit-in/400x400/filters:fill(008080))](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=fit-in/400x400/filters:fill(008080))

`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=fit-in/400x400/filters:fill(00ffff)`

[![Image_Processor_1](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=fit-in/400x400/filters:fill(00ffff))](/assets/docs/images/image-processor/Image_Processor_1.png?ims=fit-in/400x400/filters:fill(00ffff))

## Combining filters

**Image Processor** allows you to combine the filters you want by separating each of them with `:`.

```
filters:filter1(arg1):filter2(arg2)
```

Where **filter1(arg1)** and **filter2(arg2)** are the filters you want to apply.

**Example:**

`http://yourdomain.com/image.jpg?ims=fit-in/400x400/filters:fill(gray):quality(100)`
