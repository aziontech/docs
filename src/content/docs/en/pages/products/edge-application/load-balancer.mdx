Azion **Load Balancer** is an edge application module designed to balance traffic across your origins, data centers, or cloud providers, mitigating network congestion and server overload. To achieve high levels of fault tolerance and performance, you need to ensure your content and applications will be available should there be any issues with your origin servers.

With Load Balancer, you can:

- distribute traffic across your origin servers.
- ensure availability of your content and applications even in case of incidents.
- choose between load balancing algorithms.
- create routing rules to balance HTTP and HTTPS requests.

## Implementation

| Scope | Resource |
| --- | --- |
| Origins | [Origins](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/single-origin/) |

## Balancing method

The balancing method defines how the load will be distributed among your origins.

### Round-Robin

Defines the balancing algorithm in rotation. It takes into account the volume of requests and not the time that each origin takes to respond. Each origin will receive a load in proportion to its weight in the round robin. Slower origins may accumulate more connections in parallel. 

### Least Connections

Keeps track of the number of active connections with each origin and always sends the next request to the origin with the fewest connections. Slower origins will receive fewer requests, while faster origins will be able to attend more requests sequentially. 

### IP Hash

Keeps track per user IP address and tries, whenever possible, to associate the same origin for each IP. |

## Addresses

With Load Balancer, you may add multiple addresses

---

## Weight

You may define a **Weight** for each address by assigning them a number from 1 to 10.

The weight sets the proportion of load that the origin will receive. The larger the weight, the more load the origin will handle. For example, if you set the weight of an origin to 3, it will receive 3 times more load than an origin with a weight set to 1.

---

## Server Role

If the balancing method you select is Round-Robin or Least connections, you can define a **Server Role** for each origin.

You can choose between the **Primary** or **Backup** role. Backup origins will act as *standby* origins and only receive the load if all Primary origins fail.

---

## Active

To remove a server from balance temporarily for maintenance, you can disable it by deselecting the **Active** switch.  At least one active origin is required for the content to be available.
