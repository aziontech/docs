**Real-Time Events** is an [Observe](/en/documentation/products/observe/) product that allows you to display data from your Azion Products and Services in real time. You can use Real-Time Events to perform complex searches and explore data from your Azion applications.

See the [Real-Time Events first steps](/en/documentation/products/real-time-events/first-steps/).

---

## Events storage

Real-Time Events stores events from the last *168 hours*, equivalent to 7 days. You're able to query data during that period.

---

## Data sources 

The first step to explore your data is choosing the **Data Source**, which represents the Azion product or service that generated the events.

When submitting a search, the data source represents the index from where you want to collect data.

Azion provides the following data sources:

### Data Streaming

If you have contracted the [Data Streaming](https://www.azion.com/pt-br/docs/produtos/data-streaming/) product, this data source will display the event records of sending the data to your endpoints.

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| $client_id | Unique Azion customer identifier. |
| $data_streamed | Amount of bytes that was streamed in the streaming (attempt/sink/send). |
| $endpoint_type | Endpoint type configured for sending data, such as: HTTP / HTTPS Post, Kafka, S3, etc. |
| $job_name | Unique Azion identification for naming the type of streaming created. Example: Data Streaming HTTP, Data Streaming WAF. |
| $status_code | The status code of the request, for example: 200. |

| Variables | Description |
| --- | --- |
| $asn | AS Number refers to Autonomous System Number Allocation which corresponds to a group of IP address networks managed by one or more network operators that have a clear and unique routing policy. Consulting the ASN Whois service for LACNIC, Azion’s ASN, for example, is AS52580.

## Time Filter

The Time Filter allows you to refine the event search result and is selected by default for **Last 15 minutes**. You have the option of filtering with the following time ranges:

- Last 15 minutes
- Last 30 minutes
- Last 1 hour
- Last 3 hours
- Last 6 hours
- Last 12 hours
- Last day
- Last 2 days
- Last 3 days
- Last 5 days
- Last 7 days
- Custom

By using the *Custom* field, you can also customize your search by selecting a time range during the last *168 hours*.

---

## Filter by

In the **Filter by** field, you can optionally filter your search results using a keyword or phrase.

When submitting a search with a blank **Filter by** field, you'll get all existing records in the data origin for the selected time filter.

The searches are restricted to a particular field, using the notation: `key='value'`, such as `status='200'`. In this case, you'll filter only the records which have these specified pair: value and key. As key, you can use the variables from the tables above. Note that each data source has its own list of variables.

> Time filter occurs by using the **Time Filter** or **Custom** fields, for this reason it isn't possible to use the `timestamp` key in the filter.

You may search for more complex field compositions. Use the notations AND, OR, and NOT in the search field to combine the fields, such as `status='200' AND scheme='https'`.

The **Filter by** field uses SQL language, therefore you must use “equals” (=) after the key and “single quotes” ( ' ) around values. For example: `status='200'`.

If you intend to search for a more generic value, you can use the “like” operator instead of “equals”, exactly like you use in SQL queries. The final query for this search can be `host like '%mydomain%'`.

---

## Refresh

The search always returns the results ordered by the time of the event, from most recent to oldest.

You can use the **Refresh** button to update the returned data, repeating the last search performed.

---

## Limits

Depending on the size of your data, the query limit may exceed. If this happens, filter by a short time filter.
