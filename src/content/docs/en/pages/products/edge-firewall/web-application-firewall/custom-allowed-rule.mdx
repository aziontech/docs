Azion **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** allows you to instantiate **Custom Allowed Rules** for your **edge applications**. 

Those rules can be created specifically for your needs, based on the actual application traffic and behavior.

You can create rules to amplify the security levels of your application and also to stop false positives.

When creating **Custom Allowed Rules** for a **WAF** configuration, it's necessary to choose between the available internal rules for its composition. 

See the list of all available internal rules below:

> **Warning**: requests that fall under rules 1 to 18 will be blocked, even if the WAF is operating in *learning* mode. Read the [Rules Engine for Edge Firewall](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/rules-engine/) documentation for the definition of learning/blocking modes. Read this guide [how to check your WAF mode](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-check-your-waf-mode/).
