Azion's **Edge Firewall** uses the [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/) internal access management system.

**Access permissions** gives you more confidence, security, and flexibility when defining functions and roles for users, as well as for groups of users.

Control what each user, or group of users, can view or edit within an Edge Firewall configuration.

User groups can have the following access permissions:

| Access                 | Permission                                                                                                                                                          |
