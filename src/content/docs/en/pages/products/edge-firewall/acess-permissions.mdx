description: Each user in Real-Time Manager can be associated with teams and, for each team, you can assign access permissions.

**Edge Firewall** uses [**Real-Time Manager**](https://manager.azion.com/) per-team permissions system. This way, you have more flexibility when defining the functions and roles of users and teams.

## Users and teams

The **Real-Time Manager** enables association between any user and a team. You can assign the following access permissions for each team:

| Access                 | Permission                                                                                                  |
