**Network Layer Protection** is an Edge Firewall module that allows you to create lists based on the network IP/CIDR, user location, or Autonomous System Number (ASN), or use automatic lists maintained and updated by Azion, such as a Tor network address list. 

With Network Layer Protection, you can monitor and block suspicious behavior or apply restrictions, such as access limits.

Network Layer Protection has a programmable security perimeter, where you configure Network Layer Protection, at the edge, from all inbound and outbound traffic.

## How Network Layer Protection works

When activating the **Network Layer Protection** module in the *Main Settings* of a Rule Set in **Edge Firewall**, the conditions (*Criteria*) and commands (*Behavior*) will be enabled in the **Rules Engine** tab of an Edge Firewall Rule Set.

> Learn more about [Edge Firewall](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/) configurations and [Edge Firewall Rule Sets](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/rules-engine/).

The Criteria available with the activation of the Network Layer Protection module are:

- Hostname
- Network
- Request URI
- Scheme

And the Behaviors are:

- Deny (403 forbidden)
- Drop (close without response)
- Set Rate Limit

Network Layer Protection configuration is done in the Edge Firewall **Rules Engine** tab. There, you can use the `Network` criteria, to create rules with [Network Lists](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/network-layer-protection/network-lists/), based on the network, user location, or ASN, or use ready-to-use lists that are kept up-to-date by Azion itself, such as the outbound addresses of the Tor Network *Azion IP Tor Exit Nodes*. You can also monitor and block suspicious behavior, or even apply restrictions according to the chosen behavior.

Activate other modules in the *Rule Set* to get numerous combinations of conditions and behavior in the *Rules Engine*.

Criteria and Behavior logic example using **Network Layer Protection** and **Web Application Firewall**:

Criteria: `If Network matches My-Country-BlockList and Header User Agent does not match Googlebot`.

Behavior: `Then Deny (403 Forbidden)`.

In this example, requests originating from countries that are on the blocklist will be blocked unless the user-agent header contains "Googlebot".

> The conditions and behaviors available in the Edge Firewall Rules Engine tab depend on the activated modules.

## Network Lists

Through **Network Lists**, you can create, search, or update the Network Lists used in the **Edge Firewall Rules Engine**.

Also, maintain your own lists in **Network Lists** via [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com) or [API](https://api.azion.com/). A single Network List can be associated with more than one Edge Firewall Rule or Rule Set. 

Whenever the Network List is updated, it'll automatically propagate to all the rules in the associated Network List. 

Learn more about [Network Lists](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/network-layer-protection/network-lists/).

> If you have a *Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)* or other security tools in your infrastructure, you can use the Network Lists to keep your *blocklists* and *allowlists* always up to date.

## Origin Shield 

**Origin Shield** is an Azion **Network Layer Protection** add-on. You will be able to create a security perimeter for your origin infrastructure, be it a *cloud*, *hosting* provider, or even your own *data center*. With this service, your origin will be able to restrict access only to specific IP addresses of our network and block any other access to your origin.

Azion's IP list may change frequently, but after updating it, the new servers will only be put into production for those using the Origin Shield add-on 7 days after the list is published. You can also track and trace the changes made to the list through the *History* of the **RTM**. There, you can find which IPs have been added or deleted from the list.

Our *quarantine* process allows you to add new addresses one week in advance, which means that whenever a new address is added to the list, it will be on standby for seven days before being activated, giving you that time to update your firewall rules.

> All Azion users with the product enabled are notified by email whenever the Origin Shield addresses change.
