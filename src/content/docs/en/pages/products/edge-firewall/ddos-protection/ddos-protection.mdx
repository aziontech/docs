Azion **DDoS Protection** protects your applications against *Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)* attacks.

The **DDoS Protection** module detects attacks using advanced algorithms that run on Azion’s distributed network. This distributed network connects to several mitigation centers to guarantee mitigation during large-scale attacks, both at the network and application levels.

Through a modern approach to detect and mitigate attacks from the network, transport and application layers, we reduce downtime without impacting the performance of your service.

See the **DDoS Protection** available options by logging into the **Real-Time Manager** and clicking **Account Menu** > **Billing & Subscriptions** > **Subscriptions**. You will see the **DDoS Protection** options in the Edge Firewall section.

## DDoS Protection - 5Gbps

When delivered over the Azion network, the **DDoS Protection** protects your content, web applications and APIs, from the most common DDoS attacks in the network and transport layers (layers 3 and 4), such as volumetric attacks, Slow Reads and SYN/ACK flood.

Your traffic is monitored in real time using anomaly analysis algorithms and traffic signatures to quickly detect and protect the availability of your content, with automatic attack mitigation, without impacting delivery latency.

### Cost and benefit

When using Azion, you benefit from **DDoS Protection**, our always-on protection against DDoS attacks, at no additional cost and with no need for any configuration or parameterization of the service. Your service will be protected against the most frequent DDoS attacks on the network and transport layers, up to a limit of 5Gbps. 

> For protection against attacks of any volume and for protection of your infrastructure, you need ***DDoS Protection - 20Gbps, 50Gbps, and Unlimited**.

### Integration and simplicity

All attack mitigation techniques are automated and built across Azion's content delivery network, offering you the protection you need against the most common attacks, without you having to configure or parameterize anything. Our distributed Points of Presence (POPs) and our global attack mitigation centers are prepared for large-scale global attacks, without you having to do anything.

### Always-on mitigation

Azion’s always-on **DDoS Protection** continuously monitors network flow by inspecting incoming traffic and using Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), in addition to advanced traffic analysis and signature algorithms, to detect and block malicious traffic in time and with no impact to your applications.

You can also mitigate DDoS attacks on the application layer (layer 7) by contracting [Web Application Firewall (WAF)](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/web-application-firewall/) module of [Azion Edge Firewall](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/).

## DDoS Protection - 20Gbps, 50Gbps, and Unlimited

For a higher level of protection, in addition to all the features of the standard modality, **DDoS Protection - 20Gbps, 50Gbps, and Unlimited** have extra features for detection against more sophisticated and large-scale attacks and is integrated with **Azion Edge Firewall**. Additionally, through the Infrastructure Protection add-on, you can protect your entire infrastructure (ASN), and through the **DNS Protection** add-on, you can protect your DNS service.

**DDoS Protection Unlimited** allows 24×7 access to Azion's Security Response Team (SRT), upon contracting Mission Critical Support, and cost protection during attacks.

### Flexible and customizable protection

Azion will be able to apply customized rules to mitigate sophisticated attacks from the network, transport and application layers. These rules can be applied instantly, allowing you to quickly and efficiently protect your content or application.

With support from our SRT, you can proactively write attack mitigation rules, using Azion **WAF** and **Edge Firewall**, and apply them via **Real-Time Manager** or API whenever needed.

### Protection tailored to your needs

**DDoS Protection** can be contracted for plans with an attack volume of 20 Gbps, 50 Gbps or Unlimited, in addition to available add-ons.

| 20 Gbps                                                      | 50 Gbps                                                      | Unlimited                                                    |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Suitable for medium-sized companies, it offers protection against DDoS attacks of up to 20 Gbps. | Suitable for medium and large companies, it offers protection against DDoS attacks of up to 50 Gbps. | Indicated for companies that use Azion in mission critical systems, with a direct impact on the business results, and who want protection against any attack volume for their content and applications. |

### Advanced detection

Azion **DDoS Protection - 20Gbps, 50Gbps, and Unlimited** offers advanced detection, inspecting network flows, as well as monitoring each application layer for its resources delivered by Azion using Azion **WAF** and Azion **Edge Firewall**. It uses advanced algorithms and Software-Defined Network (SDN) to enable granular detection and mitigation of DDoS attacks. Azion **DDoS Protection - 20Gbps, 50Gbps, and Unlimited** detects attacks such as HTTP floods, HTTP Slow Reads, DNS query floods, SYN/ACK Flood and many others.

### Mitigation of complex attacks

In addition to the benefits of the standard modality, **Azion DDoS Protection - 20Gbps, 50Gbps**, and Unlimited offers more sophisticated algorithms for automated attack mitigation. Using advanced routing techniques, **DDoS Protection - 20Gbps, 50Gbps, and Unlimited** offers an additional level of automated protection against higher volume DDoS attacks.

For application layer attacks, you will need Azion **WAF** to create advanced rules to automatically block malicious requests and Azion **Edge Firewall** to configure proactive blacklist or whitelist rules for networks, geolocation or rate limit, or create standby rules to be used in response to incidents as they happen.

### Protection of your infrastructure

The Infrastructure Protection add-on allows you to protect your own infrastructure (Autonomous System Number [ASN]) from DDoS attacks. The mitigation of DDoS attacks against your infrastructure is performed using Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and can be activated during an attack or it can be activated during an attack or remain always-on. To ensure security against application layer attacks, in addition to Azion **WAF** we also suggest using Azion **Origin Shield** to ensure that accesses to your infrastructure are always done through Azion.

### Protection for your DNS

The **DNS Protection** add-on allows you to protect your DNS service from DDoS attacks. By keeping your DNS Master server hidden and spreading Azion's DNS servers to the internet, you will rely on Azion to ensure the continuity of your services. The Azion DNS service is distributed in different geographic regions and has protection against DDoS attacks. Azion's DNS servers get their configuration from the customer's Master server, whether it is inside their infrastructure or in the cloud. If your infrastructure already uses the [DNSSEC extension](/en/documentation/products/intelligent-dns/dnssec-compatibility), you can count on **DDoS Protection** without giving up the guarantee of integrity and authenticity of your records, thus providing security and availability for address resolution for your business.

### Attack visibility

Azion **DDoS Protection - 20Gbps, 50Gbps, and Unlimited** offers complete visibility of application attacks through the **Real-Time Manager** or API to be able to view the volume of attacks. In conjunction with our SRT, you will have access to post-event analysis and investigations.

### Security Response Team (SRT)

If you choose the Mission Critical support plan along with **DDoS Protection Unlimited**, you will have 24×7 access to Azion's Security Response Team (SRT), which can be triggered during or after an attack or even earlier for support in building proactive rules.

Whenever triggered, the SRT will assist you in tracing incidents, identifying the main cause and applying the necessary mitigations on your behalf.

### Cost protection

**DDoS Protection - 20Gbps, 50Gbps, and Unlimited** include Cost Protection for your Azion services, a measure to guarantee against the increase in your Azion costs resulting from a volumetric attack.

If the use of any of your Azion services expands in response to a DDoS attack, Azion will provide service credits to avoid surplus charges for peak usage.
