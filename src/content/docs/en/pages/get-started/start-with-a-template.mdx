Building an edge application is the first step to start using **Azion Edge Platform**. This documentation presents the step by step to build and deploy a new application, using an Azion template.

Templates are pre-designed and reusable configurations that help to streamline the process of creating applications. In this matter, Azion offers a variety of templates to serve different use cases.

</Button>

You have these ways to start building with a template:

- Via [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](#via-real-time-manager-rtm), Azion's configuration interface.
- Via [Azion CLI](#via-azion-cli).

## Via Real-Time Manager (RTM)

### Setting up the template

:::note
Some templates are integrated with third-party services. In order to work appropiately, you need to comply certain requirements, such a creating an account, generating tokens, or setting up configurations on the third-party platform. You can go to the [guides page](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/#templates) and check more details on the specific template you're willing to use.
:::

To build an edge application using a template, proceed as follows:

1. [Access RTM](https://manager.azion.com/).
  - If you don’t have an account yet, create a new one by visiting the [sign-up page](https://manager.azion.com/signup).
2. On the homepage, select the **Start with a template** option.
3. Find the card of the template you want to start with and select it.
4. Click the **Settings** tab to open the configuration section.
5. In the configuration form, fill in the presented fields to set up your application.
  - Fields identified with an asterisk are mandatory.
6. Click the **Next** button, located in the bottom-right corner to start the deployment process.

### Deploying the template

During the deployment, you’ll be able to follow the process through a window showing off the logs. When it’s complete, the *deployment* page appears, confirming the edge application has been successfully created.

This page shows you the following sections:

- **Access your Edge Application** section includes the link to visit and explore your edge application.
- **Build Summary** contains the application’s name and function.
- The **Deployment details** tab can be opened to access the logs related to the deployment.
- **What do you want to do next?** provides recommendations regarding advanced options to enhance your edge application: **Customize Domain**, **Manage Edge Application**, **View Edge Application Metrics**, **View Edge Application Logs**, and the **Back to Home** button.

:::note
The link to the edge application allows you to see it on the browser. However, ​​it takes a certain time to propagate and configure the application in Azion’s edge locations. It may be necessary to wait a few minutes for the URL to be activated and for the application page to be effectively displayed in the browser.
:::

#### Key configurations

After the deployment, each template creates a new edge application and its Azion domain; in some cases, it could create a new edge function as well. Each template also establishes some pre-defined key configurations to optimize your application's performance.

Additionally, to guarantee the optimal performance of certain templates, it could be necessary to activate some Azion products.

Go to the [guides page](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/#templates) and check more details on the specific template you're willing to use.

### Managing the template

Considering that this initial setup may not be optimal for your specific edge application, all settings can be customized any time you need by using Azion Real-Time Manager (RTM).

You can also [configure a custom domain](/en/documentation/products/guides/configure-a-domain/) for users to access your edge application through it.

To know more on how to edit and customize your application’s main settings, go to the [Configuring main settings](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/configure-main-settings/) guide.

## Via Azion CLI

### Requirements

Before getting started, you must have:

- An [Azion account](/en/documentation/products/accounts/creating-account/) with [Edge Functions](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-functions/) enabled.
- [The latest version of Azion CLI installed](/en/documentation/products/cli/overview/).
- Code editor.
- Access to the terminal.

### Initializing a project on the edge

1. Initialize the project:

```sh 
  azion init
```

2. Accept the suggested name for your project, or enter a name:

```sh 
(Hit enter to accept the suggested name in parentheses) Your project's name:  (dynamic_caligari)
```

Output:

```sh
Getting modes available
```

3. Choose the template for your project:

```sh 
Getting modes available? Choose a template for your project: (Use arrow keys)
 ❯Angular 
  Astro 
  Hexo 
  Next 
  React 
  Vue 
  Vite 
```

Now, the CLI will follow the process and initialize your project.

4. After the initialization is complete, choose the mode:

```sh 
Choose a mode:  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
  ❯Javascript (Compute)
  Typescript (Compute)
  Angular (Deliver)
  Astro (Deliver)
  Hexo (Deliver)
  Next (Deliver)
  React (Deliver)
```

5. With the template fetched and configured, you can now start a local development server.

```sh 
Do you want to start a local development server? (y/N) 
```

The following steps are based on the answer you gave. 

- [If you chose to have a local development server running](#answering-yes-to-local-dev).
- [If you chose not to have a local development server running](#answering-no-to-local-dev).

#### Answering yes to local dev

1. Install the project dependencies. Input `y` when the interaction prompts:

```sh 
  Do you want to install project dependencies? This may be required to start local development server (y/N)
```

Wait until the installation is complete.

Output:

```sh
Your Edge Application was built successfully
[Vulcan] [Server] › ✔  success   Function running on port http://localhost:3000/
```

2. On the browser, go to `http://localhost:3000/` and you can see your project running.

#### Deploying the project

When your project is running locally, you're still able to deploy it to the edge. To do so: 

1. Stop the terminal execution with `control + c`. 
2. Access the project folder:

```sh
cd [your-project-name] 
```

3. Deploy the project: 

```sh
azion deploy
```

4. Wait while the project is built and deployed to the Azion Edge Platform.

:::note
After the deployment is complete, you'll receive a domain to access your project on the Azion's platform.
Wait a few minutes so the propagation takes place, and then access your application using the provided domain, which should be similar to `https://xxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`.
:::

#### Answering no to local dev

After indicating you don't want to have a local server running, deploy the project to the edge. 

1. Enter `y` to the following interaction, indicating you want to deploy the project:

```sh
   Do you want to deploy your project? (y/N) 
```

2. Install the project dependencies. Input `y` when the interaction prompts:

```sh 
  Do you want to install project dependencies? This may be required to deploy your project (y/N)
```

3. Wait while the project is built and deployed to the Azion Edge Platform.

:::note
After the deployment is complete, you'll receive a domain to access your project on the Azion's platform.
Wait a few minutes so the propagation takes place, and then access your application using the provided domain, which should be similar to `https://xxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`.
:::

## Next steps

Done, you've built an edge application! Now you can explore more Azion modules and configure advanced settings for it.

To do so, continue the **Get started** documentation by clicking the **Next Page** button, located at the bottom-right corner of this page, to go to the next step.
