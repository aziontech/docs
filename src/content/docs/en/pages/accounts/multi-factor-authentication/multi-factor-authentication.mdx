**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** is an electronic verification method used to secure logins. With MFA, the user must provide at least two pieces of identity evidence to be able to login into their account. In this case, it's a combination of a password and a third-party authenticator application on a mobile device.

Advantages of setting MFA in your account:
- Enhance security, making unauthorized access more difficult for malicious actors.
- Reduce vulnerabilities, when requiring MFA the likelihood of successful phishing attempts or password breaches decreases.
- Secure remote access, ensuring secure logins even from external locations.

Before you enable this setting on **Real-Time Manager (RTM)**, make sure your mobile device supports an MFA application, such as Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator, available in the iOS App Store, Google Play, and other mobile app stores.

> MFA activation is optional but highly recommended for added account security. Users are encouraged to enable MFA, particularly those with elevated access privileges.

## Error treatment

Incorrect Pairing: errors may occur if the authenticator app isn't correctly paired with the RTM account.

Time Synchronization: inaccurate time settings on the mobile device and the authenticator app can lead to authentication failures.

Lost mobile device: without backup access methods, a lost or damaged mobile device could result in account lockout. In this case, you need to ask the *Account Owner* to restore your MFA.
