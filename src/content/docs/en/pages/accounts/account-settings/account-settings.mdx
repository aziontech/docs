## Authentication Settings

### Social Login

If you're the *Account Owner*, you can enable and disable the **Social Login** functionality using its switch. When it's enabled, users linked to the account can authenticate to [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/) using the supported social networks. Otherwise, they have to log in using their email and password. Learn more about it on the [Social Login](/en/documentation/products/accounts/social-login/) page.

   > When you enable **Social Login**, it applies to all users of the account.

Once Social Login is enabled, users can [access RTM](https://manager.azion.com/) via Social Login on their next login.

   > Currently, Azion supports Social Login with GitHub and Google accounts.


### Multi-Factor Authentication

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** provides an extra level of security to protect your users' credentials. Only the *Account Owner* can enable these settings. 

   > When MFA is enabled, it'll be mandatory for all users of the account, except the **Account owner**.
   
Learn how to set up an MFA mobile application on the [Multi-Factor Authentication](/en/documentation/products/accounts/multi-factor-authentication/) page.

[Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/) allows you to delete your account. 

Only the *Account Owner* can delete the account. If you have *Account Owner* privileges, you'll see the **Delete account** button at the bottom of the page.

After successfully deleting your account, you'll receive an email confirming the deletion of your account. If you want to give feedback on your experience with Azion, contact the team through [this email](mailto:feedback@azion.com).
