On the **Team Permissions** page in Real-Time Manager (RTM) you can create and manage teams, control and configure access rights for distinct teams within your organization. You can, for example, create groups dividing them into the tasks that they need to perform at RTM.

Only users with **Account Owner** status can add teams and edit permissions. 

By granting or restricting access to specific features and settings, you can:

- Save time, since the teams access only what they need.
- Enhance security, limiting the access to keep sensitive information safe.
- Have more control, tracking the specific teams actions for security and rules.
- Encourage teamwork with the team accessing tools together.
