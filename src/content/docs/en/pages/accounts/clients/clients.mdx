**Real-Time Manager** allows you to create separate accounts, called **Clients**, for each of the affiliates in the **Groups** accounts of your company.

You can manage the group's accounts independently, with different Account owners, to streamline your day-to-day processes even further.

You need to be an **Account owner** or have the **View client list** and **Change clients** permissions to add clients to your account.

> The Clients feature is only available for accounts of the Group type.
