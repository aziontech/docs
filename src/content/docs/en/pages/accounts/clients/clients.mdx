**Real-Time Manager** allows you to create separate accounts, called **Clients**, for each of the affiliates in the Groups accounts of your company.

Thus, you can manage the group's accounts independently, with different Account owners, to streamline your day-to-day processes even further. You need to be **Account Owner** or have the **View client list** and **Change clients** permissions to add clients to your account.

> The Clients feature is only available for accounts of the Group type.

**Account name**: name of the affiliated company; it is the _Client_ type account.

**Company name**: corporate name.

**Unique identifier:** unique code that identifies the legal entity of that affiliate.

**Billing emails:** billing email addresses.

**Active Client:** this button enables/disables the operation of that client.

### Address Information

**Country**: country where the affiliate is located.

**State/Region**: state / region where the affiliate is located.

**City:** city where the affiliate is located.

**Postal code:** postal code of the affiliate.

### Account Owner

These fields refer to the *Client Owner*.
