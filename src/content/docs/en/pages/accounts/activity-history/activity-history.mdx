On [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/), you can access the **Activity History** associated with your account. This feature provides insights into the actions carried out within your account by all connected users.

Once you open the page, you'll see the history from the most recent to the oldest activity of the account. In the *search field*, you can filter the results by activity performed or by a user, for example.

The **Activity History** helps you:

- Obtain a clear view of when specific actions were done and identify the users responsible for them.
- Enhance user accountability by maintaining a transparent record of account activities.
- Address any anomalies or discrepancies by tracing recent account actions.
- Make decisions based on a clear understanding of recent account interactions.
