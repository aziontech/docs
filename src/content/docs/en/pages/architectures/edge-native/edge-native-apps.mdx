Edge native computing is a processing methodology where data is stored and processed at your network's edge, where data originates. This approach increases application performance by reducing latency, enhancing security, and improving scalability.

Azion services and products can help build a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API-based application with frontend, running entirely on the edge native computing environment. This approach provides superior performance, scalability, and dependable data transactions.

## Edge Native Applications Architecture with CRUD API

### Dataflow

1. The user navigates to the domain, representing a service hosted on Azion's edge native computing platform.

    1.1. The request is routed directly within the Azion ecosystem, without any need for external cloud-based applications.

    1.2. The system directs the request to the application situated at the network's edge.

2. An edge application rule activates an edge function. Developed in JavaScript and deployed onto the Azion Edge Platform, this function governs the logic behind the CRUD operations of the application's frontend.

3. The Edge function handles CRUD operations like getting a list of products, viewing a specific product detail, adding a new product, updating an existing product, or deleting an existing product â€” accomplished using Edge SQL. These database operations would be performed closer to the user, significantly reducing latency.

4. If static content is present (such as product images, interface components), it will be stored in Edge Storage, enabling faster retrieval and reducing the load on central servers.

The edge application then returns a response to the request, with the result of the CRUD operation.

## Components
- [Edge Application](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/): Configure delivery and cache policies, create rules to automate cache policy assignment based on content type, and determine how content is cached.
    - [Edge Functions](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-functions/): Develop event-driven, serverless applications at the network's edge to handle your app's logic, including CRUD operations.
    - [Edge Storage](/en/documentation/products/store/edge-storage/): A scalable and secure storage service for storing static content of your application, including images and frontend assets.
    - [Edge SQL](/en/documentation/products/store/edge-sql/): A serverless SQL solution natively built for the edge, capable of handling database operations of your CRUD application at a much lower latency.

## Implementation
1. Create an edge application: Use the **+ Create** button on the [Console](https://console.azion.com) homepage, or leverage the [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/#d43c5509-fb99-4b20-a7bd-64f0924af352), or use the [Azion CLI](/en/documentation/devtools/cli/create/#edge-applications).
2. Implement and deploy an edge function within the recently created application to handle the logic of your CRUD operations.
3. Create a domain and link it to the edge application: Use the Console or the Azion API. If you used a template for application creation, the domain is automatically created for you.

    :::note 
    The edge application can be accessed through the Azion provided domain, which is similar to: `ftd1cvntfl.map.azionedge.net`.
    :::

4. Test and monitor your edge application to ensure that all operations perform as intended.
