### Application Delivery and Operations Dataflow

1. The user accesses the **Azion Console** to manage the **Edge Nodes**.
2. The user binds an **Edge Service** to the **Edge Nodes**.
3. The **Edge Nodes** are managed and configured through the **Edge Service Binding**.
4. The **Orchestrator** orchestrates services on the **Edge Nodes**.
5. The **Edge Nodes** now contains an HTML page containing a list of products.

HTML with the products list: 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

## Components

- [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/): interface for managing and monitoring applications and services.
- [Azion Orchestrator](/en/documentation/products/deploy/orchestrator/): automates deployment and management of applications across edge nodes.
- [Edge Nodes](/en/documentation/products/deploy/orchestrator/edge-node/): distributed computing resources that process data closer to the source.
- [Edge Services](/en/documentation/products/deploy/orchestrator/edge-services/): enables services creation and customization for orchestration on Edge Nodes.

---

## Implementation

1. [Install Orchestrator Agent](/en/documentation/products/guides/deploy/install-orchestrator-agent/) in your device to turn it into an edge node.
2. Authorize the edge node so it can be orchestrated.
    - On Console, you can see and [authorize edge nodes](/en/documentation/products/guides/deploy/authorize-an-edge-node/).
    - Use [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/#e6a19e66-71e9-4b10-b50c-c0e0684bf458) to authorize a node.
3. [Create services](/en/documentation/products/guides/deploy/create-edge-service/) that will save an HTML page on the nodes.
4. Bind services to edge nodes.
    - On Console, [bind services](/en/documentation/products/guides/deploy/bind-service-node/) to your edge nodes.
    - Use [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/#230b2947-a706-4143-ae96-3115b8ecd333) to bind a service to an edge node.
5. [Watch logs](/en/documentation/products/guides/deploy/watch-logs/) from your edges nodes and services.
