[Azion Edge Orchestrator](/en/documentation/products/deploy/edge-orchestrator/) allows you to automate and manage your infrastructure efficiently. By leveraging [Azion CLI](/en/documentation/products/azion-cli/overview/), you can perform tasks such as deployment, monitoring, and updates of edge applications. This guide provides an in-depth look at the architecture and steps for implementing infrastructure automation using Azion Edge Orchestrator, helping you achieve optimal performance and streamlined operations.

## Architecture

:::note
This flow assumes that a service has been created for installing Azion CLI on the edge node. For further information on the implementation, check the Implementation section.

### Dataflow

1. The user accesses the **Azion Console** to manage the **Edge Nodes**.
2. The user binds an **Edge Service** to the **Edge Nodes**.
3. The **Edge Nodes** are managed and configured through the **Edge Service Binding**.
4. The **Orchestrator** orchestrates services on the **Edge Nodes**.

## Components

- [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/): interface for managing and monitoring edge applications and services.
- [Azion Edge Orchestrator](/en/documentation/products/deploy/edge-orchestrator/): automates deployment and management of applications across edge nodes.
- [Azion CLI](/en/documentation/products/guides/deploy/install-orchestrator-agent/): command-line tool for automating tasks like deployment of applications and monitoring.
- [Edge Nodes](/en/documentation/products/deploy/edge-orchestrator/edge-node/): distributed computing resources that process data closer to the source.
