[Azion Orchestrator](/en/documentation/products/deploy/orchestrator/) allows you to automate and manage your infrastructure efficiently. By leveraging [Azion CLI](/en/documentation/products/azion-cli/overview/), you can perform tasks such as deployment, monitoring, and updates of applications. This documentation provides an in-depth look at the architecture and steps for implementing infrastructure automation using Azion Orchestrator, helping you achieve optimal performance and streamlined operations.

## Architecture

:::note
This flow assumes a service has been created for installing Azion CLI on the edge node. For further information, check the [Implementation](#implementation) section.

### Dataflow

1. The user accesses the **Azion Console** to manage the **Edge Nodes**.
2. The user binds an **Edge Service** to the **Edge Nodes**.
3. The **Edge Nodes** are managed and configured through the **Edge Service Binding**.
4. The **Orchestrator** orchestrates services on the **Edge Nodes**.

---

## Components

- [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/): interface for managing and monitoring applications and services.
- [Azion Orchestrator](/en/documentation/products/deploy/orchestrator/): automates deployment and management of applications across edge nodes.
- [Edge Nodes](/en/documentation/products/deploy/orchestrator/edge-node/): distributed computing resources that process data closer to the source.
- [Edge Services](/en/documentation/products/deploy/orchestrator/edge-services/): enables services creation and customization for orchestration on Edge Nodes.

---

## Implementation

1. [Install Orchestrator Agent](/en/documentation/products/guides/deploy/install-orchestrator-agent/) in your device to turn it into an edge node.
2. Authorize the edge node so it can be orchestrated.
    - On Console, you can see and [authorize edge nodes](/en/documentation/products/guides/deploy/authorize-an-edge-node/).
    - Use [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/#e6a19e66-71e9-4b10-b50c-c0e0684bf458) to authorize a node.
3. Create services that will [run scripts](/en/documentation/products/guides/deploy/advanced/run-scripts/) on the nodes.
4. Bind services to edge nodes.
    - On Console, [bind services](/en/documentation/products/guides/deploy/bind-service-node/) to your edge nodes.
    - Use [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/#230b2947-a706-4143-ae96-3115b8ecd333) to bind a service to an edge node.
5. [Watch logs](/en/documentation/products/guides/deploy/watch-logs/) from your edges nodes and services.
