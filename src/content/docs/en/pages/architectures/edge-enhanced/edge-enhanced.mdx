Edge computing is a technology that brings data storage and processing closer to the source of data - the edge of your network. The use of edge computing introduces several advantages, mainly reduced latency, increased security, and improved scalability. 

Using Azion services and products, we demonstrate how an ecommerce application's shopping cart feature can be moved to an edge computing environment. The proposed serverless approach integrated with other edge capabilities offers high performance, scalability, and reliable data transaction.

## Cart Management at the Edge

By hosting applications and services on the edge, we can streamline data flow, enhance user experiences and facilitate ecommerce operations. We focus on the shopping cart functionality for this illustration, as this service is critical for ecommerce platforms and can significantly benefit from edge applications.

### Dataflow

---
## Components

- Edge Application encompasses delivery and cache policies, rules for cache policy assignments based on cart updates, and determines how cart interactions are cached.
    - Edge Cache configures scenarios with specific cache policies, ensuring control over cart content delivery.
    - Rules Engine sets up scenarios where certain policies are enforced, offering granular control over cart interactions.
    - Application Accelerator configures the Advanced Cache Key feature to generate protocol optimizations and different cache object identification for cart contents.
- Domains are utilized to document a custom domain with Azion, enabling cart management at the edge.
