Azion [bots management solution](https://www.azion.com/en/solutions/bot-management/) utilizes machine learning to analyze request behaviors and intentions, distinguishing between humans and various bot categories. Upon analysis, each request is scored and classified, allowing for the execution of predefined preventive actions based on customer-set thresholds. This dynamic approach is enhanced by continuous data analysis, enabling the refinement of detection rules for improved efficiency and security. This solution ensures seamless user experiences while effectively countering malicious bot activity.

This solution is ideal for organizations looking to mitigate security risks, prevent fraud, ensure fair access to legitimate users, improve the overall user experience, and enhance website performance by reducing unnecessary and malicious traffic.

### Bot Management Dataflow

1. A request reaches Azion Web Platform.
2. Edge Firewall processes the request and executes the Bot Manager. It starts all the analytics processes:
    - Retrieving the requested data, including device, browser, and network data, among others.
    - Identifying and classifying the request according to the intent-based behavioral analysis.
3. Bot Manager assigns a score and classifies the request.
4. According to the request intent classification, the predefined preventive action is executed, including allow, deny, drop, redirect, custom_html, random_delay, and hold_connection.
5. Data reaches the application, where Rules Engine decides: generate content immediately or route flow to Origin Application for a response.
6. Activity can be observed through Real-Time Events or by using a Data Stream connector to feed event logs into your stream processing, SIEM, and big data platforms.

### Components

- [Edge Firewall](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-firewall/) executes the Bot Manager add-on and other security rules.
- [Bot Manager](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-firewall/bot-manager/) is an Edge Firewall add-on for bot management.
  - This add-on is Azion's comprehensive solution for bot management. A [lite version integration](/en/documentation/products/guides/bot-manager-lite/) is also available in the Marketplace.
- [Applications](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/) is your application running on top of the Azion Web Platform.
- [Data Stream](/en/documentation/products/observe/data-stream/) and [Real-Time Events](/en/documentation/products/observe/real-time-metrics/) enable you to monitor all Bot Manager activity.

## Implementation

You can test and implement Azion Bot Manager in two ways:

- Using [Azion Templates](/en/documentation/products/marketplace/templates/) based on the Bot Manager Lite version: pre-built and pre-configured projects designed to accelerate the implementation of bot management.
    - [Bot Manager Lite Starter Kit](/en/documentation/products/guides/bot-manager-lite-starter-kit/): with this template, you're able to deploy a new edge stack and see the Bot Manager Lite in action. To easily deploy this template at the edge, click the button below:

      <LinkButton
        label="Deploy Bot Manager Lite Starter Kit"
        link="https://console.azion.com/create/azion/bot-manager-lite-starter-kit"
        icon="ai ai-azion"
        icon-pos="left"
        target="_blank"
      />

    - [Bot Manager Lite Integration Kit](/en/documentation/products/guides/bot-manager-lite-integration-kit/): an easy way to integrate the Bot Manager Lite function in an existent edge firewall on Azion. To easily deploy this template at the edge, click the button below:
    
      <LinkButton
        label="Deploy Bot Manager Lite Integration Kit"
        link="https://console.azion.com/create/azion/bot-manager-lite-integration-kit"
        icon="ai ai-azion"
        icon-pos="left"
        target="_blank"
      />

    - [Bot Manager Lite and TOR Block Starter Kit](/en/documentation/products/guides/bot-manager-lite-and-tor-block-starter-kit/): deploy a basic security suite to protect your domains from bad bots and TOR Exit Nodes requests. To easily deploy this template at the edge, click the button below:

      <LinkButton
        label="Deploy Bot Manager Lite and TOR Block Starter Kit"
        link="https://console.azion.com/create/azion/bot-manager-lite-and-tor-block-starter-kit"
        icon="ai ai-azion"
        icon-pos="left"
        target="_blank"
      />

- From scratch: create an entire edge stack from zero, including Bot Manager. To do so: 
    1. [Create an application](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/build-an-application/).
    2. [Add a custom domain to it](/en/documentation/products/guides/configure-a-domain/).
    3. [Enable Bot Manager](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-firewall/bot-manager/).
        - Contact the [Sales team](https://www.azion.com/en/contact-sales/) for more details on the Bot Manager subscription.
        - [Configure Bot Manager Lite](/en/documentation/products/guides/bot-manager-lite/) if you've decided to use this version.
    4. [Monitor bot activity](/en/documentation/products/observe/data-stream/first-steps/) and calibrate rules.
