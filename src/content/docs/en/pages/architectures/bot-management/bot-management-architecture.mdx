Azion [bots management solution](https://www.azion.com/en/solutions/bot-management/) utilizes machine learning to analyze request behaviors and intentions, distinguishing between humans and various bot categories. Upon analysis, each request is scored and classified, allowing for the execution of predefined preventive actions based on customer-set thresholds. This dynamic approach is enhanced by continuous data analysis, enabling the refinement of detection rules for improved efficiency and security. This solution ensures seamless user experiences while effectively countering malicious bot activity.

This solution is ideal for organizations looking to mitigate security risks, prevent fraud, ensure fair access to legitimate users, improve the overall user experience, and enhance website performance by reducing unnecessary and malicious traffic.

### Bot Management Dataflow

1. A request reaches Azion Edge Platform.
2. Edge Firewall processes the request and executes the Bot Manager. It starts all the analytics processes:
    - Retrieving the requested data, including device, browser, and network data, among others.
    - Identifying and classifying the request according to the intent-based behavioral analysis.
3. Bot Manager assigns a score and classifies the request.
4. According to the request intent classification, the predefined preventive action is executed, including allow, deny, drop, redirect, custom_html, random_delay, and hold_connection.
5. Data reaches the edge application, where Rules Engine decides: generate content immediately or route flow to Origin Application for a response.
6. Activity can be observed through Real-Time Events or by using a Data Stream connector to feed event logs into your stream processing, SIEM, and big data platforms.

### Components

- [Edge Firewall](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-firewall/) executes the Bot Manager add-on and other security rules.
- [Bot Manager](/en/documentation/products/guides/bot-manager/) is an Edge Firewall add-on available at Azion Marketplace.
- [Edge Application](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/) is your application running on top of the Azion Edge Platform.
- [Data Stream](/en/documentation/products/observe/data-stream/) and [Real-Time Events](/en/documentation/products/observe/real-time-metrics/) enable you to monitor all Bot Manager activity.

## Implementation

You can test and implement Azion Bot Manager in two ways:

- Using [Azion Templates](/en/documentation/products/marketplace/templates/): pre-built and pre-configured projects designed to accelerate the implementation of bot management:
    - [Bot Manager Starter Kit](/en/documentation/products/guides/bot-manager-starter-kit/): with this template, you're able to deploy a new edge stack and see the Bot Manager in action.
    - [Bot Manager Integration Kit](/en/documentation/products/guides/bot-manager-integration-kit/): an easy way to integrate the Bot Manager function in an existent edge firewall on Azion.
    - [Bot Manager and TOR Block Starter Kit](/en/documentation/products/guides/bot-manager-and-tor-block-starter-kit/): deploy a basic security suite to protect your domains from bad bots and TOR Exit Nodes requests.

- From scratch: create an entire edge stack from zero, including Bot Manager integration. To do so: 
    1. [Create an edge application](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/build-an-application/).
    2. [Add a custom domain to it](/en/documentation/products/guides/configure-a-domain/).
    3. [Install Bot Manager](/en/documentation/products/guides/bot-manager/).
    4. [Configure Bot Manager](/en/documentation/products/guides/bot-manager/#configuring-the-integration).
        - While setting up the function instance, you'll define the parameters for it.
    5. [Monitor bot activity](/en/documentation/products/observe/data-stream/first-steps/) and calibrate rules.
