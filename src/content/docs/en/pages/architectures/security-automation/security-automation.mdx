As cyber threats grow more sophisticated, security automation has become essential for organizations to streamline repetitive and time-consuming tasks, manage their security posture, and scale their operations effectively.

In this context, autonomous systems operate with minimal or no human intervention, using artificial intelligence and security automation to detect, prevent, and respond to threats. Implementing these systems offers the following benefits:

- Real-time threat detection through advanced AI algorithms.
- Continuous self-improvement and learning by AI and automated systems.
- Improved scalability to efficiently handle large volumes of data and events.
- Automated responses based on predefined behaviors and rules to mitigate threats.
- Predictive analytics to anticipate and address potential security risks.
- Enhanced operational efficiency with minimal intervention, reducing human error.
- Protection against increasingly sophisticated threats like phishing, malware, prompt injection, adversarial manipulation, and data leaks in modern applications.
