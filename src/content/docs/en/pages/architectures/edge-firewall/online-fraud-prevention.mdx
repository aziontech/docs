As sensitive data flows across networks, online fraud prevention has become a cornerstone of any digital business's success, especially e-commerce and financial services. Cyber threats continue to evolve, increasing both the volume and sophistication of attacks. These include account takeover attempts and automated and manual fraud schemes, such as credential stuffing, phishing attacks, card testing, synthetic identity fraud, and payment fraud.

To stay ahead, these businesses must adopt a proactive, multi-layered security strategy to protect their services, minimize friction, and build lasting user trust. A comprehensive security strategy includes a trusted technology partner that provides an integrated edge platform with the products and services you need to do so.

This includes network protection with zero-trust architecture, firewalls, bot management, and device detection for secure authentication. A Web Application Firewall (WAF) safeguards applications, while encryption and access controls protect sensitive data. Flexible integrations ensure that security measures adapt to your business needs.

This approach performs fraud detection directly at the edge before reaching your applications and origins. Additionally, continuous observability ensures that potential threats are identified and mitigated early, reducing the impact on your brand reputation and user experience and minimizing friction across all touchpoints.

### Online Fraud Prevention Dataflow

1. A request reaches **Azion Edge Platform**.
- The platform has its own security mechanisms, including real-time monitoring and threat detection, encryption, access controls, protocols, and distributed firewalls. It also adheres to compliance requirements (PCI, SOC, LGPD/GPDR) and has a [Security Response Team (SRT)](/en/documentation/services/security-response-team/) that is constantly monitoring it. 
2. The platform sends the request to the healthiest edge node.
3. After reaching the node, the request is analyzed by **Edge Firewall**:
- **DDoS Protection** checks for potential DDoS or DoS attacks, blocking or allowing the request accordingly. It's automatically enabled in all accounts.
- **Bot Manager** assigns a score and classifies the request; then, executes the predefined preventive action: `allow`, `deny`, `drop`, `redirect`, `custom_html`, `random_delay`, and `hold_connection`.
- **WAF Rules** are applied and executed.
- The **Rules Engine** executes security rules based on the criteria and behaviors configured.
- **Azion Marketplace Integrations** for security are executed to complete the analysis and verification.
  - Identity providers (IdPs).
  - Fraud detection services.
  - Biometric verification.
  - Reputation analysis.
4. Based on the firewall, account management, and integrations' configurations, the system denies any unauthorized request. Otherwise, the request continues the flow to **Edge Application**.
5. **Edge Application** executes all the configurations, according to the request:
- Optimized caching rules and advanced cache key settings to improve content delivery and efficiency.
- Device groups with targeted configurations based on device types for better control and security.  
- Intelligent traffic distribution to improve availability, reliability, and performance through load balancing.
- Requests, response, and other **Rules Engine** rules.
6. **Edge Application** resolves the request and sends an adequate response.
7. The request only reaches the origin if the edge node doesn't contain the necessary response, after passing through all the implemented security policies.
8. Customers can use observability tools to monitor and act proactively against any threat:
- **Real-Time Events** enables access to detailed logs for real-time insights and auditing.
- **Real-Time Metrics** offers real-time visibility into performance and security trends through detailed graphics.
- **Data Stream** helps you send data to SIEM or Big Data tools for advanced analysis and threat detection.
9. Customers also can seamlessly implement custom integrations with Azion to reinforce security, such as IdP, SSO, SIEM and Big Data platforms, and more.
