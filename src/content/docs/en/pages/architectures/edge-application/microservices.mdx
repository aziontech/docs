Adopting a serverless microservices architecture with Azion Edge Functions brings several significant benefits in this context. Firstly, it improves scalability by allowing each service to scale independently based on its own demand, rather than scaling the entire application based on the demand of a single service. This leads to more efficient resource utilization and cost savings.

Additionally, it enhances flexibility by allowing each service to be developed, deployed, and updated independently. This means that changes can be made to one service without impacting the others, enabling faster innovation and reducing the risk of system-wide failures.

## Architecture

### Dataflow

1. A user sends a request to the **Domain** associated with an edge application. This request is directed to the **Azion Traffic Router**, which identifies the appropriate **Edge Node** to process the request. 

2. The **Edge Firewall** then checks the request. If considered non-malicious, the request proceeds further to the edge application. 

3. At this stage, based on microservice architecture, the request branches out to different services in response to the **Rules Engine** configuration. This branching out means the services can evolve independently, facilitating faster innovation cycles and quick deployment of new features.

4. Various modules such as the **Image Processor**, **Edge Cache**, **Application Acceleration**, and **Edge Functions** are invoked based on their configuration. Each service in a microservices architecture corresponds to different business capabilities and is developed, deployed, and scaled independently, providing agility and resilience.

5. Static content gets saved in **Edge Storage** from where it's fetched and served as a response. This leverages edge computing to ensure lower latency and faster content delivery.

6. **Edge SQL** handles operations involving database transactions. This further emphasizes the separation of concerns, with every service taking ownership of its specific database to ensure loose coupling and high cohesion.

After these distinct yet cohesive processes, the content —processed and assembled— is delivered back to the client. This microservices-oriented data flow with edge computing ensures highly efficient, scalable, and resilient operations, offering considerable business advantages.

## Components

- **Edge Application**: module to configure delivery, cache policies, and automate cache policy assignments based on content type.
- **Edge Cache**: a global module facilitating caching content at the edge.
- **Edge Functions**: a mechanism to create event-driven, serverless microservices at the network's edge.
- **Rules Engine**: a tool to set conditions for cache policy enforcement.
- **Tiered Cache**: an extra cache layer between the edge and your origin servers to mitigate latency and infrastructure expenses.  
- **Load Balancer**: designed to manage traffic across your origins, data centers, or cloud providers, thereby reducing network congestion and server overload.
- **Edge Storage**: integrates object storage with the Azion Edge Platform using the S3 standard.
- **Origins**: customize your Edge Application content's source address, header, path, and HMAC authentication credentials.
- **Domains**: link your custom domain with Azion to provide the edge application.

## Implementation

1. Set up an edge application:
    - Utilize [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com) or [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/#9c61e0fd-e7aa-4a5f-b29e-7f9d71b98d5f) to create an edge application.
    - The [Azion CLI](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/cli/) is yet another powerful tool for creation and deployment.
    - The [Dynamic and Static File Optimization template](/en/documentation/products/guides/dynamic-and-static-file-optimization-template/) can help you to easily deploy an application.
2. Register a domain and link it with the edge application: 
    - [Create a domain](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/configure-a-domain/) on the Console, or use the [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/#a258eabc-b419-47e6-be68-45c2ce0150dd).
> The edge application, once set up, can be accessed via a domain provided by Azion, typically formed as: `ftd1cvntfl.map.azionedge.net`
3. Test and monitor the content delivery after configuration to ensure optimal functioning and then monitor incoming access.
4. Adjust caching policies, rules, or other configurations as per performance metrics and user feedback.
