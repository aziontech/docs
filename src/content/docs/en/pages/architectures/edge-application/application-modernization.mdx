At Azion, [application modernization](https://www.azion.com/en/solutions/application-modernization/) is a transformative process that upgrades legacy applications to align with the dynamic demands of modern business environments. It's implemented using a serverless approach and microservices architecture on an edge infrastructure, architecting your system for operational simplicity, faster deployment, and scalability. 

Azion optimizes performance by processing data closer to its source, drastically reducing latency and improving user experience. The serverless model cuts costs by eliminating server management and DevOps workflows, facilitating overall business efficiency, competitiveness, and new strategies adoption.

Your application can be completely hosted at Azion, but there's the possibility of having only parts of the system running at the edge. This possibility helps the migration of legacy applications to modern applications, as you can perform this piece by piece, adapting everything and testing to ensure it meets your needs.

## Architecture

![Overview of a request/response through Applications](/assets/docs/images/uploads/app-modernization.png?v=2)


### Dataflow

1. The user accesses the Domain related to the Application being accessed. This request goes to Azion Traffic Router, which chooses the optimal Edge Node to receive the request and directs the request to this Edge Node.

2. The request goes through Firewall and is analyzed. If it's not a malicious request, it reaches the Applications.

3. The request reaches the application and based on its Rules Engine configuration, accesses the requested content. If configured, Image Processor, Cache, Application Accelerator, and Functions will be executed. 

With Functions, you can have the logic performed at the edge, improving the usability and maintainability of decentralized applications. These functions are written in Javascript and run on Azion Runtime.

4. The content, if static, will be stored in Object Storage. So, it'll be requested and returned as a response.

5. Operations requiring database transactions can be accomplished with SQL Database.

6. The application's logs are sent through Data Stream and can be analyzed by the customer.

7. If it's necessary to access an origin outside Azion:
    - Activating Origin Shield, your application is protected from a network list maintained by Azion.
    - Activating the Load Balancer module balances traffic across your origins, data centers, or cloud providers and mitigates network congestion and server overload.

After all this process, the application returns a response to the request.

## Components
- [Applications](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/): set up an application to configure delivery and cache policies, create rules to automate cache policy assignments based on content type, and determine how content is cached.
    - [Cache](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/cache/): global module to cache content at the edge.
    - [Functions](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/functions/): allows you to create event-driven, serverless applications, at the edge of the network, closer to users.
    - [Rules Engine](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/rules-engine/): a tool to configure the scenarios in which a specific cache policy is enforced.
    - [Tiered Cache](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/cache/tiered-cache/): module that creates an additional cache layer between the edge and your origin servers, reducing latency and infrastructure costs. 
    - [Load Balancer](/en/documentation/products/secure/connectors/load-balancer/): module designed to balance traffic across your origins, data centers, or cloud providers, mitigating network congestion and server overload.
    - [Object Storage](/en/documentation/products/store/object-storage/): a scalable and secure storage service designed to integrate object storage with the Azion Web Platform using the S3 standard for object operations.
    - [Origins](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/origins/):  allows you to customize the source address of your Application content, the Host header of your application, the path, and the HMAC authentication credentials for protected services.
    - [Domains](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/domains/): register a custom domain with Azion to deliver the application.
- [Azion Marketplace](/en/documentation/products/marketplace/) is a digital catalog that makes it easy to find, test, and deploy edge-running software.
- [Azion CLI](/en/documentation/products/azion-cli/overview/):  an open-source command-line interface (CLI) that lets you interact with Azion Web Platform using a terminal. 
- [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/getting-to-know-azion-console/): Azion’s configuration interface where you can access all the available products and their settings. It enables you to complete all tasks in Azion’s platform

## Implementation

1. Create an application:
    - On [Console](https://console.azion.com), create an application using the **+ Create** button on the homepage.
    - Use the [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/#9c61e0fd-e7aa-4a5f-b29e-7f9d71b98d5f) to create an application.
    - Use the [Azion CLI](/en/documentation/devtools/cli/create/#edge-applications) to create and deploy an application.
2. Create a domain and associate it with the application: 
    - On Console, [create a domain](/en/documentation/products/guides/configure-a-domain/) using the + Create button on the homepage.
    - Use the [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/#a258eabc-b419-47e6-be68-45c2ce0150dd) to create a domain.
    - If you created an application through a template, the domain is created for you.
3. Point domain to Azion: [update your DNS settings](/en/documentation/products/guides/migrate-ns-to-azion/) to point your domain's CNAME record to the Azion CDN endpoint provided for your domain. This step isn't mandatory.

:::note 
The application is accessible through the domain provided by Azion, which looks similar to: `ftd1cvntfl.map.azionedge.net`. 
:::
4. Test and monitor your application.
