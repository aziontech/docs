Each [GraphQL API dataset](/en/documentation/products/graphql-api-features/#datasets) has specific fields that can be used when querying for data from that specific dataset. These fields are also used for the [Real-Time Metrics](/en/documentation/products/real-time-metrics/) interface on Real-Time Manager (RTM).

See each available field and their descriptions next.

:::note
The Real-Time Metrics interface on RTM also has the `domains` field for some dashboards, which exhibits all the domains configured in your account.
