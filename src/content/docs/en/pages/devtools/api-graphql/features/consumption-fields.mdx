### About countryCode and region fields

`countryCode` and `region` fields indicate the edge locations where data processing occurs, being determined by network architecture and routing. It's important to note that this location may not necessarily be the same as the location from which the user accesses the service or the origin of the data.

The `workloadConsumptionMetrics` uses the following regions and countries while retrieving results related to usage data:

| Region          | Country |
|---------------|-------------|
| All Other Regions | Angola, South Africa  |
