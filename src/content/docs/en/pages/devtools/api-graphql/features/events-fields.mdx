| requestMethod | HTTP request method. Example: `GET` or `POST` |
| requestTime | Request processing time, in seconds, since the first bytes were read from the client. This field is the result of a sum. Example: `0.234` |
| requestUri | URI of the request made by the end user, without the host and protocol information and with arguments. Example: `/v1?v=bo%20dim` |
| scheme | Request scheme. Example: `HTTP` or `HTTPS` |
| sentHttpContentType | `Content-Type` header sent in the origin’s response. Example: `text/html; charset=UTF-8` |
| serverProtocol | Request protocol. Example: `HTTP/1.1`, `HTTP/2.0`, `HTTP/3.0` |
| solution | Identifier of your application. Example: `1321` |
| status | HTTP status code of the request. Example: `200` |
| tcpinfoRtt | Round-Trip Time (RTT) measured by the edge for the user. Available on systems that support the TCP_INFO socket option. Example: `72052` |
| ts | Timestamp of when the event was created. Example: `2022-10-20T10:10:10` |
| upstreamBytesReceived | Number of bytes received by the origin’s edge if the content isn’t cached. Example: `8304` |
| upstreamBytesReceivedStr | List with all `upstreamBytesReceived` responses. |
| upstreamCacheStatus | Status of the local edge cache. Can be: `MISS`, `BYPASS`, `EXPIRED`, `STALE`, `UPDATING`, `REVALIDATED`, `HIT`, or `-` |
| upstreamConnectTime | Time it takes for the edge to establish a connection with the origin, in seconds. In the case of TLS, it includes time spent on handshake. Example: `0.123`. **Returns `0` for KeepAlive and `-` for cache** |
| upstreamHeaderTime | Time it takes for the edge to receive the response header from the origin, in seconds. Example: `0.345`. **In case of cache, the response is `-`** |
| upstreamResponseTime | Time it takes for the edge to receive a default response from the origin, in seconds, including headers and body. Example: `0.876`. **In case of cache, the response is `-`** |
| upstreamStatus | HTTP status code of the origin. If a server can't be selected, the variable keeps the 502 (Bad Gateway) status code. Example: `200`. **In case of cache, the response is `-`**. |
