The **GraphQL API** returns standard HTTP status codes to indicate an error. Whenever you receive a status code while trying to run a request, you'll also receive an error message. These errors relate to *authentication*, *limits*, *access*, or query and GraphQL *construction* issues.

You can receive the following status codes and error messages in a query format:

| Status code | Error Response                                                                                                                  | Motive                                                                               |

| 400         | To execute queries it is mandatory to provide the desired time interval.                                                     | The `tsRange` or `tsGt + tsLt` fields weren't informed in the query.             |
| 400  | The start and end dates must have the same timezone. | The timezone entered in the `tsRange` or `tsGt` and `tsLt` fields are different. Use the timestamp in UTC format. Example: `"2023-10-10T10:47:00"`

| 400         | Cannot query field\"[value]\" on type \"[value]".                                                                               | A non-existing field, indicated in the error response, was used in the request.      |
| 400         | Unknown argument \"[value]" on field \"[value]" of type \"Query\". Did you mean \"[value]"?                                      | An invalid argument, indicated in the error response, was used in the query.         |
| 401         | The authentication could not be performed. Reason : Invalid Token                                                               | An invalid token was informed.                                                       |

If you receive any of the described error responses, see the rest of the [GraphQL API documentation](/en/documentation/products/graphql-api/) to find specifications and correct your request.
