Queries are essential for the use of the **GraphQL API**. With that in mind, Azion created a dedicated repository so you can easily find queries examples, adapt them to use with the GraphQL API, and consult your data on Azion products.

Access the [GitHub azion-queries repository to view examples](https://github.com/aziontech/azion-queries).

In the repository, you can find examples for queries related to several products, such as:

- Data Streaming
- Edge Application
- Top X Queries
- Edge Functions

The examples are constantly being updated and improved. Make sure you see them to discover more and make a better use of the GraphQL API. You can also submit changes to the repository to be reviewed by the Azion team.
