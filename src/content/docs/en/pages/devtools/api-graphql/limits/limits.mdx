To keep **GraphQL API** working with enhanced performance, the API has predetermined limits you must pay attention to. See which are these limits next.

---

## Query rows limit

You can query up to *10,000 rows per query*. The **limit** field in your query controls this restriction, and you can set it as you desire as long as it doesnâ€™t surpass the limit. If you surpass it, the API will return an error response message informing the issue.

---

## Selected fields limit Real-Time Metrics GraphQL API

The maximum value of selected fields for a dataset is of *35 fields per query* in the Real-Time Metrics GQL. If you surpass the fields' limit, the API will return an error response message informing the issue.

---

## Selected fields limit Real-Time Events GraphQL API

The maximum value of selected fields for a dataset is of *10 fields per query* in the Real-Time Events GQL. If you surpass the fields' limit, the API will return an error response message informing the issue. If you need to analyze more fields, create different queries.
