To keep **GraphQL API** working with enhanced performance, the API has predetermined limits you must pay attention to. See which are these limits next.

---

## Query rows limit

You can query up to *10,000 rows per query*. The **limit** field in your query controls this restriction, and you can set it as you desire as long as it doesn’t surpass the limit. If you surpass it, the API will return an error response message informing the issue.

---

## Selected fields limit

The maximum value of selected fields for a dataset is of *37 fields per query* in the Real-Time Metrics GQL and Real-Time Events GQL. If you surpass the fields' limit, the API will return an error response message informing the issue.

See the [Error Responses](/en/documentation/devtools/graphql-api/error-responses/) page for more details on the messages regarding limit errors.
