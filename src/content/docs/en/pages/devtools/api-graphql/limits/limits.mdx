To keep **GraphQL API** working with enhanced performance, the API has predetermined limits you must pay attention to. See which are these limits next.

---

## Query rows limit

You can query up to *10,000 rows per query*. The **limit** field in your query controls this restriction, and you can set it as you desire as long as it doesnâ€™t surpass the limit. If you surpass it, the API will return an error response message informing the issue.

---

## Selected fields limit

The maximum value of selected fields for a dataset is *37 fields per query* in the Real-Time Metrics GQL and Real-Time Events GQL. If you surpass the fields' limit, the API will return an error response message informing the issue.

---

See the [Error Responses](/en/documentation/devtools/graphql-api/error-responses/) page for more details on the messages regarding limit errors.
