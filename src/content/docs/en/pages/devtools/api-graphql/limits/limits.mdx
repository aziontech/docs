To keep **GraphQL API** working with enhanced performance, the API has predetermined limits you must pay attention to. See which are these limits next.

---

## Query rows limit

You can query up to *10,000 rows per query*. The **limit** field in your query controls this restriction, and you can set it as you desire as long as it doesn’t surpass the limit. If you surpass it, the API will return an error response message informing the issue.

## Selected fields limit Real-Time Metrics GraphQL API

The maximum value of selected fields for a dataset is of *35 fields per query* in the Real-Time Metrics GQL. If you surpass the fields' limit, the API will return an error response message informing the issue.

---

## Selected fields limit Real-Time Events GraphQL API

The maximum value of selected fields for a dataset is of *10 fields per query* in the Real-Time Events GQL. If you surpass the fields' limit, the API will return an error response message informing the issue. If you need to analyze more fields, create different queries.
