Queries are the starting point to begin consulting information as you use a query to request information from a database. The **GraphQL API** relies on queries to fetch values and send the requested data as a response with a similar format in a JSON file.

The use of queries enables requesting and fetching specific data. This means you can get a response to your request even with a small query if you don't want to see data that isn't essential at that moment. Using queries also means you get faster responses, as the GraphQL API doesn't need to fetch unnecessary amount of data.

By using queries, your requests and responses also become more organized. Due to GraphQL's ability to adapt, you can make several calls to the API and still receive only the data you requested in an organized JSON result.

You can use queries for two types of data:

- **Raw**, using the Real-Time Events GraphQL API.
- **Aggregated**, using the Real-Time Metrics GraphQL API.

For each type of data, you'll query with different [GraphQL datasets](/en/documentation/products/graphql-api-features/#datasets).

:::tip
See all [GraphQL API limits](/en/documentation/products/graphql-api-limits/) to make sure your query is valid.
:::

### Raw data

Raw data exhibit your event records without any further processing. They provide detailed information and are helpful when performing deep-dive investigations.

Here's an example of a raw Real-Time Events GraphQL query:

```graphql
query HttpQuery {
  httpEvents(
    limit: 10,
    filter: {
      tsRange: {begin:"2023-02-14T10:10:10", end:"2023-02-15T10:10:10"}
    }
    orderBy: [ts_ASC]
  ) 
  {
    ts
    remoteAddress
    requestUri
    stacktrace
  }
}
```

And the response to the query:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "httpEvents": [
      {
        "ts": "2023-08-08T10:10:10Z",
        "remoteAddress": "xx.xx.xxx.xxx",
        "requestUri": "/hello.index/verify",
        "stacktrace": "-"
      },
      {
        "ts": "2023-08-08T10:10:10Z",
        "remoteAddress": "yyy.y.yyy.yyyy",
        "requestUri": "/hello.index/welcome",
        "stacktrace": "-"
      },
      {
        "ts": "2023-08-08T10:10:10Z",
        "remoteAddress": "zzz.zzz.zz.zz",
        "requestUri": "/api/verify=pPrt%20",
        "stacktrace": "-"
      },
      {
        "ts": "2023-08-08T10:10:10Z",
        "remoteAddress": "xyz.xy.zxy.zxy",
        "requestUri": "/helloaspx.index/search",
        "stacktrace": "-"
      },
      {
        "ts": "2023-08-08T10:10:10Z",
        "remoteAddress": "zyx.z.yxz.yxz",
        "requestUri": "/hello.css/analysis",
        "stacktrace": "-"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

To query raw data, it's *mandatory* to inform:

- A time range interval for all datasets, using either **tsRange** or **tsGt** + **tsLt**.
- Which consulted data should be exhibited. On the presented example, the **ts**, **remoteAddress**, **requestUri**, and **stacktrace** fields were used.

:::tip
You can also use the **Top X query** feature with the Real-Time Events GraphQL API. It helps to visualize how resources and tools are being used and provide a more detailed analysis of certain conditions that are either more or less commonly used. For example, you can query for “Top 10 Hosts” or “Top 10 Status Codes”.

### Aggregated data

Aggregated data are a type of structured data that have been clustered. They go through modifications to allow a better analytic processing seeking a segmented analysis, making it easier to visualize even great amount of data over a larger period of time.

Here's an example of an aggregated Real-Time Metrics GraphQL query:

```graphql
query HttpQuery {
  httpMetrics(
    limit: 10,
    filter: {
      tsRange: {begin:"2022-03-21T10:10:10", end:"2023-09-08T10:10:10"}
    }
    aggregate: {sum: requestTime}
    groupBy: [ts]
    orderBy: [ts_ASC]
  )
  {
    ts
    sum
  }
}
```

And the response to the query:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "httpMetrics": [
            {
                "ts": "2022-11-29T00:00:00Z",
                "sum": 0.529
            },
            {
                "ts": "2022-11-30T00:00:00Z",
                "sum": 0.044
            },
            {
                "ts": "2023-04-11T00:00:00Z",
                "sum": 50.728
            },
            {
                "ts": "2023-04-13T00:00:00Z",
                "sum": 1.683
            },
            {
                "ts": "2023-04-21T00:00:00Z",
                "sum": 0.341
            },
            {
                "ts": "2023-05-22T00:00:00Z",
                "sum": 346.432
            },
            {
                "ts": "2023-06-05T00:00:00Z",
                "sum": 23.934
            },
            {
                "ts": "2023-06-06T00:00:00Z",
                "sum": 64.223
            },
            {
                "ts": "2023-06-07T00:00:00Z",
                "sum": 12.818
            },
            {
                "ts": "2023-06-09T00:00:00Z",
                "sum": 4.073
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

To query aggregated data, it's *mandatory* to inform:

- A time range interval for all datasets, using either **tsRange** or **tsGt** + **tsLt**.
- The fields whose information you want to group, using **groupBy**.
- Which consulted data should be shown. On the presented example, the **ts** and **sum** fields were used, in which **sum** represents the response of the **requestTime** aggregation.

There are also a few options that you must inform through the **aggregate** field in your query:

| Identifier | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Count | Determines the total value of records meeting a specific condition. |
| Sum | Returns the sum of the entry values of a column or expression. |
| Max | Returns the maximum value of a determined field of a table according to the established selection criteria. |
| Min | Returns the minimum value of a determined field of a table according to the established selection criteria. |
| Avg | Calculates the arithmetic mean of a set of values in a specific field being consulted. |
| Rate | Used for the imagesProcessed dataset. Obtains the rate of images being processed by second while using Image Processor. |

Find more information and examples in the [How to query aggregated data with GraphQL API](/en/documentation/products/guides/graphql-aggregated-data/) guide.

You can run a request with *one of each* of the available options: **count**, **sum**, **max**, **min**, **avg**, and **rate**, as long as each option is only used *once* and each operator aggregates only *one dataset* field at a time. See the following example:

```graphql
aggregate: {
    count: rows, 
    sum: bytesSent, 
    avg: requestTime, 
    max: requestLength,
    min: missedData,
    rate: requestTime
}
```

With the *aggregated model*, you'll receive data according to a time range defined through an *adaptive resolver*. There are three possible intervals to fetch your results: *minute*, *hour*, and *day*.

| Interval | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Minute | Used for queries in the interval of **up to 3 days**. |
| Hour | Used for queries in the interval of **3 and 60 days**. |
| Day | Used for queries in the interval of **over 60 days**. |

## Operators

Operators are special keys that allow you to customize your query to perform from basic to more complex logical comparisons. You can use them for both the Real-Time Metrics GraphQL API and the Real-Time Events GraphQL API.

Depending on the operator you use, you'll change the condition you're querying for and receive different results. The following operators can be used with GraphQL:

| Key | Description | GraphQL Operator |
| --- | ----------- | --------------- |
| eq | Consults data that are an exact match, *equal*, to the specified value. | `Eq` |
| ne | Consults data that are different, *not equal*, from the specified value. | `Ne` |
| like | Consults data that are *like* the specified value, with case-sensitive values. | `Like` |
| ilike | Consults data that are *insensitive like* the specified value, with case-insensitive values. | `Ilike` |
| is_null | Consults data that *are null* or *aren't null* compared to the specified value, using `true` or `false`. | `IsNull` |
| in | Consults data contained in a given list, *in*, the specified value. | `In` |
| not_in | Consults data that aren't in a given list, *not in*, the specified value. | `NotIn` |
| lt | Consults data with values smaller than, *less than*, the specified value. | `Lt` |
| lte | Consults data with values smaller or equal, *less than or equal*, to the specified value. | `Lte` |
| gt | Consults data with values larger, *greater than*, the specified value. | `Gt` |
| gte | Consults data with values larger or equal, *greater than or equal*, to the specified value. | `Gte` |
| range | Consults data that are part of the *range* of the specified values. | `Range` |

If you're using the `Like` and `Ilike` operators, you must also pass the identifier `%` inside the field in the position you want to use:

| Identifier position | Description | Example |
| ------------------ | ----------- | -------- |
| End | Any string that starts with the characters. | "Braz%" |
| Beginning | Any string that ends with the characters. | "%ao Paulo" |
| End and beginning | Any string that contains the characters. | "%ttp%" |

Here are a few examples of fields with an operator:

| Operator | Example | Description |
| -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| Eq | upstreamCacheStatusEq: "HIT" | Searches everything that matches exactly the `HIT` value in the upstreamCacheStatus field. |
| Ne | geolocCountryNameNe: "Brazil" | Searches everything that isn't `Brazil` in the geolocCountryName field. |
| Like | hostLike: "%mysite.com%" | Searches everything for hosts with the particular `mysite.com` pattern and is *case-sensitive.* |
| Ilike | hostIlike: "%mysite.com%" | Searches everything for hosts with the particular `mysite.com` pattern and is *case-insensitive*. |

Depending on the [type of field of a dataset](/en/documentation/products/graphql-api-features/#datasets) you're querying for, you'll get to use different operators:

| Field type | Possible operators |
| --- | ----------- |
| String | `Eq`, `Ne`, `Like`, `Ilike`, `In`, `NotIn`, `IsNull`  |
| Integer, Float, DateTime | `Eq`, `Lt`, `Lte`, `Gt`, `Gte`, `Ne`, `In`, `NotIn`, `IsNull`, `Range` |
