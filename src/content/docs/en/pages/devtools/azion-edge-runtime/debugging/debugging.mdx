Debugging is a process that allows developers to fix log messages or variables, for example. The debugging method allows **Edge Functions** users to generate logs as if they were using a browser's JavaScript.

---

## What it is

The debugging process in **Edge Functions** has the purpose of promoting better control over the application to identify errors. It can also be used to assist in the development and debugging of a function, resulting in greater observability.

---

## How it works

To debug codes, you must create a new function that will use the **log** method. This function prints to a local file a message that was previously sent by a parameter to the function.

Check the use of the `console_from_event.log` function below:

```js
   async function handleRequest(request, console_from_event) {
       console_from_event.log("Hello World");

       return new Response("Checking console output.", {
           status: 200,
       });
   }
   addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {
       event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request, event.console));
   });
```

The message is then collected and made available to be accessed on [Data Streaming](/en/documentation/products/data-streaming/).

## Setting up

1. Access [Real-Time Manager](https://sso.azion.com/login) with your login credentials.
2. On the upper left corner, select **Products Menu** > **Observe** > **Data Streaming**.
3. Select an existing template or create a new one by clicking the **Add Streaming** button.
4. Fill out the following fields with the necessary information:

**Name for Data Streaming**: Define a name for your template.

**Data**

**Data Source**: this is the Azion platform that will generate the events from which you are collecting data.

**Template**: the definition of the variables. Select **Custom Template** to create a new data set and include the variables below into the **Data Set** box:

| **Variable**      | **Definition**                                              |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| $time             | Date and time of the request.                               |
| $global_id        | Settings identifier.                                        |
| $edge_function_id | Edge Function identifier.                                   |
| $request_id       | Request identifier.                                         |
| $log_level        | Level of the log created (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE). |
| $log_message      | Message used on the log when the function is requested.     |

**Options**: where data will be collected. It's possible to filter the domains (**Filter Domains**) or select all (**All Domains**) by choosing one option.

> This option will appear only if you have more than one domain set up.

**Domains**: in case you wish to specify which domains, select them on the displayed boxes.

**Sampling**: the definition of % of data that will be transmitted. You can only change this value when selecting All Domains in the Options field.

> This option will appear only if you have more than one domain set up.

**Destination**

**Endpoint Type**: the method by which your endpoint will receive the data collected by Data Streaming. Select an option.

**Endpoint URL**: the URL that will receive information transmitted by Data Streaming. Define the URL.

**Custom Headers**: include here the need to add headers at requests.

5. Click the **Save** button to finish the process.
