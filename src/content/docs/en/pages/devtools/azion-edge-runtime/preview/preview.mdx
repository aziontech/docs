**Azion Preview Deployment** makes it possible for you to preview the behavior of your edge functions before they go to production. New possibilities are unlocked when using the Preview, such as:

- Test different flows based on the http method provided.
- See the outcome of an HTML page.
- Return data in JSON.

## How does Azion Preview Deployment work?

Azion Preview Deployment depends on an auxiliary function inside your source code. This function is called `PreviewProvider`, and it's responsible for debugging and simulating a request, returning the outcome to be rendered. The `PreviewProvider` function is represented as:

```js
    function PreviewProvider<PreviewProvider>(args) {
        var request = new Request("https://azion.com/example", {
            method: "GET",
            headers: {
                "Content-Type": "application/json",
                "Authorization": "Bearer my-token"
            },
            redirect: "follow",
        });
        return handleRequest(request);
    }
```

>**Note**: without the `PreviewProvider` function, it isn't possible to visualize the preview.

Now, with your simulated request running, you're able to set different behaviors to your function, based on all properties available inside the request variable, such as:

```js
    async function handleRequest(request){
        switch (request.Method){
            case 'GET':
             return new Response(html,{
                headers:{
                    "content-type":"text/html:charset=UTF-8",
                }
             })
        }
    }
```

In this code snippet, it's defined that if a `GET` request is called, it returns the `HTML` var, containing the html to be output, and set its content type as required to perform this action.

### API Builder

It's also possible to build APIs and have the outcome based on the request method. For example:

- You can have an object in `JSON` as the response, if the request is a `POST`, by altering the `content-type` header and returning the object using the `JSON.stringify()` function.

- In case the request is a `GET`, and you wish to return an HTML page, the `content-type` should be set as `text/html:charset=UTF-8`. The response is going to be presented already rendered on the preview.

Example:

```js
    async function handleRequest(request){
        switch (request.Method){
            case 'POST':
             return new Response(objectList,{
                headers:{
                    "content-type":"application/json",
                }
             })
            case 'GET':
             return new Response(html,{
                headers:{
                    "content-type":"text/html:charset=UTF-8",
                }
            })
        }
    }
```

The output is shown right next to the code editor. It's possible to open it on a different tab as well, clicking on the **open** button.
