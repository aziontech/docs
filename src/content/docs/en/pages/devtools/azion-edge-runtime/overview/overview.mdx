The **Azion Runtime** is a set of tools for developing applications at the **Edge**. The Azion Runtime allows you to write JavaScript [functions](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-functions/) built on Web standards.

**Functions** help you to implement the business logic and create serverless applications, at the edge of the network, closer to users.

With Azion Runtime, you can use a set of **Web APIs**, such as:

- Network
- Encoding and Decoding
- Web Streams
- Standards
- V8 Primitives

## Strict mode 

Azion makes strict mode the default and required option for type checking JavaScript code. The Azion core team strongly advocates for strict mode as the sensible default choice. This mode empowers developers with essential JavaScript features that ideally should have been available from the beginning. However, as JavaScript evolved over time, incorporating these features would have introduced breaking changes to existing codebases.

Strict mode makes several changes to normal JavaScript semantics:
- Eliminates some JavaScript silent errors by changing them to throw errors.
- Fixes mistakes that make it difficult for JavaScript engines to perform optimizations: strict mode code can sometimes be made to run faster than identical code that's not strict mode.
- Prohibits some syntax likely to be defined in future versions of ECMAScript.
