title: "   Next.js App + Middleware"
description: >-
  The Next.js App + Middleware accelerates the deployment of a Next.js application with custom configurations, App Router, and a middleware to run it directly at the edge. Next.js App + Middleware creates files to implement the App Router format, with the index page, edge API routing, and Custom Route Handler created in the new repository during the deployment. It also includes a middleware that allows you to modify the response for a request and control different aspects of the application, such as performing redirects, setting headers, and others.
