## About Angular

[Angular](https://angular.io/) is a comprehensive platform for building web applications. It's a complete solution that includes everything you need to build client-side applications, from development tools to testing utilities. Angular uses TypeScript as its primary language and follows a component-based architecture with a robust dependency injection system.

**Key features:**

- Full-featured framework with built-in tools and utilities
- Component-based architecture with TypeScript support
- Powerful dependency injection system
- Built-in routing and form handling
- Reactive programming with RxJS integration
- Built-in state management capabilities

You can deploy your Angular project either by using our ready to deploy templates or by linking an existing project with the Azion CLI.

## Available Templates

| Template name | Use case | Details |
|:-------------|:---------|:-----|
| Angular Boilerplate | Starter project | <LinkButton link="/en/documentation/products/templates/angular-boilerplate/" label="Learn more" severity="secondary" /> |
| ButterCMS + Angular Starter Project | Starter Project | <LinkButton link="/en/documentation/products/templates/angular-buttercms/" label="Learn more" severity="secondary" /> |
| Clean Angular + Sanity app | Starter Project | <LinkButton link="/en/documentation/products/templates/angular-sanity/" label="Learn more" severity="secondary" /> |


### Deploying a template using Azion Console

1. Login to [Console](https://console.azion.com).
2. Click the **\+ Create** button.
3. Click the **Templates** section.
4. Choose the desired Angular template.
5. Connect your GitHub Account.
6. Choose a name for your application.
7. Click **Deploy**.

### Deploying an existing project using Import from GitHub

2. In [Console](https://console.azion.com) click the **\+ Create** button.  
3. Select **Import from Github**.  
4. Select your repository.  
5. Choose an application name.
6. Select the **Angular Preset**.
7. Input the install command:

```
npm install
```
8. Click **Deploy**

### Deploying a template using Azion CLI

:::tip
Visit our [CLI guide](/en/documentation/products/azion-cli/overview/#installing-azion-cli) for detailed installation instructions.
:::

1. Initialize the project:

```sh 
  azion init
```

2. Give your project a name, or press `enter` to accept the given suggestion:

```sh 
? Your application's name:  (black-thor) 
```

3. Choose the Angular preset: 

```sh 
? Choose a preset:  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
> Angular
  Astro
  Docusaurus
  Eleventy
  Emscripten
  Gatsby
  Hexo
  Hono
  Hugo
  Javascript
  ...
```

4. Choose one of the available templates.

5. With the template fetched and configured, you can now start a local development server.

```sh 
Do you want to start a local development server? (y/N) 
```

The following steps are based on the answer you gave. 

- [If you chose to have a local development server running](#answering-yes-to-local-dev).
- [If you chose not to have a local development server running](#answering-no-to-local-dev).

### Answering yes to local dev

1. Install the project dependencies. Input `y` when the interaction prompts:

```sh 
  Do you want to install project dependencies? This may be required to start local development server (y/N)
```

Wait until the installation is complete.

Output:

```sh
Your Edge Application was built successfully
[Azion] [Server] › ✔  success   Function running on port 0.0.0.0:3333, url: http://localhost:3333
```

2. On the browser, go to `http://localhost:3333/` and you can see your Angular project running.

#### Deploying the project

When your project is running locally, you're still able to deploy it to the edge. To do so: 

1. Stop the terminal execution with `control + c`. 
2. Access the project folder:

```sh
cd [your-project-name] 
```

3. Deploy the project: 

```sh
azion deploy
```

4. Wait while the project is built and deployed to the Azion Web Platform.

:::note 
Once the deployment is triggered, Azion will open the browser and take the user to a page on Azion Console where the deployment logs and process can be monitored. If it doesn't open automatically, just click on the provided link.
::: 

After the deployment is complete, you'll receive a domain to access your Angular project on the Azion's platform.

Wait a few minutes so the propagation takes place, and then access your application using the provided domain, which should be similar to `https://xxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`.

### Answering no to local dev

After indicating you don't want to have a local server running, deploy the Angular project to the edge. 

1. Enter `y` to the following interaction, indicating you want to deploy the project:

```sh
   Do you want to deploy your project? (y/N) 
```

2. Install the project dependencies. Input `y` when the interaction prompts:

```sh 
  Do you want to install project dependencies? This may be required to deploy your project (y/N)
```

3. Wait while the project is built and deployed to the Azion Web Platform.

:::note 
Once the deployment is triggered, Azion will open the browser and take the user to a page on Azion Console where the deployment logs and process can be monitored. If it doesn't open automatically, just click on the provided link.
::: 

After the deployment is complete, you'll receive a domain to access your Angular project on the Azion Web Platform.

Wait a few minutes so the propagation takes place, and then access your application using the provided domain, which should be similar to `https://xxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`.

### Local project deploy with Azion CLI

You can use the Azion CLI to deploy a project compatible with our [availiable frameworks](/en/documentation/products/devtools/azion-edge-runtime/frameworks-compatibility/).

:::tip
Visit our [CLI guide](/en/documentation/products/azion-cli/overview/#installing-azion-cli) for detailed installation instructions.
:::

1. Inside your existing project folder, use the command below to link your project to an edge application:

```shell
azion link
```

2. Choose the Angular preset.

3. The CLI will guide you through the rest of the process. In less than five minutes, your application can be up and running on the Azion Web Platform.
