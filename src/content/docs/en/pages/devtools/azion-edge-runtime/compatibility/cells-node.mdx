## Node built-in

The compatibility between **Azion Runtime** and **Node.js** is an ongoing task, but a set of Node Runtime APIs are listed and compatible with Azion Runtime. The following list of APIs can be imported inside edge functions with the standard import syntax:

```js
import { API } from "import-origin";
```

| API | Support Level | Code sample  | Comments |
|---------|---------------|----------|-------------|
| async_hooks | 游리 Partially supported | [Access code sample](https://github.com/aziontech/azion-samples/tree/dev/samples/node-async-hooks) | Only [AsyncLocalStorage](https://nodejs.org/api/async_context.html#class-asynclocalstorage) and [AsyncResource](https://nodejs.org/api/async_hooks.html#class-asyncresource) are implemented |

## Node polyfills

A polyfill is a code snippet, often used in JavaScript, that brings new features to environments lacking these capabilities. Polyfills are used during build time at Azion and can be configured through the [vulcan.config.js](/en/documentation/devtools/vulcan/config/) file.

Here's a list of Node APIs supported through polyfills:
