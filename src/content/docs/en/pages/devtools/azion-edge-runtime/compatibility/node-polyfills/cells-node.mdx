## Node.js APIs supported in Azion Runtime

The compatibility between **Azion Runtime** and **Node.js** is an ongoing task, but a set of Node Runtime APIs are listed and compatible with Azion Runtime. The following list of APIs can be imported inside edge functions with the standard import syntax:

```js
import { API } from "import-origin";
```

| API | Support Level | Code sample  | Comments |
|---------|---------------|----------|-------------|
| async_hooks | 游리 Partially supported Partially supported | [Access code sample](https://github.com/aziontech/azion-samples/tree/dev/samples/node-async-hooks) | Only [AsyncLocalStorage](https://nodejs.org/api/async_context.html#class-asynclocalstorage) and [AsyncResource](https://nodejs.org/api/async_hooks.html#class-asyncresource) are implemented. |
| fs | 游리 Partially supported Partially supported| | Only async methods ([check the list below](#fs-support)), others through [polyfills](#node-polyfills). |
| module | 游리 Partially supported Partially supported | | Also supported in local dev through polyfills ([check table below](#node-polyfills)). |
| process.env | 游릭 Supported Supported | `process.env.VAR_NAME`| Other features supported through polyfills ([check table below](#node-polyfills)). |
| url | 游리 Partially supported Partially supported | | Only global `URL` and `URLSearchParams`. |

### File System (FS) module support

The Azion Runtime provides native support for the File System (FS) module, allowing you to interact with the file system within your edge functions.

 Async:

| Method                          | Parameters                                   | Description                                          |

## Supported Node APIs with polyfills

A polyfill is a code snippet, often used in JavaScript, that brings new features to environments lacking these capabilities. Polyfills are used during build time at Azion and can be configured through the [azion.config.js](/en/documentation/devtools/cli/configs/azion-config-js/) file.

The following Node APIs are supported through polyfills, along with their respective supported methods.
