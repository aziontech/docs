## Compute x Deliver

Azion employs the terminology `compute` and `deliver` to describe the operational modes of applications within its framework:

| Mode | Description |
|-     |-            |
| Compute | Designed for applications that require computational processing at the edge, whether it's for Front-End Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Back-End tasks. In Compute Mode, Azion enables the execution of code and processing of dynamic content at the edge to enhance performance and responsiveness. | 
| Deliver (static) | Tailored for frameworks that primarily focus on handling and routing incoming requests at the edge, with an emphasis on efficiently **serving static files**. While applications in Deliver Mode don't execute dynamic code, they excel in optimizing the delivery of static content to end-users, thereby ensuring smooth and fast content distribution. |
