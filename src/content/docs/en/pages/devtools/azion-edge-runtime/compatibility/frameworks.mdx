## [Vulcan](https://github.com/aziontech/vulcan)

[Vulcan](https://github.com/aziontech/vulcan) is Azion's framework adapter built to run on our Edge Runtime. It's an evolving project aimed at supporting various JavaScript frameworks. The project is open source and encourages community contributions.

Azion provides different ways to get started and work with web frameworks: 

- [Azion CLI](/en/documentation/products/azion-cli/overview/)
- [Real-Time Manager](/en/documentation/products/start-with-a-template/)

## Compute x Deliver

Azion employs the terminology `compute` and `deliver` to describe the operational modes of applications within its framework:

| Mode | Description |
|-     |-            |
|Compute | This mode is designed for applications that require computational processing at the Edge, whether it's for Front-End Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Back-End tasks. In Compute Mode, Azion enables the execution of code and processing of dynamic content at the Edge to enhance performance and responsiveness. | 
|Deliver | Deliver Mode is tailored for frameworks that primarily focus on handling and routing incoming requests at the Edge, with an emphasis on efficiently **serving static files**. While applications in Deliver Mode do not execute dynamic code, they excel in optimizing the delivery of static content to end-users, thereby ensuring smooth and fast content distribution. |

## Next.js 

**SSR** 
(compute)

For Next.js Server-side rendering, Azion supports:

- Next.js **version 12.3.1**
- Pages router
- Next Node runtime version 12.3.1
- Pages format
- Index page (static)
- API Route 
- SSR page
- Dynamic route
- Nested route

**Currently the following implementations are in progress and aren't supported yet**:

- Edge Runtime
- Next.js 13.x.y features (example: `app router`)

:::note
If the Next.js project isn't in **v12.3.1**, the build process won't work.
