## Azion Bundler

[Azion Bundler](https://github.com/aziontech/bundler) is the framework adapter built to run on Azion Runtime. It's an evolving project aimed at supporting various JavaScript frameworks. The project is open source and encourages community contributions.

Azion provides different ways to get started and work with web frameworks: 

- [Azion CLI](/en/documentation/products/azion-cli/overview/)
- [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/start-with-a-template/)

## Compute x Deliver

Azion employs the terminology `compute` and `deliver` to describe the operational modes of applications within its framework:

| Mode | Description |
|-     |-            |
| Compute | Designed for applications that require computational processing at the edge, whether it's for Front-End Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Back-End tasks. In Compute Mode, Azion enables the execution of code and processing of dynamic content at the edge to enhance performance and responsiveness. | 
| Deliver (static) | Tailored for frameworks that primarily focus on handling and routing incoming requests at the edge, with an emphasis on efficiently **serving static files**. While applications in Deliver Mode don't execute dynamic code, they excel in optimizing the delivery of static content to end-users, thereby ensuring smooth and fast content distribution. |
