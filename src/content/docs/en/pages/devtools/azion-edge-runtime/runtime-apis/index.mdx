The **JavaScript Runtime Environment** is a set of APIs that are available as tools for the development of functions.

You can deploy projects using the Azion Edge Infrastructure, and automatically provision what is needed for your code to run on a low latency rate, closer to the users.

## EdgeRuntime property

The EdgeRuntime property can be accessed in different ways:

```js
    if (typeof EdgeRuntime !== 'string') {
    // Your logic here.
    }
```

```js
    if (typeof globalThis.EdgeRuntime !== 'string') {
    // Your logic here.
    }
```

```js
   if (typeof self.EdgeRuntime !== 'string') {
    // Your logic here.
   }
```
