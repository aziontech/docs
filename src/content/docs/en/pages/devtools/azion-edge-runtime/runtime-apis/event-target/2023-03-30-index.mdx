The EventTarget interface is used by objects that can receive events and have listeners set up to handle those events. This interface provides three methods that are implemented by any event target. The most commonly used event targets are [element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element) and their children, as well as [Document](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document) and [Window](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document). However, other objects such as XMLHttpRequest, AudioNode, and AudioContext can also be event targets.

In addition to implementing the EventTarget interface, many event targets like elements, documents, and windows also allow setting [event handlers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/Event_handlers) through "onevent" properties and attributes.
