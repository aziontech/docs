The WritableStream interface is a part of the Streams API that provides a standardized way to write streaming data to a sink (destination). It comes with its own queuing and backpressure mechanism to ensure that the data is written in an efficient way.

## Constructor

[WritableStream()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WritableStream/WritableStream)
Creates a new writable object.

## Instance properties

[WritableStream.locked](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WritableStream/locked)
A boolean indicating whether the WritableStream is locked to a writer.

## Instance methods

[WritableStream.abort()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WritableStream/abort)
Aborts the stream, signaling that the producer can no longer successfully write to the stream and it's to be immediately moved to an error state, with any queued writes discarded.

[WritableStream.close()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WritableStream/close)
Closes the stream.

[WritableStream.getWriter()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WritableStream/getWriter)
Returns a new instance of WritableStreamDefaultWriter and locks the stream to that instance. While the stream is locked, no other writer can be acquired until this one is released.
