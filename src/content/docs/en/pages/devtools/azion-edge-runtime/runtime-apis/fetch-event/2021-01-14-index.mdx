## How it works

FetchEvent is the event that passes the request through the *addEventListener* function. The *addEventListener*, in turn, defines the trigger for executing the JavaScript code and receives the request data.

## Syntax

```js
  addEventListener(type, listener)
```

## Properties

event.type: `fetch`

event.request: `request`  - the HTTP request received by the Edge Function.

## Methods

When the Edge Function receives a request, the Runtime executes the FetchEvent, which can be manipulated by the eventListener of a `fetch` type that, in turn, can call the method that defines what will happen until the response:

```js
event.respondWith(response Request|Promise) // the HTTP request received by the Edge Function.
```

## Example

```js
  addEventListener("fetch", event => {
    event.respondWith(handleRequest(event))
  })
```
