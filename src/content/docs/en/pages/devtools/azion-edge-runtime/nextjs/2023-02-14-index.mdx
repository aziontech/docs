## OpenNext

The [`@aziontech/opennextjs-azion`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aziontech/opennextjs-azion) adapter lets you deploy Next.js apps to [Azion Functions](https://www.azion.com/en/products/edge-functions/) using the [Node.js "runtime" from Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/edge-and-nodejs-runtimes).

### Get Started

##### New apps

To create a new Next.js app, pre-configured to run on Azion using `@aziontech/opennextjs-azion`, run:

```shell
npx create-next-app@14.2.4 my-next-app --use-npm && cd my-next-app && npm install @aziontech/opennextjs-azion@latest
```

##### Existing Next.js apps

[Follow the guide here](/azion/get-started) to use [@aziontech/opennextjs-azion](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aziontech/opennextjs-azion) with an existing Next.js app.

### Supported Next.js versions

All minor and patch versions of Next.js 15 and the latest minor of Next.js 14 are supported.

To help improve compatibility, we encourage you to [report bugs](https://github.com/aziontech/opennextjs-azion/issues) and contribute code!

:::note
Azion Functions have a maximum size limit of 50 MB per function. After building your project, pay attention to the compressed (gzipped) size of your deployment packageâ€”only the compressed size counts toward this limit.
For more details, see the [documentation on Function size limits](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-functions/#limits).

### Examples

To create a new Next.js app for Azion, you can use the following starter projects and templates:

#### Basic starter projects

- [Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind Template](https://github.com/aziontech/azion-samples/tree/dev/templates/opennextjs/nextal-next-typescript-tailwind) â€” a ready-to-use template for building modern Next.js apps on Azion Functions.
- [Node Playground (Next.js 13)](https://github.com/aziontech/bundler-examples/tree/main/examples/nextjs/node-playground-13) â€” an example showing how to run Next.js 13 in a Node.js environment on Azion.

You can use these repositories to understand how to configure your Next.js app to run on Azion, or as a starting point for your own projects.

### Known issues

#### TS Config
- Your `tsconfig.json` must include the following setting:
  
```json
"moduleResolution": "bundler"
```
  
 If this is not set, you may encounter issues during the build or runtime process.

- There is a known issue with ESM and the `open-next.config.ts` file. If you have an older project or one that depends on a specific TypeScript version or custom configuration, you may need to:
  - Reconfigure your project (for example, by setting `moduleResolution: bundler` as above), **or**
  - Add the following to your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
"exclude": ["node_modules", "open-next.config.ts"]
```

Whether this works depends on your project setup. In some cases, excluding `open-next.config.ts` allows the build to proceed, but you may still encounter errors, especially if your project uses features like `_app.mdx` or other advanced configurations. This is particularly relevant for projects that haven't been tested with these setups, and issues may also occur in other environments (such as the Cloudflare package).

#### Local Development

- Some applications may use Node.js or Web Standard APIs that are not fully supported by Azion's local development environment. However, these features might be available in the actual Azion runtime.

:::tip
If your application does not work as expected during local development, try deploying it to Azion before troubleshooting further, as it may work correctly in the deployed environment.

## About Next.js

**Next.js** is a flexible **React** framework that helps you to build fast and modern applications. It can be used to solve some application requirements such as:

- Routing
- Data Fetching
- Integrations

Next.js allows you to use static generation on a per-page basis, through **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**, without having to rebuild the entire application. That means you can enjoy the benefits of static and still be able to scale.

A **page**, in Next.js, is a **React Component** inside a file. This file can be in any of the following extensions:

- `.js`
- `.jsx`
- `.ts`
- `.tsx`

Every page has an associated *route* based on its file name.

**Example**:

Let's say you create `pages/azion.js` exporting a React component.

```js
  export default function Azion() {
    return <div>The easiest way to build, deploy, observe and secure modern applications.</div>
  }
```

The page will be accessible at `/azion`:

```js
pages/
    azion.js
```

---

## Pre-rendering

Next.js generates HTML for each page in advance, relieving client-side Javascript of this burden. As a consequence, this pre-rendering can help your application have better performance and Search Engine Optimization (SEO).

### Pre-rendering forms

- Static Generation: during build time, the HTML is generated and reused on each request.
- Server-side Rendering: the HTML is generated on each request.
