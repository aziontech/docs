## About Next.js

**Next.js** is a flexible **React** framework that helps you to build fast and modern applications. It can be used to solve some application requirements such as:

- Routing
- Data Fetching
- Integrations

Next.js allows you to use static generation on a per-page basis, through **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**, without having to rebuild the entire application. That means you can enjoy the benefits of static and still be able to scale.

A **page**, in Next.js, is a **React Component** inside a file. This file can be in any of the following extensions:

- `.js`
- `.jsx`
- `.ts`
- `.tsx`

Every page has an associated *route* based on its file name.

**Example**:

Let's say you create `pages/azion.js` exporting a React component.

```js
  export default function Azion() {
    return <div>The easiest way to build, deploy, observe and secure modern applications.</div>
  }
```

The page will be accessible at `/azion`:

```js
pages/
    azion.js
```

## Pre-rendering

Next.js generates HTML for each page in advance, relieving client-side Javascript of this burden. As a consequence, this pre-rendering can help your application have better performance and Search Engine Optimization (SEO).

### Pre-rendering forms

- Static Generation: during build time, the HTML is generated and reused on each request.
- Server-side Rendering: the HTML is generated on each request.
