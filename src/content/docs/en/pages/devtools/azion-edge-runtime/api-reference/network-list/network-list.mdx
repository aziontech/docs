The `Azion.networkList.contains()` interface can be used by edge functions on Edge Firewall to match an IP address against a specific network list. If the IP address informed is within the network list, it returns `true` and the desired implementation logic can go on based on that information.

---

## Syntax

```js
Azion.networkList.contains(networklistID, ipAddress)
```

---

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `networkListId` | string | The ID of the network list to be used for matching. |
| `ipAddress` | string | The IP address to be matched against the network list. |

> **Note**: if the network list ID informed is incorrect, an error is thrown.

Find out more about [Network Lists on the Azion Platform](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/network-layer-protection/network-lists/).

---

## Return value

`bool`: returns `true` if the IP address is in the network list and `false` if it's not.

---

## Usage

Basic usage of `Azion.networkList.contains()` with a specific IP address and network list ID:

```js
    addEventListener("firewall", (event) => {

      let ip = event.request.metadata["remote_addr"] // Accessing the remote address

      try {
        let found = Azion.networkList.contains(String(networkListId), ip); // Checking if the ip is in the list
        if (!found) {
          event.continue(); // If it's not in the list, accept the request
          return;
        }
      } catch (err) {
        event.console.error(`Error: `, err.stack);
      }
      event.deny();
    });
```

:::note 
All edge functions used on Edge Firewall must have a *finishing outcome* in it, such as: `event.continue()`, `event.deny()`, and `event.drop()`.

## Error handling

If an error occurs during the execution of `Azion.networkList.contains()`, an exception may be thrown. Make sure to handle potential errors and provide appropriate error messages or fallback actions in your code.

---

## Best practices

- Regularly update and maintain the network lists to ensure accurate matching and minimize false positives or false negatives.
- Combine network list matching with other security measures for comprehensive protection.
- Ensure the integrity and security of the network lists to prevent unauthorized modifications or access.
- Regularly review and update the network list configurations to address changing security threats and requirements.
