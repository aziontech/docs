Azion provides different ways to get started and work with web frameworks: 

- [Azion CLI]()
- [Real-Time Manager]()

## Next.js 

### SSR 

Next.js provides developers with the flexibility to choose between two distinct file-based routing schemes for building their applications. You can explore detailed information on these routing schemes in the [Pages Router] and [App Router] sections of the Next.js documentation. 

The Azion Edge Runtime supports the following:

- Next.js version 12.3.1
- Pages router
- Next Node runtime version 12.3.1

Currently the following implementations are in progress, and are not supported yet:

- Edge Runtime
- Next.js 13.x.y features
- fonts/google

:::note
If the project is in a different Next.js version, some dependencies won't work and must be resolved.

## Astro

### SSG 

Astro offers a modern and user-friendly method for creating websites. It blends established performance principles from decades of web development with the convenience of component-based development trends. You can use your preferred JavaScript framework and, by default, Astro ensures that only the essential JavaScript is sent to the user.
