Azion provides different ways to get started and work with web frameworks: 

- [Azion CLI]()
- [Real-Time Manager]()

Azion uses the terms `compute` and `deliver` for the applications based on frameworks being initialized or linked to the platform:

- **Compute**: Configurations for frameworks that use computation on the Edge (Front-End SSR or Back-End).
- **Deliver**: Configurations for frameworks that merely handle requests on the Edge to deliver static files (routing, but not execute).


## Next.js 

**SSR** 
(compute)

Next.js provides developers with the flexibility to choose between two distinct file-based routing schemes for building their applications. You can explore detailed information on these routing schemes in the [Pages Router]() `(version <= 12.x.y)` and [App Router]() `(version >= 13)` sections of the Next.js documentation. 

The Azion Edge Runtime supports the following:

- Next.js version 12.3.1
- Pages router
- Next Node runtime version 12.3.1

Currently the following implementations are in progress, and are not supported yet:

- Edge Runtime
- Next.js 13.x.y features (example: `app router`)
- fonts/google

:::note
If the project is in a different Next.js version, some dependencies won't work and must be resolved.
