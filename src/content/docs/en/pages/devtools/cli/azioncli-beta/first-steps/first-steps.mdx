## Installing

### Installing the CLI using the RPM, Dpkg, or apk package managers

1. Go to our [releases page](https://github.com/aziontech/azion-cli/releases) and download the desired package.
2. Execute the command in the **Install Command** column of the table below for the chosen installation package. The **CLI** will be installed automatically.

> **Note**: replace the `<downloaded_file>` placeholder with the installation package file downloaded in step 1.

| Package Manager | Website | Documentation | Install Command |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | -------- | ----------- |
| RPM | [RPM package manager](https://rpm.org/index.html) | [RPM Support Documentation](https://rpm.org/documentation.html) | `sudo rpm -i <downloaded_file>` |
| Dpkg | [Debian&reg; <sup>5</sup> operating system](https://www.debian.org/) | [Dpkg Support Documentation](https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Dpkg)| `sudo dpkg -i <downloaded_file>` |
| apk | [Alpine Linux&reg; <sup>6</sup>operating system](https://docs.alpinelinux.org/user-handbook/0.1a/Working/apk.html) | [support documentation apk](https://docs.alpinelinux.org/user-handbook/0.1a/Working/apk.html) | `apk add <downloaded_file>` |

3. Run the `azioncli --version` command to test the installation. The CLI displays its installed current version number on the terminal.

### Installing the CLI using Homebrew

1. To use Homebrew, visit the [official package installer website](https://brew.sh/) and follow the installation instructions located on its homepage. Then run the Install Command below:

| Package Manager | Website | Documentation | Install Command |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | -------- | ----------- |
| Homebrew | [Homebrew package manager](https://brew.sh/) | [Homebrew Support Documentation](https://docs.brew.sh/Manpage) | `brew install aziontech/tap/azioncli` |

2. Run the `azioncli --version` command to test the installation. The CLI displays its installed current version number on the terminal.

### Alternatives

Alternatively, you can [install Azion CLI manually](/en/documentation/products/guides/cli-installing-manually/).

If you're installing the CLI on a macOS operating system, see [running Azion CLI on macOS](/en/documentation/products/guides/cli-running-macos/).

## Authorization on the Azion Platform

To manage your settings, you must generate a *token* that identifies you on the Azion platform.

> For more information on how to create and manage your *tokens*, use the [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/#aab16606-2014-43d0-9b7a-dc564146a1ac) or see the [Personal Tokens](/en/documentation/products/accounts/personal-tokens/) documentation page.

Once you've created your personal token and have it on your clipboard you can locally store it by using the following command:

```bash
    $ azioncli configure --token <your_token>
```

All subsequent commands will use that same *token* and will consider all permissions granted to the account that *token* belongs to.

> You can replace your *Personal Token* at any time by repeating the command above.
