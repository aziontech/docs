Azion **Command-Line Interface** (CLI) is an [open source](https://github.com/aziontech/azion-cli/) tool that enables the management of services offered by Azion using a terminal. By using the **CLI**, you can create and manage services such as **Edge Functions** and **Edge Services**, as well as the provisioning of **Next.js** applications.

Visit the framework's site at [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for more information.

**Azion CLI** enables you to:

- Manage Azion products.  
- Create automation using scripts or CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery) pipelines.  
- Provision multiple services that make your application up with few commands.
- Manage your Azion settings as code.

For an overview of the **CLI** commands, you can access its [reference documentation](https://github.com/aziontech/azion-cli/wiki/azioncli).

> Azion CLI is currently in **Beta** version. Some functionalities can be modified until its release. Therefore, use it cautiously in production environments. While you try out the **Beta** version, our engineering team would love to hear from you in order to improve it. Contribute with your [feedback](https://forms.gle/uBBkyXZCVcrgpvAB8).

## About Command-Line Interfaces  

Prior to the development of **Graphical User Interfaces** (GUI), software developers and users interacted with computers using a keyboard and monitor, known as **terminal**.

The keyboard served as the input device, on which the user typed command lines. The computer then ran the command and output the result on the monitor screen, eventually with additional messages.

> Commands typed on the keyboard followed rules that enabled creating an interface between the user and the computer. They were usually composed of a keyword, flags, and parameters. This interface, still used today, is the **Command-Line Interface** or **CLI**.

Later, the GUIs attracted to the computer world users who found typing commands complex and challenging. However, the **CLI** has never lost its importance, especially in the software development environment.

In fact, the **CLI** has many advantages when compared to using graphical interfaces, such as:

- Ability to manipulate computer resources inaccessible by GUIs.
- Speed and simplicity to perform tasks.
- Flexibility in creating scripts for process automation.

All modern operating systems have terminal-type applications in which the user can type command lines to perform tasks on the computer.

## Installing

### Installing the CLI using the RPM, Dpkg, or apk package managers

1. Go to our [releases page](https://github.com/aziontech/azion-cli/releases) and download the desired package.
2. Execute the command in the **Install Command** column of the table below for the chosen installation package. The **CLI** will be installed automatically.

> **Note**: replace the `<downloaded_file>` placeholder with the installation package file downloaded in step 1.

| Package Manager | Website | Documentation | Install Command |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | -------- | ----------- |
| RPM | [RPM package manager](https://rpm.org/index.html) | [RPM Support Documentation](https://rpm.org/documentation.html) | `sudo rpm -i <downloaded_file>` |
| Dpkg | [Debian&reg; <sup>5</sup> operating system](https://www.debian.org/) | [Dpkg Support Documentation](https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Dpkg)| `sudo dpkg -i <downloaded_file>` |
| apk | [Alpine Linux&reg; <sup>6</sup>operating system](https://docs.alpinelinux.org/user-handbook/0.1a/Working/apk.html) | [support documentation apk](https://docs.alpinelinux.org/user-handbook/0.1a/Working/apk.html) | `apk add <downloaded_file>` |

3. Run the `azioncli --version` command to test the installation. The CLI displays its installed current version number on the terminal.

### Installing the CLI using Homebrew

1. To use Homebrew, visit the [official package installer website](https://brew.sh/) and follow the installation instructions located on its homepage. Then run the Install Command below:

| Package Manager | Website | Documentation | Install Command |
| ---------------------- | ------------ | -------- | ----------- |
| Homebrew | [Homebrew package manager](https://brew.sh/) | [Homebrew Support Documentation](https://docs.brew.sh/Manpage) | `brew install aziontech/tap/azioncli` |

2. Run the `azioncli --version` command to test the installation. The CLI displays its installed current version number on the terminal.

### Alternatives

Alternatively, you can [install Azion CLI manually](/en/documentation/products/guides/cli-installing-manually/).

If you're installing the CLI on a macOS operating system, see [running Azion CLI on macOS](/en/documentation/products/guides/cli-running-macos/).

---

## Authorization on the Azion Platform

To manage your settings, you must generate a *token* that identifies you on the Azion platform.

> For more information on how to create and manage your *tokens*, use the [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/#aab16606-2014-43d0-9b7a-dc564146a1ac) or see the [Personal Tokens](/en/documentation/products/accounts/personal-tokens/) documentation page.

Once you've created your personal token and have it on your clipboard you can locally store it by using the following command:

```bash
    $ azioncli configure --token <your_token>
```

All subsequent commands will use that same *token* and will consider all permissions granted to the account that *token* belongs to.

> You can replace your *Personal Token* at any time by repeating the command above.

## Commands

### Edge application 


#### Initializing

The initialization process creates the necessary environment for building your edge application. To do this, you must first:

- Choose one of the available types in the CLI:
  - Next.js
  - Static
  - CDN
- Initialize a **JavaScript** project with **Node.js** runtime environment.

#### Usage

```bash
    azioncli edge_applications init
```

#### Flags

##### Name

The `--name` option can be specified, but it isn't mandatory. If it isn't informed, the name of your project will be the same one that is in your `package.json` file.

##### Type

The `--type` option can be specified, but it isn't mandatory. If it isn't informed, the type of your project will be autodetected.

The CLI currently provides three templates and the type `cdn` for building edge applications that follow `--type`:

- Static

```bash
    azioncli edge_applications init --name <"application_name"> --type static
```

- Next.js

```bash
    azioncli edge_applications init --name <"application_name"> --type nextjs
```

- CDN

```bash
    azioncli edge_applications init --name <"application_name"> --type cdn
```

> **Note**: if there's no `package.json` configuration file in your edge application directory, the CLI will return the following error message:

```bash
    Error: Failed to find package.json in current directory. Verify if you are currently in your project's directory
```

In that case, create a `package.json` configuration file for your project in the same directory as your edge application. Then rerun the command in order to initialize the application.

> **Tip**: the best solution for creating a `package.json` file is to start a Node.js project in your edge application directory. To do so, use the command below from the Node.js runtime environment:
>
> `npm init -y`

Command response in terminal:

```bash
    Wrote to /Users/<user_name>/web-app-proj/package.json:

    {
    "name": "web-app-proj",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "",
    "main": "index.js",
    "scripts": {
        "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
    },
    "keywords": [],
    "author": "",
    "license": "ISC"
    }
```

##### No

The `--no` option forces a `no` response to all user inputs.

#### Yes

The `--yes` option forces a 'yes' response to all user inputs.

---

#### Building

The second step in creating an edge application is to build it based on the attributes provided in the `init` command. The command used to build the application is the `build` command.

##### Usage

```bash
    azioncli edge_applications build
```

##### Flags

##### Help

The only flag available for the `build` command is `--help`, which displays a brief help screen.

**Note**: a requirement for using the `build` command is the presence of the [webPack](https://webpack.js.org/) framework installed on your computer.

---

#### Publishing

The final step in creating an edge application is publishing it on the Azion platform. The `publish` command performs this task automatically.

##### Usage

```bash
    azioncli edge_applications publish
```

##### Flags

##### Help

The only flag available for the `publish` command is `--help`, which displays a brief help screen.

**Note**: publishing an edge application via **RTM** or CLI isn't an instantaneous process. There's a time to propagate and configure the application in Azion's edge locations. It may be necessary to wait a few minutes for the URL to be activated and the application page to be effectively displayed in the browser.

---
