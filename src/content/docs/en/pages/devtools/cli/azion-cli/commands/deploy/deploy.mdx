Deploy your edge application onto Azion's edge network through Azion CLI.

:::note 
In case one or more required fields aren't informed through the specific flags, an interactive message prompts and asks for the missing information.
:::

## Usage

```bash
azion deploy
```

## Optional flags

#### path 

The `--path` option is used when it's necessary to inform the filepath to the static application being deployed.

#### help

The `--help` option displays more information about the `deploy` command.

#### auto

The `--auto` option runs the entire flow of the command without interruptions.

#### config-dir

The `--config-dir` option specifies the relative path to where your custom `azion.json` and `args.json` files are stored. The default is "azion".

#### no-prompt

The `--no-prompt` option, when sent, ensures that whenever the CLI would display an interactive prompt due to an error, it instead just returns the error.

#### skip-build

The `--skip-build` option, when sent, prevents the build command from being called during the deploy process.

#### sync

The `--sync` option synchronizes the local `azion.json` file with remote resources.
