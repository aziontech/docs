## Link

The linking process adapts the project being linked to an Azion edge application.

:::note 
It's necessary to run the command in the project's root folder.
:::

### Usage

```sh
azion link
```

### Output 

Confirm the linking of the project to an Azion edge application:

```sh 
? Do you want to link /cli-examples/effervescent_moon to Azion? (y/N) 
```

Choose a *preset* and *mode*:

```sh 
? Choose a preset and mode:  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
> Html (Deliver)
  Javascript (Compute)
  Typescript (Compute)
  Angular (Deliver)
  Astro (Deliver)
  Hexo (Deliver)
  Next (Compute)
```

Now, the application will be linked to an edge application. Different processes occur based on the selected template, so you need to answer the interactions that are presented.

Choose if you want to run the application locally or not:

```sh
? Do you want to start a local development server? (y/N) 
```

:::note 
If you want to start a local development server later, run 'azion dev'
:::

```sh
? Do you want to deploy your project? No
```

:::note 
If you want to deploy your application later, run 'azion deploy'
:::

### Optional flags

#### auto

The `--auto` option can be informed, but it isn't mandatory. If informed, the entire flow of the command runs without interruptions.


#### name

The `--name` option can be specified, but it isn't mandatory. If it isn't informed, the name of your project will be autogenerated.

#### mode

The `--mode` option can be specified, but it isn't mandatory. The expected values are `deliver` and `compute`.

#### preset

The `--preset` option can be specified, but it isn't mandatory. The expected values are:

- Html
- Javascript
- Typescript
- Angular
- Astro
- Hexo
- Next 
- React
- Vue
- static

#### remote 

The `--remote` flag, followed by a link to a git repository, specifies the project to be cloned and linked to an edge application during the process.

#### package-manager

The `--package-manager` option allows you to specify the package manager to use. Example: `npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`. If not informed, the package manager will be set automatically based on `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`. If none of these files are found, then `npm` is default.

#### help

The `--help` option displays more information about the `link` command.
