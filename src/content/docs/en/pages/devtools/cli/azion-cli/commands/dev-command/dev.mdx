## dev

The `dev` command adapts the environment for building your application and run it locally. It's used for projects already initialized or linked to an **Azion Application**.

:::tip
If you want to run this command for a project that hasn't been initialized as an Azion Application, you can run the `link` command to link the project to Azion.
