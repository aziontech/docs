## Usage

```sh
azion init
```

## Optional flags

#### name

The `--name` option can be specified, but it isn't mandatory. If it isn't informed, the name of your project will be autogenerated.

#### help

The `--help` option displays more information about the `build` command.

:::note 
The init command disposes of an interactive journey. It'll ask if you want to initialize a local development server and deploy the project.
