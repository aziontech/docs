Initialize an edge application from a starter template. You can choose a template based on Next, Vue, React, Angular, Astro, and other frameworks.

:::note 
In case one or more required fields aren't informed through the specific flags, an interactive message prompts and asks for the missing information.

## Usage

```sh
azion init
```

## Optional flags

#### name

The `--name` option can be specified, but it isn't mandatory. If it isn't informed, the name of your project will be autogenerated.

#### package-manager

The `--package-manager` option allows you to specify the package manager to use. Example: `npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`. If not informed, the package manager will be set automatically based on `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`. If none of these files are found, then `npm` is default.

#### help

The `--help` option displays more information about the `build` command.

:::note 
The init command disposes of an interactive journey. It'll ask if you want to initialize a local development server and deploy the project.
