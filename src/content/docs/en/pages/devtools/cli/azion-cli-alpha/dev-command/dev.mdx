## dev

The `dev` command adapts the environment for building your edge application and run it locally. It's used for projects already initialized as **Azion edge applications**.

<Button href="/en/documentation/products/cli/link-command/" text="link an existing project to an Azion edge application" variant="secondary"> 
</Button>

:::note 
It's necessary to run the command in the project's root folder.

### Usage

azion dev
```

```sh

```
