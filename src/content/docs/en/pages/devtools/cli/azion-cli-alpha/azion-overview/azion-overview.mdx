**Azion CLI** is an [open  source](https://github.com/aziontech/azion-cli/) command-line interface (CLI) that lets you interact with Azion Edge Platform using a terminal. You can use Azion CLI to: 

- Initialize, build, and deploy edge applications.
- Create Jamstack applications.
- Manage the edge applications on the platform. 
- Have a local development server running. 
- Link an existing project to an Azion edge application.

Azion disposes of a set of options to interact with the Azion products, such as: 

- [Azion Terraform Provider](/en/documentation/products/terraform-provider/)
- [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/)
- [Azion SDK for Go](/en/documentation/devtools/sdk/go/)

The Azion CLI is built in Go and interacts with Azion products through the [Azion Go SDK](/en/documentation/devtools/sdk/go/).

## Updating Azion CLI

Every time a new version is released and any Azion command is used, a prompt informs the user about the new version and asks them if they wish to update it or not.

---

## Global options 

### version 

```sh 
azion --version
```

The `-v` or `--version` option informs which Azion version you've currently installed.

### debug 

```sh 
azion --debug
```

The `-d` or `--debug` option displays logs at a debug level.

### config 

```sh 
azion --config
```

The `-c` or `--config` option sets the Azion configuration folder for the current command only, without changing persistent settings.

### log-level 

```sh 
azion --log-level info
```

The `-l` or `--log-level` option informs the level of log to be output. The options are: 

- `info` (default)
- `error` 
- `debug`

### silent 

```sh 
azion --silent
```

The `-s` or `--silent` option silences logs completely. Usually, it's used for automation purposes.

```sh 
azion --token your-personal-token
```

The `-t` or `--token` option saves a given personal token locally to authorize CLI commands.

### yes 

```sh
