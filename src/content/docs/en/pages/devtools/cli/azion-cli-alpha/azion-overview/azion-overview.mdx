**Azion CLI** is an [open  source](https://github.com/aziontech/azion-cli/) command-line interface (CLI) that lets you interact with Azion Edge Platform using a terminal. You can use Azion CLI to: 

- Initialize, build, and deploy edge applications.
- Create Jamstack applications.
- Manage the edge applications on the platform. 
- Have a local development server running. 
- Link an existing project to an Azion edge application.

Azion disposes of a set of options to interact with the Azion products, such as: 

- [Azion Terraform Provider](/en/documentation/products/terraform-provider/)
- [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/)
- [Azion SDK for Go](/en/documentation/devtools/sdk/go/)

The Azion CLI is built in Go and interacts with Azion products through the [Azion Go SDK](/en/documentation/devtools/sdk/go/).

## Installing Azion CLI

### Downloading

If you choose the **RPM**, **Dpkg**, or **apk** package manager, or the **.deb** file, go to the [releases page](https://github.com/aziontech/azion-cli/releases) and download the desired package.

:::note 
If you choose to use Homebrew, the previous step isn't necessary.
:::

Choose one of the following options: 

import Tabs from '~/components/tabs/Tabs';

<Tabs client:visible sharedStore="package-managers">
<Fragment slot="tab.rpm">RPM</Fragment>
<Fragment slot="tab.dpkg">dpkg</Fragment>
<Fragment slot="tab.apk">APK</Fragment>

## Web frameworks

The CLI works together with an open-source framework adapter called [Vulcan](https://github.com/aziontech/vulcan). Vulcan adapts a variety of web frameworks to run on the edge of the network.

Azion employs the terminology `compute` and `deliver` to describe the operational modes of applications within its framework:

| Mode | Description |
| ----- | ------------ |
| Compute | Designed for applications that require computational processing at the Edge, whether it's for Front-End Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Back-End tasks. In Compute Mode, Azion enables the execution of code and processing of dynamic content at the Edge to enhance performance and responsiveness. | 
| Deliver | Tailored for frameworks that primarily focus on handling and routing incoming requests at the Edge, with an emphasis on efficiently serving static files. While applications in Deliver Mode don't execute dynamic code, they excel in optimizing the delivery of static content to end-users, thereby ensuring smooth and fast content distribution. |

The supported frameworks that run **static** (deliver) applications include:

- [Angular](/en/documentation/products/cli/frameworks/angular/)
- [Astro](/en/documentation/products/cli/frameworks/astro/)
- [Hexo](/en/documentation/products/cli/frameworks/hexo/)
- [Next.js](/en/documentation/products/cli/frameworks/next/)
- [React](/en/documentation/products/cli/frameworks/react/)
- [Vite](/en/documentation/products/cli/frameworks/vite/)
- [Vue](/en/documentation/products/cli/frameworks/vue/)

For applications that require processing on the edge (compute) rather than only delivery of content, it's supported:

- Next.js *version 12.3.1*, using the node runtime.

### version 

```sh 
azion --version
```

The `-v` or `--version` option informs which Azion version you've currently installed.
