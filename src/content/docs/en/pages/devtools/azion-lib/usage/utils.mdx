## Usage

### mountSPA

The `mountSPA` function is designed to process requests to a Single Page Application (SPA) that's being computed at the edge of a Content Delivery Network (CDN). It determines whether the incoming request is for a static asset or an application route and then mounts the appropriate request URL for fetching the required resource.

Example:

```typescript
import { mountSPA } from 'azion/utils';

const myApp: Response = await mountSPA('https://example.com/');
console.log(myApp);
// Fetches: file:///index.html
// Response object representing the content of index.html
```

### mountMPA

The `mountMPA` function handles requests for Multi-Page Applications (MPA) at the edge. It processes the incoming request URL, constructs the appropriate asset path, and fetches the corresponding response from the origin server or edge cache.

**TypeScript example:**

```typescript
import { mountMPA } from 'azion/utils';

const myApp: Response = await mountMPA('https://example.com/about');
console.log(myApp);
// Fetches: file:///about/index.html
// Response object representing the content of about/index.html
```

### parseRequest

The `parseRequest` function is designed to parse and log the details of an incoming request. It extracts key information such as headers, cookies, body, and client data from the incoming `fetchEvent, providing a structured object with all these details for further processing or logging.

**TypeScript example:**

```typescript
import { parseRequest } from 'azion/utils';
import type { ParsedRequest } from 'azion/utils';

const parsedRequest: ParsedRequest = await parseRequest(event);
console.log(parsedRequest);
```
