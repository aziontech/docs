The **Azion Libraries** provide a suite of tools to interact with various Azion services, including **Purge**, **Object Storage**, and **Image Processor**. Each library is configurable and supports debug mode and environment variable-based configuration.

These libraries are designed to be versatile and can be used both within and outside of the [Azion Runtime](/en/documentation/runtime/overview/) environment. When used outside of the Azion Runtime, the libraries will interact with Azion services via REST APIs. However, when used within the Azion Runtime, the libraries will leverage internal runtime capabilities for enhanced performance and efficiency.
