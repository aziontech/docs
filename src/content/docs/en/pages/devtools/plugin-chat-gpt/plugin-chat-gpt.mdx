## Usage

Once you've installed the **Azion Plugin ChatGPT** on your account, the plugin's usage works by sending prompts and requesting actions to the AI. You can use it as you'd normally would use ChatGPT, only requesting specific Azion-related prompts.

You can, for example:

- List existing instances
- Update instances
- Chnage instance's names
- Delete instances
