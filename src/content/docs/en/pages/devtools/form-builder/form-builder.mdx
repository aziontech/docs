## Overview

Form Builder is a declarative compiler for efficiently building form-based web user interfaces (UIs). These UIs are targeted at entering, modifying, and viewing data and are typically embedded within [Functions](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/functions/) used in [Applications](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/) and [Firewalls](/en/documentation/products/secure/firewall/).

---

## How it works

Form Builder is built on top of [JsonForms](https://jsonforms.io/docs/) and uses a schema-driven approach: the UI is generated from JSON Schemas.

- **Data/JSON Schema**: Defines the underlying data structure to be displayed in the UI, including objects, properties, and their types.

### Example schema

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": { "type": "string" },
    "description": { "type": "string" },
    "done": { "type": "boolean" },
    "rating": { "type": "integer" }
  },
  "required": ["name"]
}
```

---

## Why use Form Builder

- Visual interface for Azion Functions arguments through a form-based mode.
- User-friendly for non-technical users who need to edit argument values.
- Flexible management to add, edit, or remove visual form elements as needed.
- Automatic rendering based on the JSON Schema configuration.

---

## Getting started

### Create a Function with Form Builder

1. Go to [**Functions**](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/functions/) â†’ **+ Function**.
2. Open the **Arguments** tab and select the **JSON/Form Builder** options.
3. Click **+ Form Builder** to load an example configuration and see how the visual form is generated.

### Use Function Instances with Form Builder

Application and Firewall [Functions Instances](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/functions-instances/) render using the configured Form Builder from the created function.

When a Form Builder is configured during function creation/editing, the visual form loads with a `Form/JSON` selector panel when loading instances in [Applications](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/) or Firewalls.

- Fill function arguments by entering values in the input fields.

:::note
When Form Builder is configured, manual JSON argument editing is disabled.
:::

---

## Editing Form Builder schema

You can modify the form schema directly:

1. Below the form, select the option to edit the schema to add or adjust inputs.
2. Switch back to the visual form to render the updated schema.

:::note
Editing the schema in production environments isnâ€™t recommended. Use this for experimentation and prototyping.

## Advanced example

The following example demonstrates a variety of configuration possibilities. It includes validation constraints, defaults, patterns, and arrays of objects.

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "checkboxInput": {
      "type": "boolean",
      "title": "Boolean",
      "description": "Name of the cookie used to store the A/B test variation"
    },
    "cookie_name": {
      "type": "string",
      "title": "Cookie Name",
      "description": "Name of the cookie used to store the A/B test variation",
      "minLength": 1,
      "maxLength": 64,
      "pattern": "^[a-zA-Z0-9_+-]+$"
    },
    "domain": {
      "type": "string",
      "title": "Domain",
      "description": "Domain where the cookie will be valid (use '.' at the beginning for subdomains)",
      "default": ".azion.com",
      "pattern": "^[.]?[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9-]*[a-zA-Z0-9]*\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$"
    },
    "max_age": {
      "type": "integer",
      "title": "Max Age (seconds)",
      "description": "Lifetime of the cookie in seconds",
      "default": 180,
      "minimum": 1,
      "maximum": 31536000
    },
    "path": {
      "type": "string",
      "title": "Path",
      "description": "Path where the cookie will be valid"
    },
    "values": {
      "type": "array",
      "title": "Test Variations",
      "description": "List of A/B test variations with their respective weights",
      "minItems": 2,
      "maxItems": 10,
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "value": {
            "type": "string",
            "title": "Variation Value",
            "description": "Unique identifier of the variation",
            "minLength": 1,
            "maxLength": 50,
            "pattern": "^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$"
          },
          "weight": {
            "type": "integer",
            "title": "Weight",
            "description": "Variation weight (higher weight = higher probability)",
            "minimum": 1,
            "maximum": 100
          }
        },
        "required": ["value", "weight"]
      }
    }
  },
  "required": ["cookie_name", "domain", "max_age", "values"]
}
```

### Supported schema properties

The following JSON Schema properties are supported:

- `type`: Data type specification
- `title`: Display label for the field
- `description`: Help text for the field
- `default`: Default value
- `minimum` / `maximum`: Numeric constraints
- `minLength` / `maxLength`: String length constraints
- `minItems` / `maxItems`: Number of min/max items
- `pattern`: Regular expression validation
- `required`: Required field specifications

---

### Future considerations

- Custom renderers for specialized form elements.
- Complete input type coverage.
- Enhanced components:
  - Advanced select components
  - Rich text inputs
  - Custom checkbox styles
  - Specialized input blocks
- Dynamic response-based selection: select options based on API responses.

---

## Best practices

1. Keep schemas simple and well-structured for better user experience.
2. Use validation constraints (min/max, patterns) to ensure data integrity.
3. Provide clear titles and descriptions for all fields.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues

- Form not rendering: verify JSON Schema syntax and structure.
- Validation errors: check that required fields are properly defined.
- Display issues: ensure field types are supported (see the compatibility table).
