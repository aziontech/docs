The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard developed by Anthropic that enables AI assistants to securely connect to data sources and tools. Azion's MCP server allows code assistants like Claude, Cursor, and Windsurf to access Azion Platform capabilities directly, providing intelligent assistance for your development workflow.

---

## How it works

MCP acts as a standardized interface between AI assistants and external services. When you configure your code assistant with Azion's MCP server:

1. The assistant connects to the MCP server using your Personal Token
2. The server exposes Azion's documentation, tools, and capabilities
3. You interact with the assistant using natural language
4. The assistant uses MCP tools to search documentation, generate configurations, and provide deployment guides
