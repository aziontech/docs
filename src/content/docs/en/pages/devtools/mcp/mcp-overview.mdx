The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard developed by Anthropic that enables AI assistants to securely connect to data sources and tools. Azion's MCP server allows code assistants like Claude, Cursor, and Windsurf to access Azion Platform capabilities directly, providing intelligent assistance for your development workflow.

---

## How it works

MCP acts as a standardized interface between AI assistants and external services. When you configure your code assistant with Azion's MCP server:

1. The assistant connects to the MCP server using your Personal Token
2. The server exposes Azion's documentation, tools, and capabilities
3. You interact with the assistant using natural language
4. The assistant uses MCP tools to search documentation, generate configurations, and provide deployment guides

## API endpoint

The Azion MCP server is available at:

**Production URL**: `https://mcp.azion.com`

---

## Capabilities

The Azion MCP server provides nine specialized tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `search_azion_docs_and_site` | Search Azion Platform documentation and features |
| `search_azion_code_samples` | Retrieve code libraries and implementation examples |
| `search_azion_cli_commands` | Get Azion CLI commands and usage information |
| `search_azion_api_v3_commands` | Access API v3 documentation (legacy) |
| `search_azion_api_v4_commands` | Access API v4 documentation (current) |
| `search_azion_terraform` | Search Terraform provider documentation |
| `create_rules_engine` | Generate Rules Engine configurations |
| `create_graphql_query` | Build GraphQL queries for analytics |
| `deploy_azion_static_site` | Get guides for deploying static sites |

## Requirements

- **Azion Personal Token**: Create one at [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com/personal-tokens)
- **MCP-compatible code assistant**: Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, or VS Code
- **Node.js 18+** (for some configurations using `mcp-remote`)
