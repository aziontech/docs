Azion Plans is one of the available methods for contracting Azion Products and Services, subject to the terms of the [Customer Agreement](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/agreements/customer-agreement/) and other related documents. Under this model, the Customer acquires a set of Products and Services with distinct features and limits, according to the selection made at the time of purchase.

**1. Subscription Format**

1.1. The Products and Services provided as part of Azion Plans are subscription-based, for the period specified during the initial sign-up process or at first use—monthly or annually (“Subscription Period”).

1.2. All Azion Plan subscriptions will automatically renew for periods equal in length to the initial Subscription Period, and charges will be made according to current rates, unless the subscription is canceled by the Customer via Azion Console prior to the next scheduled billing date.

1.3. The features and usage volumes included in each plan are described on Azion Website, and such description is incorporated into these Terms for all legal purposes.

**2. Free Plan**

2.1. Azion may offer a free plan (“Free Plan”) intended for personal, experimental, or non-commercial use, unless expressly authorized otherwise. The Free Plan will be available at no cost until any of the following occur: (a) the Customer subscribes to a paid plan (“Paid Plan”); (b) the Customer begins using Products and Services under the On Demand model; or (c) the Free Plan is discontinued by Azion. The purchase of paid Products and Services (“Paid Add-ons”) does not, by itself, revoke the Customer’s status under the Free Plan.

2.2. Azion may, at its sole discretion, modify, suspend, or terminate the Free Plan, as well as disable the Customer’s account, workspaces, workloads, or related resources, with or without prior notice. Azion is not liable for any loss or damage resulting from the use of the Free Plan, including suspension or deletion of data.

**3. Pricing and Payment**

3.1. The Paid Plan is billed on a recurring and prepaid basis to the credit card or other valid payment method registered by the Customer (“Payment Method”), until it is canceled. Any Payment Method provided must be valid and kept up to date by the Customer throughout the Subscription Period. By providing a Payment Method to Azion, the Customer represents and warrants that they are authorized to use it.

3.2. To access Paid Add-ons, the Customer authorizes Azion to charge the Payment Method monthly, annually, on demand, or as applicable, for the amount associated with the contracted Paid Add-ons. Charges will begin on the Paid Add-on subscription date, regardless of usage or whether it is fully configured. For usage-based Paid Add-ons, Azion may perform a pre-authorization hold on the Payment Method at any time during the billing cycle, which will be automatically removed upon expiration.

**4. Plan Changes**

4.1. The Customer may voluntarily switch to a different plan at any time, with a pro-rated charge according to the migration date.

     4.1.1. Upgrade: takes effect immediately, and the prorated amount already paid is converted into credit on the new plan.
    
     4.1.2. Downgrade: becomes effective in the next billing cycle.

**5. Cancellation and Termination**

5.1. The Customer may cancel automatic renewal of the Azion Plan at any time. After cancellation, the Customer will continue to have access to the Products and Services included in the Paid Plan until the end of the Subscription Period, with no right to any refund.

5.2. If either party materially breaches these Terms, the non-breaching party may terminate at any time.

5.3. Azion may, at its sole discretion, terminate any offered plans, with or without notice, for any reason. For Paid Plans, Customer access and configurations will remain available until the end of the Subscription Period.

**6. Price Changes**

6.1. The price of each Azion Plan may be changed at any time, at Azion’s discretion, and new prices will take effect from the next Subscription Period.

**7. Updates to These Terms**

7.1. Azion may modify these Terms or the characteristics of Azion Plans by publishing a revised version on Azion Website, with or without prior notice. Continued use implies acceptance of the new terms.

**8. General Provisions**

8.1. AZION RESERVES THE RIGHT TO MONITOR, AT ANY TIME, THE CUSTOMER’S CONSUMPTION UNDER THE SELECTED PLAN AND MAY, AT ITS SOLE DISCRETION, LIMIT, SUSPEND, OR DISABLE ACCESS TO AND/OR USAGE OF ANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, IF IT IDENTIFIES OR HAS REASONABLE INDICATIONS THAT THE CUSTOMER’S USAGE IS NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE LIMITS, PURPOSES, OR CONDITIONS ESTABLISHED FOR THE SELECTED PLAN. THIS MEASURE MAY BE TAKEN WITH OR WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE, ESPECIALLY IN CASES WHERE SUCH USAGE COULD AFFECT THE STABILITY, SECURITY, OR PERFORMANCE OF THE AZION PLATFORM OR OTHER CUSTOMERS.

8.2. The Customer may not assign or transfer their Azion Plan, or any of their rights hereunder, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without Azion’s prior written consent.

8.3. The failure to exercise the right to enforce any provision of these Terms shall not affect Azion’s right to enforce such provision at any time, nor shall any waiver of any breach or default under these Terms or any provision of this Agreement be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach or default, or a waiver of the provision itself.

8.4. If any part of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable portion will be enforced to the maximum extent permitted, and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.
