The **Savings Plan** is one of the ways to contract Products and Services from Azion, subject to the terms of the [Customer Agreement](/en/documentation/agreements/customer-agreement/) and other linked documents. In this format, the Customer commits to pay a financial amount during the Term of Validity (the "Purchase Commitment") and can enjoy discounts on the On Demand Price published on the date of signing, according to their Service Order ("Discount on the On Demand Price"), except for third-party products listed in the Azion Marketplace.

Azion will apply the Discount on the On Demand Price according to its discount table. This discount cannot be accumulated with any others (including those available on the Azion website). Azion will apply the discount during the Term of Validity, provided that the Customer is complying with the Customer Agreement and any other terms and agreements established between the parties.

## 1. Consumption Assessment and Payment

1.1. The consumption assessment will occur monthly, and billing will be calculated based on the On Demand Prices, applying discounts, if any, from the highest percentage to the lowest.

1.2. The amounts paid in the Purchase Commitment may only be used in the respective month and cannot be used in subsequent months.

1.3 The rationale between the Purchase Commitment and the Discount on the On Demand Price may be adjusted annually according to the monetary correction indices indicated in the Customer Agreement, ensuring the same volume of consumption available to the Customer.

1.4. The Customer may, until the halfway point of the contracted Term of Validity, add amounts to their account with Azion for use in Products and Services, complementing the amounts of the Purchase Commitment ("Supplementary Credits"), with the same discount percentages indicated in the Service Order, without altering the Purchase Commitment.

## 2. Renewal and Termination

2.1. The Service Order will be automatically renewed for equal periods at the end of the Term of Validity, successively, unless one of the Parties opposes the automatic renewal, notifying the other at least 30 (thirty) days in advance of the end of the Term of Validity, according to Clause 3 of the Customer Agreement.

2.2. Each party may terminate the Service Order for cause by written notice if the other party is in material breach of its contractual obligations, provided that the breaching party has 30 (thirty) days from receipt of the notice to remedy any material breach that can be remedied.

2.3. In the event of cancellation and early termination of the Service Order without cause at the Customer's initiative, Azion shall be entitled to receive all overdue installments and also the amounts due from the Purchase Commitment, according to the Service Order, until the end of the Term of Validity.

## 3. Other Terms

3.1. In the event of non-compliance with any clause of the Customer Agreement, as well as any other contract or term agreed upon between the parties, including the Service Order, the Customer shall be subject to the disregard of the Discount on the On Demand Price and retroactive billing from the beginning of the Term of Validity of the amounts recalculated as On Demand consumption.

3.2. The Customer is aware and agrees that the Products and Services will be subject to the On Demand Prices, billed monthly, when: (a) their consumption exceeds the Purchase Commitment and any credits acquired or received; (b) using Products and Services not eligible for the Discount on the On Demand Price or that are not specified in the Service Order; or (c) after the Term of Validity, there is no automatic renewal or signing of a new Service Order.

3.3. In the event of a conflict or divergence between the conditions defined herein and in the Service Order, the provisions of the Service Order shall prevail.
