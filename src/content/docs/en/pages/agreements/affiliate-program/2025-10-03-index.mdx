These Azion Affiliate Program Terms (“Terms”) apply to Affiliate’s participation in any Azion Affiliate Program (“Program”), including the Ambassador Program. Any person or entity (“Affiliate”) who participates or attempts to participate in a Program must accept these Terms. These Terms incorporate, and Affiliate agrees to comply with, the most current version of all policies, guidelines, and other rules referenced in these Terms and any other policies that apply to the tools, content, and resources made available to Affiliate under the Program (“Program Guidelines”). If Affiliate enrolls in a Program on behalf of an entity or organization, Affiliate binds that organization to these Terms and represents that they have the authority to do so.

**1. Eligibility**

Acceptance into a Program is at Azion's sole discretion. Azion may reject or deny an Affiliate's application for any reason. To be eligible to participate in the Program, an Affiliate must: (a) be the age of majority in their jurisdiction of residence; and (b) maintain an account with Azion (and the applicable Program platform) in good standing at the time of payment. Any information collected through Azion's application or registration process will be maintained pursuant to [Azion's Privacy Policy](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/agreements/privacy-policy/). Upon acceptance into a Program, Affiliate will be a “Participant” in that Program and may be entitled to receive compensation for creating, sharing, or distributing content about Azion, as set forth in these Terms and the Program Guidelines.

1.1. **Program Compliance Requirements**. An Affiliate must comply with these Terms to participate in a Program and receive any Commissions (as defined below). Azion may monitor the Affiliate's website or marketing channels at any time to determine whether the Affiliate is complying with these Terms and the Program Guidelines.

1.2. **Violations.** If the Affiliate violates these Terms, the Program Guidelines, or any other applicable terms and conditions, in addition to any other rights or remedies available to Azion, Azion reserves the right to permanently (in accordance with applicable law) cease payment of all Commissions that would otherwise be due to the Affiliate under these Terms, whether or not directly related to such violation, without prior notice and without prejudice to any right to recover damages beyond that amount. If the Affiliate's Azion account was deactivated prior to payment, the Affiliate will not be entitled to receive Commissions.

**2. Commissions and Payments**

If any Commission payments are provided for by the Program in which the Affiliate participates, the following terms apply:

2.1. **Commission Payment.** Eligible participants will receive compensation (“Commissions”) as set forth in the applicable Program Guidelines. Commissions may consist of commissions for qualifying purchases completed through an Affiliate Link or credits for use of Azion products and services (“Products and Services”). All Commissions earned are a one-time payment, unless otherwise expressly stated in the Program Guidelines. To receive payment under the Program, the Affiliate must: (a) have agreed to these Terms and the terms of Azion’s third-party payment processors or program administrators; (b) have completed all necessary steps to create their account; (c) have provided a valid and current payment method in that account; and (d) have completed any tax documentation that may be required for Azion or the third-party program administrator to process any payments due to the Affiliate. Azion reserves the right to withhold or deduct Commissions earned through the Program if Azion determines or believes that receipt of the Commission was in error, fraudulent, unlawful, or in violation of these Terms or any other applicable agreement between the Affiliate and Azion.

2.2. **Maximum Commission.** Azion reserves the right to establish a maximum amount of Commissions that an Affiliate may earn as a Participant. It is the Affiliate's obligation to consult the Program Guidelines for the current maximum limits. Furthermore, if the Affiliate has received the Maximum Commission, Azion, at its sole discretion, may automatically terminate the Affiliate's eligibility to participate in a Program. The Affiliate may not create multiple Azion accounts to circumvent the Maximum Commission, and Azion may withhold or deny any amounts above the Maximum Commission.

2.3. **Taxes.** The Affiliate shall be responsible for paying all taxes imposed by any governmental authority on the payment of Commissions, if any. If Azion is required to withhold any taxes or similar amounts, Azion will do so and make such payments. Any withholding taxes paid by Azion to the tax authority will be deducted from the amount due to the Affiliate, so that the amount paid to the Affiliate will be net of any withholding taxes. Upon the Affiliate's request, Azion will provide a copy of the receipt or certificate for the withholding tax paid.

2.4. **Affiliate Links**. If the Affiliate has access to a link to Azion Products and Services associated with the Affiliate as a Participant (“Affiliate Link”), the following additional terms apply:

      2.4.1. When a customer clicks on an Affiliate Link to purchase a subscription to a particular Azion product or service, the Affiliate may receive commission income from qualifying purchases as described (and subject to limitations) in the Program Guidelines. If Azion requests that the Affiliate remove an Affiliate Link from its properties, the Affiliate must comply with such request within twenty-four (24) hours. Failure to comply may result in the suspension or termination of the Affiliate's participation in the Program and/or forfeiture of payments, as determined by Azion in its sole discretion.

      2.4.2. The Affiliate will only be eligible for Commission payments for customer transactions that are completed: (a) through the Affiliate Link made available by Azion to the Affiliate; (b) through Azion's self-service checkout process; and (c) on customer transactions designated as eligible for compensation by the Program Guidelines, regardless of any additional or subsequent purchases made by the same customer of the Products and Services or the Azion platform. The Affiliate is not eligible for Commission payments if: (i) a potential customer does not complete the purchase or registration for the Products and Services after clicking the Affiliate Link, even if the customer subsequently purchases a subscription directly by visiting the Azion website or through another link; (ii) a customer enters the purchase flow through the Affiliate's Affiliate Link but completes the purchase through an Azion Account Executive or other sales-assisted process; (iii) the Affiliate Link is used after the termination or expiration of the Affiliate's participation in the Program; or (iv) at the time of or prior to use of the Affiliate Link, such customer is already a pre-existing Azion customer or is actively engaged in a sales process with Azion. Azion will not be responsible for any errors by the Affiliate or customers in using the Affiliate Link, even if such errors result in reduction of amounts that would otherwise be paid to the Affiliate under these Terms. Only a singleParticipantYou may receive a commission for a referred client. In the event that multiple people claim credit for a specific referral, Azion will have full discretion to determine who earned the referral in accordance with Azion's systems.

      2.4.3. The Affiliate acknowledges and agrees that the Azion Affiliate Link program is administered by Dub Technologies, Inc. (“Dub”) and that Azion pays Commissions related to the Affiliate’s Affiliate Link using one of the payment methods supported by the Dub platform. The Affiliate represents and warrants that he or she has carefully read, understood, and accepted the terms and conditions of the Dub platform available on the Dub website (“Dub Terms and Conditions”) and acknowledges that acceptance is a precondition for receiving Commissions in connection with the Affiliate Link. In the event of a conflict between these Terms or any Program Guidelines and the Dub Terms and Conditions, these Terms and the Program Guidelines shall prevail.
