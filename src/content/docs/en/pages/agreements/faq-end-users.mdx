This FAQ explains how Azion handles personal data of the end users of our corporate customers—meaning individuals who access digital platforms powered by Azion’s infrastructure. We act as a data processor, supporting our customers (the data controllers) to ensure compliance with privacy laws such as LGPD, GDPR, CCPA, and CPRA.

**1\. Does Azion collect my personal data directly?**  
No. Azion does not collect data directly from end users. Data is processed exclusively according to our customers’ instructions, who act as data controllers.

**2\. What types of data does Azion process on behalf of its customers?**  
Azion processes technical data such as IP addresses, access information, browsing data, and logs. This data is handled following customer configurations and is necessary to ensure the security, stability, and performance of the services you use.

**3\. Does Azion process sensitive data of end users?**  
Not directly. When customers store and process sensitive data on our infrastructure, Azion applies advanced security measures, but control and directions on this processing remain with the customer.

**4\. Does Azion protect my personal data?**  
Yes. We use end-to-end encryption, multi-factor authentication, environment segregation, and continuous monitoring to protect data against unauthorized access.

**5\. Can I request access, correction, or deletion of my personal data from Azion?**  
Not directly. As a processor, Azion follows the instructions of the data controllers. We recommend that you contact the data controller, that is, the company you interact with,  to exercise your data subject rights.

**6\. Does Azion transfer my data outside my country?**  
Azion’s infrastructure is globally distributed. Data may be processed outside your country but only as permitted by law and through mechanisms such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs).

**7\. Does Azion share my data with third parties?**  
No. Azion does not share or sell end user personal data. All data processing strictly follows contracts with our customers and only as per their instructions.

**8\. Does Azion comply with international privacy laws such as LGPD, GDPR, and CPRA?**  
Yes. Azion is in an advanced compliance stage and adopts controls to support adherence to these regulations, helping customers safeguard their users’ rights.

**9\. Do privacy settings I make on a site using Azion take effect immediately?**  
These configurations are managed by the data controller, meaning our customers, who maintain control over these mechanisms. It's important to note that data such as cookies and request body content are not stored on our platform. Additionally, if your inquiry relates to accessing Azion services, such as the Console or our website, the configurations apply according to the policies of those environments. 

Azion provides technical support to help customers implement consent mechanisms, cookie blocking, and other similar functionalities. 

Currently, there is no automated opt-out mechanism on the platform, but customers can request unsubscription via email by contacting privacy@azion.com.

**10\. How can I clarify questions about my data processed by Azion?**  
We recommend contacting the company that collected your data (the controller) directly.
