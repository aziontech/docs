Privacy and data protection are fundamental matters for **AZION**. Therefore, reinforcing our commitment to this subject, this **PRIVACY POLICY** (or simply "Policy") governs the manner in which Azion collects, uses, stores, and discloses information collected from users (individually, "User") across all content in connection with activities, Products and Services, functions, or features that we provide to Customers and their End Users ("Content"), in addition to referencing the security measures and practices adopted by the company to safeguard and uphold your rights provided under applicable legislation.

## **Personal data processed and collection methods** 

Azion may collect your personal data, such as name, residential address, email, phone number, or any other information from Azion website visitors, which, when used alone or with other data, may individually identify a visitor to Azion's website. Data may be collected in the following ways: (a) if you provide it through platform registration, subscription to our products and services, newsletter subscription, survey responses, form completion, (b) subscription to our products and services, or (c) through automatic cookie collection. 

## **Use of personal data and processing purposes** 

Personal data processing may serve the following purposes:

* Improve our Products and Services;  
* Enhance Content;  
* Conduct promotions, contests, surveys, or other Content features;  
* Send periodic emails to respond to your questions, inquiries, or other requests;  
* Offer more targeted services and advertisements, making your visit to Azion's website more productive;  
* Keep Products secure and protected;  
* Make suggestions for you and other users to improve and personalize your experience;  
* Internal operations, including error correction, data analysis, testing, research, development, and service improvement.

All these operations will always be based on authorized legal grounds, including but not limited to contract execution and preliminary procedures, compliance with legal obligations, regular exercise of rights in processes or contracts, credit protection, serving Azion's or third parties' legitimate interests, and fraud prevention. In other cases, personal data processing will be conditional upon the data subject's consent.

If you no longer wish to receive marketing communications from Azion, you may unsubscribe directly through the unsubscribe link included in emails or by contacting [privacy@azion.com](mailto:privacidade@azion.com).

## **Data sharing** 

Azion does not share, sell, or disclose your personal information except as described in this Policy. Your data, however, may be disclosed (i) if the company is required to do so by law, regulation, or legal process — for example, a court order or subpoena; (ii) in response to requests from government agencies, such as law enforcement authorities; (iii) with your express authorization; (iv) after prior notification to you; and (v) through pseudonymization of records, circumstances in which it will not be possible to personally identify you.

## **Data retention periods** 

Azion will maintain data for as long as users and visitors maintain a relationship with the company. After termination of this relationship, Azion may continue to maintain data due to legal obligations or the company's legitimate interest, to help respond to legal demands and/or audits and for other causes, such as combating fraud and responding to regulatory agency requests.

## **Data subject rights** 

Azion guarantees each data subject the full exercise of rights provided under the applicable laws and regulations applicable to data protection and privacy. This includes: confirming the existence of personal data processing; accessing one's own data; correcting incomplete, inaccurate, or outdated information; requesting anonymization, blocking, or elimination of unnecessary, excessive, or improperly processed data; requesting data portability upon express request; requesting deletion of data processed based on consent, respecting legal retention periods; obtaining information about public or private entities with which Azion shared data; being informed about the possibility of refusing consent and respective consequences; revoking consent at any time, under the applicable laws and regulations applicable to data protection and privacy; and requesting review of decisions made solely based on automated processing that affect their interests, including decisions intended to define personal, professional, consumer, or credit profiles, or personality aspects.

To exercise any of these rights, send your request to [dpo@azion.com](mailto:dpo@azion.com) ("Rights Request"). Before fulfilling the request, we may request additional information to verify that the requesting person is indeed the data subject in question, thus ensuring information security and confidentiality.

If you are submitting a Rights Request on behalf of another person as an authorized agent, we require that: (a) the data subject verify their identity and confirm directly with Azion that they granted permission to the authorized agent to submit the Rights Request; (b) the authorized agent possess a power of attorney granted by the data subject, in accordance with the legislation of the data subject's jurisdiction; or (c) the Rights Request be submitted in another manner in compliance with applicable privacy legislation.

## **Personal data security** 

Azion employs technical and administrative measures, with the security standard usually adopted by the market for personal data protection, suitable to protect users' and visitors' personal data against unauthorized access and against accidental or unlawful situations of destruction, loss, alteration, communication, or dissemination.

Likewise, personal information of customers, users, and visitors is restricted access only to employees or parties who need the data for execution and performance of their duties.

## **Privacy Policy updates** 

Azion may periodically modify the terms of this Privacy Policy at any time, publishing a revised version on Azion's website. Modified documents will take effect immediately upon publication.

## **Change in control** 

If Azion's ownership is acquired by third parties, we may transfer your information to the new owner so they can continue operating Azion's website, remaining obligated, however, to honor the commitments we made in this Privacy Policy.

## **International data transfer** 

Your data may be processed on servers located outside Brazil, in countries where Azion or its providers maintain infrastructure. In these situations, we apply adequate safeguards — including standard contractual clauses, encryption, and access controls — to ensure a level of protection equivalent to that required by applicable regulations.
