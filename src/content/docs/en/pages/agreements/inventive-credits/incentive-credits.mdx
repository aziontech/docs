These Terms and Conditions of Incentive Credits govern the use of any Azion Incentive Credits (“Incentive Credits”) and are subject to the Customer Agreement (the “Agreement”), available at [https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/agreements/](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/agreements/).

1. **Incentive Credits**

   1.1. Azion may encourage Customers to adopt its Products and Services by granting Incentive Credits. These credits are intended to reduce the adoption costs for the Customer and are issued through Incentive Credit Notes (“Incentive Credit Note”), which may be redeemed under the terms specified in the respective note. Incentive Credits are promotional credits provided by Azion that may be applied to offset future charges for the use of Azion Products and Services, as set forth in these Terms and Conditions and the applicable Incentive Credit Note.

   1.2. Incentive Credits may only be used by Eligible Accounts, for the purpose and Validity indicated in the Incentive Credit Note, and are granted on a one-time basis, not renewed in case of renewal of a Service Order.

   1.3. Incentive Credits may be used from the Redemption Date and will result in automatic deductions from the amounts owed by the Customer, limited to the terms of the Incentive Credit Note.

   1.4. Any charges related to the use of any Products and Services that exceed the amount of available Incentive Credits will be invoiced as defined in the Customer Agreement or in the documents linked thereto.

   1.5 Failure to use Incentive Credits by the end of their Validity will result in forfeiture. No refund will be granted for expired or canceled Incentive Credits.

2. **Conditions**

   2.1. The Customer may not sell, license, lease, or otherwise transfer the Incentive Credits. Incentive Credits have no intrinsic value, cannot be redeemed for cash, and are non-refundable, constituting merely a means of acknowledging and encouraging the use of Azion Products and Services. Incentive Credits cannot be purchased for money, and Azion and its affiliates do not commercialize Incentive Credits.

   2.2. Incentive Credits will be void in the event of fraudulent use or non-compliance with any terms of the Agreement or these Terms and Conditions. This includes, but is not limited to, creating multiple accounts to obtain additional Incentive Credits, manipulating Azion’s processes or systems, or any other action intended to gain undue advantage. Regardless of any other legal measures available to Azion, the Customer shall reimburse Azion for any Incentive Credits used in violation of these terms.

   2.3. By redeeming Incentive Credits, the Customer represents and warrants that the receipt and use of the Incentive Credits are not prohibited or inconsistent with any applicable laws, regulations, or binding orders (including applicable ethical or contractual rules), and will not create any conflict of interest for the Customer’s contracting entity with Azion.

   2.4. Incentive Credits may not be used to offset invoices issued prior to the Redemption Date.

   2.5. If the Customer is a government entity or any other entity subject to regulations or internal policies that restrict the receipt of financial incentives, discounts, or Incentive Credits, the Customer must ensure compliance with such restrictions before using or accepting Incentive Credits. Any use or acceptance of Incentive Credits in violation of applicable regulations or policies shall be deemed null and void.

   2.6. The Customer may not publish any press release or make any other public disclosure related to Incentive Credits without Azion’s prior written consent. In addition, the Customer agrees not to make any misleading statements or misrepresent the relationship between Azion and the Customer.

   2.7. The Customer agrees not to suggest that Azion supports, sponsors, or endorses the Customer unless the Customer has prior written authorization from Azion to do so.

   2.8. Azion reserves the right to, upon reasonable prior notice, audit the Customer’s use of Incentive Credits to verify compliance with these Terms and Conditions. The Customer agrees to fully cooperate with any audit and provide access to all necessary information and documentation.

   2.9. In no event shall Azion be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or related to the use or inability to use the Incentive Credits.

   2.10. In the event of any conflict among the terms and documents related to the contracting, the order of precedence shall be as follows, solely with respect to the use of Incentive Credits: (i) Incentive Credit Note; (ii) Service Order; (iii) Terms and Conditions of Incentive Credits; and (iv) other provisions of the Agreement or other linked documents.
