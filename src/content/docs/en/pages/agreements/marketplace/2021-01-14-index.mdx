These Terms and Conditions for Azion Marketplace Sellers (this "Agreement") govern your listing or offer of Your Marketplace Content in Azion Marketplace and are an agreement between Azion Technologies LLC ("Azion," "we," "us," or "our") and you or the entity you represent ("you" or "your"). This Agreement takes effect when you click an “I Accept” button or check box presented with these terms or, if earlier, when you use any of the Service Offerings (the "Effective Date"). You represent to us that you are lawfully able to enter into contracts (e.g., you are not a minor). If you are entering into this Agreement for an entity, such as the company you work for, you represent to us that you have legal authority to bind that entity. Please see Section 10 for definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement.

We may make, directly or through third parties, any inquiries we consider necessary to validate information that you provide to us, including checking commercial databases. You authorize us to obtain one or more of your credit reports to establish, update, or renew your account with us or upon a dispute relating to this Agreement and activity under your account. By submitting your personal information you agree that it will be subject to the Azion Privacy Policy currently referenced at [https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/agreements/privacy-policy/](/en/documentation/agreements/privacy-policy/) as we may update it from time to time.

**3. Listings.** You may list Your Marketplace Content in the Azion Marketplace subject to the following terms:

**3.1 Review of Listings.** You are responsible for evaluating and testing software in Your Marketplace Content before submitting it to Azion to confirm that it complies with this Agreement and our Policies and operates properly with the web services offered by Azion. In connection with the purposes contemplated under this Agreement, we may review and test Your Marketplace Content submitted for listing in Azion Marketplace at any time, including for security-related concerns and to check the accuracy of descriptions and other materials in Your Marketplace Content. We may accept or reject Your Marketplace Content (a) for legal, regulatory, fraud and abuse prevention, or security reasons; (b) to restrict products or activities that we deem unsafe, inappropriate, or offensive; or (c) if Your Marketplace Content otherwise violates the terms of this Agreement or our Policies. You will cooperate with our review and testing. For the avoidance of doubt, this section does not apply to services listed in Azion Experts.

**3.2 Responsibility for Your Marketplace Content.** You are responsible for Your Marketplace Content. Subject to Section 3.6 of this Agreement, you will establish the pricing, license rights and other terms governing Azion Marketplace customers’ (**“Subscribers”**) use of Your Marketplace Content. If you do not specify license rights for Your Marketplace Content, then you agree to license Your Marketplace Content to Subscribers on the same terms that we license software offered by Azion to Subscribers. You will ensure that all information about Your Marketplace Content (including information about applicable fees) displayed on the Azion Site is, at all times, accurate, complete, not misleading, and in compliance with applicable law. Except as provided in this Agreement, Azion obtains no rights under this Agreement from you to Your Marketplace Content.

**3.3 Representations and Warranties.** You represent and warrant that:

(1) you have the lawful right to any of Your Marketplace Content that you promote, license, sell or grant access to Subscribers through Azion Marketplace, and the sale or license of Your Marketplace Content shall not be in violation of such rights or applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to, in the case of Data Products, (i) any requirements to provide notice to and/or obtain consent from the individual to whom the data relates and (ii) any restrictions or requirements that apply to cross-border transfers of such data; and

(2) with respect to Data Products only, to the extent Your Marketplace Content contains any data that (i) identifies or can be used by a Subscriber or other third party to identify a natural person or (ii) otherwise may be deemed to be personal data or personal information under applicable laws or regulations, then such data:

​	(a) has already lawfully been made available to the general public, such as via governmental records, widely distributed media, or legally required public disclosures; and

​	(b) does not include sensitive data or sensitive information about an individual or shall not otherwise be deemed to be sensitive data or sensitive information under applicable laws and regulations, including information relating to biometric or genetic data, health, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex or sexual orientation, trade union membership, or personal payment or financial information (collectively, “**Sensitive Personal Data**”). For example, none of Your Marketplace Content may include (i) any consumer reports as defined in the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended (“**FCRA**”), (ii) nonpublic personal information as defined under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, as amended (“**GLBA**”), (iii) protected health information as defined under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended (“**HIPAA**”) that has not been de-identified in compliance with HIPAA, or (iv) special categories of personal data as defined in the General Data Protection Regulation, as amended (“**GDPR**”).

**3.4 Maintenance and Removal of Your Marketplace Content.**

(1) You will ensure that all software in Your Marketplace Content is up-to-date with current bug fixes and patches. You will ensure that all underlying content of your Data Products are up-to-date and free of viruses, worms, Trojan horses, disabling programming instructions or other such items that may threaten, infect, damage, disable or otherwise interfere with the permitted use of the respective product. If Azion determines that an update to the runtime environment used in Your Marketplace Content is necessary or desirable, we may, but do not need to, contact you to request that you update and resubmit Your Marketplace Content in accordance with Section 3.1. If we provide notice to you to update and resubmit Your Marketplace Content, and you fail to do so within the time specified in such notice, then Azion reserves the right to remove Your Marketplace Content from Azion Marketplace and (if applicable) cancel any underlying subscriptions to Your Marketplace Content that utilize any web services offered by Azion.

(2) You may remove a listing of or offer for Your Marketplace Content from Azion Marketplace at any time in accordance with Azion Marketplace Listing Guidelines. We may also remove any listing or offer for Your Marketplace Content from Azion Marketplace at any time and in the case of Data Products, cancel any underlying subscriptions (i) for legal, regulatory, fraud and abuse prevention, or security reasons; (ii) to restrict products or activities that we deem unsafe, inappropriate, or offensive; or (iii) if Your Marketplace Content otherwise violates the terms of this Agreement or our Policies.

(3) Any removal by you of any listing or offer of Your Marketplace Content from Azion Marketplace will apply to prospective Subscribers only and you will continue to enable current Subscribers to use Your Marketplace Content after removal of the listing or offer until that Subscriber terminates their use.

**3.5 Our Role.** You will be the seller of record for Your Marketplace Content. We certify that we will not retain, use or disclose any underlying content of Your Marketplace Content for any purpose other than providing services to you in accordance with this Agreement. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, we are not involved in any underlying transaction between you and any Subscriber. We are not responsible for any dispute between you and any Subscriber, but we may elect to assist in resolving any dispute between you and any Subscriber. If we elect to assist in the resolution of a dispute, you agree to cooperate with us to resolve the dispute.

**3.6 Fair Treatment of Our Subscribers.** If You offer Your Marketplace Content to Subscribers on terms and conditions (including but not limited to price) on less favorable to the same offering(s) on Similar Sales Channels and you fail to cure after being given 30 days notice, then we may terminate the Agreement for convenience. Examples of less favorable terms include (a) your total fees and charges for Your Marketplace Content exceed the lowest total fees and charges you offer through any Similar Sales Channels and (b) making available in Azion Marketplace some but not all of your software and data products (including all versions) that you make available through any Similar Sales Channel unless we choose to only sell some of your solutions.

**3.7 Subscriber Ratings and Feedback.** We may implement mechanisms that rate, or allow Subscribers to rate and provide feedback about, Your Marketplace Content (including information about Your Marketplace Content that was removed from Azion Marketplace), you, and your performance in connection with Your Marketplace Content and Azion Marketplace or Azion Experts. We may make these ratings and feedback publicly available.

**3.8 Technical Support and Subscriber Service.** You are solely responsible for technical support (if any) for Your Marketplace Content. You must make Subscriber support (i.e., non-technical) contact details available for each of your Data Products. To be clear, this section does not create an obligation that you provide technical support for Your Marketplace Content, but we need not provide Subscriber support or technical support to any Subscriber of Your Marketplace Content.

**3.9 Subscriber Information.** Except as expressly set forth in this Section 3.9 or as otherwise expressly permitted by us, you may use Subscriber Information only (i) to communicate with Subscribers who acquire rights to Your Marketplace Content (x) to provide customer training and technical support and (y) for software or data subscription activation, configuration and customization of content delivered via a software-as-a-service model; (ii) for computation of your internal sales metrics; or (iii) for compliance verification purposes related to Subscribers seeking to acquire rights to the underlying content of your Data Products. You may not use Subscriber Information for any other purpose, unless otherwise agreed in writing between you and the respective Subscriber. For example, you may not, directly or indirectly: (a) disclose any Subscriber Information to any third party, except as necessary for you to perform your obligations under this Agreement and only if you ensure that every recipient uses the information only for that purpose and complies with any restrictions applicable to you; (b) use any Subscriber Information in any way inconsistent with applicable privacy policies or law; or (c) disparage us, our aﬃliates or any of their or our respective products; Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may use Subscriber Information for your marketing or promotional purposes in accordance with applicable privacy policies and law provided that such marketing or promotional communications complies with all applicable laws. Authorized Resellers may also share Subscriber information with ISVs for ISVs to use as described in (i) and (ii) of this section as long as Authorized Resellers have obtained the consent of the Subscribers to share the Subscriber Information. This section does not prevent you from using other information that you acquire without reference to Subscriber Information for any purpose, even if that information is identical to Subscriber Information, as long as you do not target communications based on the intended recipient being a Subscriber.

**3.10 Marketing Restriction.** You may not include in Your Marketplace Content, any advertisements or promotions for, or opportunities for a Subscriber to purchase, products or services that you do not list in Azion Marketplace. If you choose to market or make other references to the availability of Your Marketplace Content, you must refer to Azion Marketplace or use an approved logo provided by us, in compliance with any trademark usage guidelines we specify.

**3.11 Other Rights.** During the term of this Agreement and for so long as Subscribers may use Your Marketplace Content, you grant us a nonexclusive, worldwide license to: (a) reproduce, distribute, display, transmit, promote, and otherwise digitally make available (via all means of online and electronic distribution), Your Marketplace Content (Reseller Content instead for Authorized Resellers) to provide services to you in accordance with this Agreement, provided that no Subscriber shall be provided access to the underlying product of Your Marketplace Content without an active subscription; (b) use (i) your trademarks and logos in the form you provide them to us (with any modifications to optimize their viewing), and (ii) limited portions of Your Marketplace Content (Reseller Content instead for Authorized Resellers) (e.g., product description) for marketing Your Marketplace Content or Azion Marketplace and (c) access, display, promote and otherwise use Your Marketplace Content other than Paid Listings of Data Products (Reseller Content instead for Authorized Resellers) for demonstrating Your Marketplace Content for potential Subscribers. Use of or access to Your Marketplace Content (Reseller Content instead for Authorized Resellers) by Azion for the purposes specified in this section is under the foregoing license and the terms of this Agreement, and such license expressly supersedes any click-through, browse wrap and/or other terms related to Your Marketplace Content (Reseller Content instead for Authorized Resellers). For the sake of clarity, the foregoing license shall be limited in all respects to the purposes and transactions contemplated under this Agreement. We may permit our affiliates and independent contractors to exercise the rights that you grant to us in this Agreement. We assume all liability and responsibility for our affiliates’ and independent contractors’ compliance with, or breach of, the terms of this Agreement.

**3.12 Data Privacy.** If the GDPR applies to our processing of your personal data in Your Marketplace Content:

(1) We will process your personal data in accordance with the instructions provided to us via configuration tools such as the Azion Real-Time Manager and APIs made available by Azion for Azion Marketplace, which includes our technical and organizational measures. Due to the nature of the Azion Marketplace, certain technical measures (which were otherwise optional for you) will be automatically applied by us (e.g., encryption of all Data Products).

(2) Unless otherwise instructed by you, you instruct us to continue to process your personal data in Your Marketplace Content for an active subscription until its expiration or termination.

**4. Reselling on Azion Marketplace.** For the avoidance of doubt, this section does not apply to the third party services listed in Azion Experts.

**4.1 Eligibility.** As agreed by you and another seller or provider on Azion Marketplace, you may (i) designate such other person or entity as a reseller of one or more products for which you have a Paid Listing on Azion Marketplace (in such case, you are an independent software vendor or **“ISV”**), or (ii) accept a designation as a reseller of such other person or entity’s product(s) on Azion Marketplace (in such case, you are an **“Authorized Reseller”**) in accordance with these terms and conditions. To be eligible to use this Azion Marketplace feature, Authorized Reseller and ISV each must be an Azion customer and each must accept the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

**4.2 Authorized Resale Products.** ISV must have a Paid Listing for each product that it authorizes for resale using this Azion Marketplace feature (each an **“Authorized Resale Product”**). ISV’s Paid Listing fulfills the requirement under Section 1 of this Agreement for Authorized Reseller’s eligibility to offer Authorized Resale Products through Azion Marketplace. If ISV has submitted the Authorized Resale Product to us and we have approved it for listing as set forth in Section 3.1, Authorized Reseller need not submit the same Authorized Resale Product to us for review and approval.

**4.3 Establishing Resellers.** To designate or accept a designation as an Authorized Reseller, ISV and Authorized Reseller must complete and agree to an Azion Marketplace Reseller Authorization Form that identifies the specific Authorized Resale Products and the price that Authorized Reseller will pay to ISV for the Authorized Resale Products consistent with the functionality available in Azion Marketplace. To be clear, while the Authorized Reseller must make payments to the ISV, the processing of payments will be as described in Section 5.1. By designating an Authorized Reseller, ISV agrees to sell to Authorized Reseller the specified Authorized Resale Products for resale only and authorizes Authorized Reseller to issue offers for, and resell via offers, the same Authorized Resale Products to Subscribers in Azion Marketplace. By accepting a designation as an Authorized Reseller, Authorized Reseller agrees to purchase the Authorized Resale Products from ISV at the designated price set forth in the Azion Marketplace Reseller Authorization Form solely for resale to Subscribers and to conduct such resales using offers in Azion Marketplace. In addition, ISV and Authorized Reseller may, as agreed by them, specify special pricing that Authorized Reseller will pay to ISV for a custom resale transaction under which Authorized Reseller will issue an offer for, and resell via such offer, the specified product(s) to a designated Subscriber by completing and agreeing to a Custom Resale Transaction Request.

**4.4 Resale Transactions.** Each resale by Authorized Reseller of an Authorized Resale Product to a Subscriber includes a contemporaneous sale of the same Authorized Resale Product from ISV to Authorized Reseller. Each such sale and resale is a Transaction as defined in Section 10.

**4.5 Price Modifications.** To the extent that ISV’s price to Authorized Reseller for an Authorized Resale Product is based on the publicly available price of the corresponding Paid Listing, ISV and Authorized Reseller acknowledge and agree that if ISV modifies the publicly available price for the corresponding Paid Listing, such modification will also modify the price Authorized Reseller pays to ISV for sale of such Authorized Resale Product under the applicable Azion Marketplace Reseller Authorization. Modification of the publicly available price by ISV will not modify the pricing payable by Authorized Reseller for Authorized Resale Products (i) already purchased by Authorized Reseller, or (ii) already offered for resale by Authorized Reseller prior to the ISV’s price modification.

**4.6 Use of Data.** Unless otherwise agreed by the applicable Subscriber, as between Authorized Reseller and ISV, Subscribers are purchasing Authorized Resale Products only from Authorized Reseller and such resales by Authorized Reseller do not create a Subscriber relationship with ISV. Authorized Reseller will not, except as expressly permitted under Section 3.9, disclose to ISV any Subscriber Information arising from Authorized Reseller’s resales of Authorized Resale Products to Subscribers or allow ISV to use any such Subscriber Information. ISV and Authorized Reseller each represent, warrant and covenant that any data or information that it transmits or provides to us or to the other, including any such data or information that we convey to ISV or Authorized Reseller for the other in connection with this Azion Marketplace feature or any Transactions contemplated by this Section, whether proposed or actual, was collected, stored, processed, disclosed and used consistent, in all ways, with applicable privacy policies and law, and that the receipt, storage, use, processing, disclosure or transmission of such data by us or others in connection with this Azion Marketplace feature and the Transactions contemplated by the this Section does not require and does not depend on the need to obtain any additional consents, authorization, or other rights or permissions from any other person or entity.

**4.7 Termination of Reseller Authorization.** Either ISV or Authorized Reseller (the **“Terminating Party”**) may notify us at any time that it wishes to terminate an applicable Azion Marketplace Reseller Authorization. The Terminating Party represents and warrants that its termination of any Azion Marketplace Reseller Authorization complies with the terms and conditions of its agreement with Authorized Reseller or ISV, as applicable.

**4.8 Implementation of Termination.** Upon receipt of a termination notice under Section 4.7 or upon any termination of this Agreement by ISV or Authorized Reseller, we will implement such termination within a reasonable period by (i) removing (a) Authorized Reseller’s ability to purchase Authorized Resale Products from ISV under the applicable Azion Marketplace Reseller Authorization Form and any Azion Marketplace Custom Resale Transaction Request Form, and (b) Authorized Reseller’s ability to issue offers for the same for resale to Subscribers and (ii) removing any offers for Authorized Resale Products issued by Authorized Reseller that have not yet been consummated. Once termination is implemented, we will not facilitate any further Transactions as described in the applicable Azion Marketplace Reseller Authorization Form or any Azion Marketplace Custom Resale Transaction Request Form (ongoing subscriptions obtained through earlier Transactions will not be affected). However, ISV and Authorized Reseller acknowledge and agree we may continue to facilitate Transactions under applicable Azion Marketplace Reseller Authorization Form(s) and Azion Marketplace Custom Resale Transaction Request Form(s) until implementation of termination is complete, and this Agreement will continue to apply to such Transactions.

**4.9 No Interference.** Neither ISV nor Authorized Reseller will interfere with or prejudice the other’s performance of its obligations under this Agreement before or after termination of any Azion Marketplace Reseller Authorization.

**5. Additional Terms for Paid Listings.** If Your Marketplace Content is listed as a Paid Listing, the terms in this Section also apply. All non-Paid Listings of Your Marketplace Content (e.g., bring your own license or free trials of a Data Product) must have a corresponding Paid Listing in Azion Marketplace no later than 90 days after the initial listing of the non-Paid Listing version, unless we determine that we cannot accept Paid Listings from you for regulatory reasons. Any license governing software or data (as applicable) made available via a non-Paid Listing (regardless of the channel used to sell such license) must allow the licensee to use such software or data on Azion without additional fees (including additional support fees), costs, requirements, or restrictions.

**5.1 Processing of Transactions; Collection of Transaction Proceeds.** You hereby appoint us as your payment processing agent for the limited purpose of receiving payments on your behalf from Subscribers or Authorized Resellers (“**Users**”). On your behalf, we will process all payments and refunds for Transactions and collect the applicable Transaction Proceeds. Receipt of funds from Users by us on your behalf for Your Marketplace Content will be deemed receipt of funds from Users by you and will satisfy the obligations owed to you by Users in the amount of the applicable payment by the User. We do not guarantee payment on behalf of any Subscribers, including payments owed to ISV from Authorized Resellers, but nonpayment by Subscribers will not excuse payments owed by Authorized Resellers to ISVs. Unless you have enabled Subscribers to use an existing license to use Your Marketplace Content (e.g., Bring Your Own Subscription for Data Products and Bring Your Own License for software listings), you will ensure that all fees and charges payable by Subscribers for Your Marketplace Content are billed and collected through us and you will not offer or establish any alternative means of payment. Other than with respect to Data Products, we may impose transaction limits on some or all Subscribers and sellers/providers relating to the value of any Transaction or disbursement, the cumulative value of all Transactions or disbursements during a time period or the number of Transactions per day or other time period. We may withhold for investigation, or refuse to process, any of your Transactions that we suspect is fraudulent, unlawful or otherwise violates the terms of this Agreement or our Policies. For the sake of clarity, we will not pay you any fees where we are using Your Marketplace Content for our testing, support, demonstration, or other sales support of Your Marketplace Content as necessary to exercise our rights under Sections 3.1 and 3.11 of this Agreement.

**5.2 Remittance of Transaction Proceeds to You.** At the end of each month, we will pay to you all previously unpaid Transaction Proceeds that we have fully collected as of the date that is 2 business days before the date of payment, provided that Transaction Proceeds from the resale of Authorized Resale Products will be subject to Section 5.3. We will deduct from each payment any Fees due to us related to Your Marketplace Content and the associated Transaction(s). We may also withhold, deduct, or setoff any amounts payable by you to us or our affiliates against any Transaction Proceeds. No Transaction Proceeds will be payable to you for our use of Your Marketplace Content for the purposes described in Section 3.11. All payments to you will be sent to your designated bank account. If there is an error in the processing of any Transaction, you authorize us to debit or credit your designated bank account, to correct such error, provided that any such correction is made in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. If we cannot debit your designated bank account for any reason, you authorize us to resubmit the debit, plus any applicable fees, to any other bank account or payment instrument that you have on file with us or to deduct the debit and applicable fees from future Transaction Proceeds.

**5.3 Resale Transaction Proceeds.** Amounts payable to ISVs from Authorized Resellers for the sale of Authorized Resale Products will be disbursed from Transaction Proceeds that we collect from the contemporaneous resale of such Authorized Resale Products by Authorized Resellers. We do not separately collect payment from Authorized Resellers of the price payable to ISVs for sales of Authorized Resale Products. We will disburse Transaction Proceeds from each resale of an Authorized Resale Product in the following order: (i) we will deduct the Reseller Processing Fee and the ISV Listing Fee for the contemporaneous sale from ISV to Authorized Reseller, (ii) we will disburse remaining Transaction Proceeds to ISV up to the price for the Authorized Resale Product payable by the Authorized Reseller as set forth in the applicable Azion Marketplace Reseller Authorization Form or, if applicable, the Azion Marketplace Custom Resale Transaction Request Form, and (iii) we will disburse any remaining Transaction Proceeds to Authorized Reseller. We do not guarantee payment to ISV on behalf of Authorized Reseller. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, ISV will bear the sole risk of payment in full from Authorized Reseller. If following payment from us to ISV of Transaction Proceeds as set forth above, there is any Shortfall, such Shortfall must be paid by the Authorized Reseller. We have no obligation or liability for any such Shortfall or Authorized Reseller debt.

**5.4 Taxes.** You are responsible for the calculation, invoicing (if required), validation and payment of all sales, use, excise, import, export, value-added, withholding and other taxes and duties assessed, incurred or required to be collected (“**Taxes**”) or paid for any reason in connection with any Transaction and with Your Marketplace Content. We need not determine whether any Taxes apply to any Transaction, and we are not responsible for remitting Taxes to any taxing authority for any Transaction, or for reporting any information (including the payment of Taxes) for any Transaction. Despite the foregoing, when we are legally obligated by a valid taxing authority, we will collect Taxes, and we will provide Subscribers with a compliant tax invoice. All fees and payments payable by you to Azion under this Agreement are exclusive of any applicable taxes, deductions or withholding (including but not limited to cross-border withholding taxes). If any such taxes (for example, cross-border withholding taxes) are required to be withheld on any payment, you will pay such additional amounts as are necessary to the appropriate recipient so that the net amount received by Azion is equal to the amount then due and payable under this Agreement. The following applies only if you are incorporated or organized under the laws of Australia and subject to A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 (Cth) (the “**GST Act**”): All supplies made by you through Azion Marketplace (other than GST-free or input taxed supplies) will be treated as if they were inbound intangible consumer supplies made through Azion Marketplace for the purposes of Section 84-60(1) of the GST Act. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing in this Agreement shall, or shall be interpreted or construed to, induce or require either party hereto to act in any manner (including taking or failing to take any actions in connection with a transaction) which is inconsistent with or penalized under any U.S. laws, regulations, rules or requirements that apply to any party to the Agreement.

**5.5 Risk of Loss.** We will bear the risk of fraud associated with our sale or license of the web services offered by Azion, which does not include your Marketplace Content. You will bear all other risk of fraud or loss, including the risk of chargebacks or credit card fraud associated with your sale or license of Your Marketplace Content. If we receive a chargeback or determine a payment related to a Transaction resulted from fraud, then you will promptly reimburse us for the total amount of any applicable Transaction Proceeds paid to you, as well as all credit card association, bank or other payment processing, re-presentment and/or penalty fees associated with the original Transaction.

**5.6 Cancellations and Refunds.** Unless required by the Azion Marketplace Listing Guidelines, you will post your cancellation and refund policy in the listing or offer for Your Marketplace Content in Azion Marketplace or in any Custom Terms (as that term is defined in the Terms and Conditions for Azion Experts) that you specify in the Azion Experts console. At a minimum, this cancellation and refund policy must: (a) allow Subscribers who subscribe to Your Marketplace Content to exercise any rights to cancel subscriptions to Your Marketplace Content through the Azion Marketplace; and (b) comply with the other requirements of this Agreement, including the Azion Marketplace Listing Guidelines. You will accept and process cancellations of, and provide refunds and adjustments for, Your Marketplace Content in accordance with the cancellation and refund policy posted at the time of the applicable Transaction and as otherwise required by law. You will route all Transaction refund (and adjustment) payments through us. We will credit the applicable account, and you will reimburse us for all amounts so refunded.

**5.7 Removal.** Upon removal of the listing or offer of Your Marketplace Content, you will continue to support Your Marketplace Content to current Subscribers for at least 90 days following removal of the listing, unless otherwise stated in the terms with the Subscriber governing use of Your Marketplace Content. If you are an ISV, you will continue to support the Authorized Resale Products to Authorized Reseller until Authorized Reseller’s obligations to its current Subscribers for such Authorized Resale Products are completed.

**6. Term and Termination.** The term of this Agreement will begin on the Effective Date of registration and will continue until terminated. Either party may terminate this Agreement for any or no reason by providing 30 days’ written notice to the other party. Following termination of this Agreement, you will allow existing Subscribers to continue to use Your Marketplace Content on terms and conditions (including price) at least as favorable as those in effect at the time of termination (but in any event consistent with the requirements of Section 3.2) for the greater of (a) 90 days or (b) the term of the contract that the Subscriber signed up for, and on your behalf, we will continue to process all payments and refunds for Transactions and collect the applicable Transaction Proceeds in accordance with Section 5. Despite anything in this Agreement to the contrary, we may terminate an existing Subscriber’s use of Your Marketplace Content (y) at any time in accordance with our agreement with the Subscriber or (z) upon termination of this Agreement for any or no reason.

**7. Indemnification.**

**7.1 General.** You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us, our affiliates and licensors, and each of their and our respective employees, officers, directors, and representatives from and against any loss, claim, liability, damage, action or cause of action (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or relating to any third party claim, including any claim brought by an ISV or Reseller against us, concerning: (a) alleged infringement, misappropriation, or violation of any third-party rights by Your Marketplace Content (Reseller Content instead for Authorized Resellers), or by the copying, use, distribution, sale, development, design, production, advertising or marketing of Your Marketplace Content (Reseller Content instead for Authorized Resellers); (b) a dispute between you and any ISV, Reseller or Subscriber to Your Marketplace Content; (c) any royalties or payments due by you to any third parties as a result of this Agreement; (d) any actual or alleged violation of law, gross negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud by you in connection with Your Marketplace Content; (e) any actual or alleged breach of your representations, warranties or covenants set forth in this Agreement, including but not limited to Section 3.3; and (f) any claim or demand for payment of any Taxes imposed in connection with any Transaction, and for any ﬁnes, penalties, or similar charges imposed as a result of your failure to collect, remit or report any Taxes in connection with any Transaction. We will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless you, your aﬃliates and licensors, and each of their and our respective employees, oﬃcers, directors, and representatives from and against any loss, claim, liability, damage, action or cause of action (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or relating to any third party claim concerning: (a) alleged infringement, misappropriation, or violation of any third-party rights in connection with the services we provide you (excluding Your Marketplace Content) or (b) any actual or alleged violation of law, gross negligence, willful misconduct, or fraud by us in connection with providing the services to You under this Agreement.

**7.2 Process.** The indemnified party will promptly notify the other party of any claim subject to Section 7.1, but a failure to promptly notify the indemnifying party will only affect indemnified party’s obligations under Section 7.1 to the extent that our failure prejudices your ability to defend the claim. The indemnifying party may: (a) use counsel of its own choosing (subject to our written consent) to defend against any claim; and (b) settle the claim as it deems appropriate as long as the indemnifying party obtain indemnified party prior written consent before entering into any settlement if such settlement imposes a continuing obligation on the indemnified party.

**8. Disclaimers; Limitations of Liability.**

**8.1 Generally.** EXCEPT AS MAY BE EXPRESSLY SET FORTH OTHERWISE IN THIS AGREEMENT AND EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW, WE, OUR AFFILIATES AND OUR LICENSORS MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE REGARDING ALL SERVICES, SOFTWARE, OR PRODUCTS PROVIDED BY OR ON BEHALF OF US IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, OR THAT ANY CONTENT WILL BE SECURE OR NOT OTHERWISE LOST OR DAMAGED. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW, WE, OUR AFFILIATES AND OUR LICENSORS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF ANY COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE.
