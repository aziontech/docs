**Edge Orchestrator**\: designed to enable the Customer to orchestrate Edge Services on their own Edge Nodes, accessible through an agent installed on the Customer’s nodes (servers or compatible IoT devices) and managed through a web interface (the Azion Console) and API. These interfaces allow the registration and configuration of the Customer’s Edge Nodes as well as the creation and customization of Edge Services that can be orchestrated in real time on the pre-registered Edge Nodes. The services to be orchestrated are based on configuration files and scripts to be provided by the Customer, and will run on the devices where the agent is installed. Except as otherwise provided in the Customer Agreement or any documents attached to it, Edge Orchestrator will be billed considering (a) Orchestrated Edge Nodes and (b) Total Orchestrated Data.

**Edge Pulse:** designed to monitor, in real time, the performance and quality of users' access to the customer's web applications. Information such as response time when accessing users can be collected, in addition to information from the servers used to respond to the user's request. To activate it, you need to copy the Edge Pulse tag and insert it into the desired HTML pages. In doing so, the Customer declares himself authorized by its users to collect and process the information described above. The data collected may be used by Azion to improve performance and reliability in accessing Edge Applications. AZION IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR: (A) USE THAT WILL BE GIVEN BY THE CUSTOMER TO THE COLLECTED DATA; (B) THE RIGHT THAT THE CUSTOMER HAS TO COLLECT DATA FROM ITS USERS, BECAUSE BY INSERTING THE PULSE TAG IN ITS PAGES WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY AUTHORIZING AZION TO COLLECT THIS INFORMATION. (C) TAG REMOVAL FROM YOUR PAGES IN CASE OF PRODUCT WITHDRAWAL. Azion is committed to not collect any confidential or personal information from its users and also to the correct application of the information collected to constantly improve its delivery algorithms with the clear objective of guaranteeing the best possible experience for those who access our Edge Network. The usage of Edge Pulse must follow the guidelines provided in the product documentation. This way it will guarantee that its execution will be exclusively asynchronous, in other words, it will not impact the loading time and will not interfere in the internal structures of the page where it is inserted. Information related to user navigation will be made available to Customers through Real-Time Events and Data Stream.

**Edge Storage**: designed as a service for efficient, secure, and scalable object storage, organized into buckets that can be either public or private. Each object consists of a unique identifier, its data, and metadata. It includes essential capabilities such as writing and accessing buckets and objects via REST API or S3 protocol. The distribution of objects stored in Edge Storage to end users should be through an Edge Application, which may generate billing based on the corresponding metrics. Direct access to objects stored in Edge Storage, without going through an Edge Application, will be subject to rate limits. By using the storage services offered by Azion, the Customer acknowledges and agrees that they are fully responsible for the content they choose to upload, store, or share through our platform. This includes assuming all risks related to the ownership, legality, and proper use of these materials, ensuring they possess all necessary rights, licenses, consents, and permissions for such. Additionally, the Customer understands that Azion assumes no responsibility for the content stored in its systems, being exempt from any claim related to copyright infringement, trademark, or any other intellectual property right of third parties, as well as any legal liability arising from the content provided by the user. It is the customer's duty to ensure that their content complies with all applicable laws and regulations. Azion will make all commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the availability and durability of the customer's objects stored in our infrastructure, but there are no guarantees against data loss. While we provide the platform and tools necessary for storage, protecting against data loss is the customer's responsibility, who must take proactive measures to ensure the security of their critical data, such as backup and/or snapshot. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Edge Storage will be billed according to the (a) Storage; (b) Class A Operations; and (c) Class B Operations, according to the volumes consumed.

**Edge SQL**: Edge SQL is a serverless, zero-configuration, fully ACID-compliant SQL database designed for read-intensive, distributed, and scalable execution of queries. Built on top of a fast, highly reliable, and full-featured database powered by libSQL, it is replicated across hundreds of Edge Locations based on an eventually consistent semantic model. It includes functionalities such as: (a) standard SQL commands for data manipulation and schema definition, allowing for sophisticated querying, insertion, update, and deletion of data within the main database; (b) advanced query capabilities leveraging a rich set of SQL features, including complex joins, subqueries and window functions for flexible data analysis and retrieval; (c) vector similarity search, ideal for machine learning applications and recommendation systems; and (d) support for transactional operations that are fully ACID-compliant, guaranteeing that all database transactions are processed reliably, with replicas made available in an eventually consistent model. Azion will make all commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the availability and durability of customer data stored in our infrastructure. However, there are no guarantees against data loss or corruption. While we provide the platform and necessary tools for storage, protecting against data loss is ultimately the responsibility of the customer. Customers must take proactive measures to secure their critical data, such as configuring backups and/or snapshots of their databases. Databases that remain inactive for more than 10 (ten) days may have their replicas removed from Azion's edge network. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Edge SQL will be billed based on (a) Total Storage, (b) Rows Read, and (c) Rows Written, according to the volumes consumed.

**Image Processor:** an Edge Application module designed to optimize and dynamically manipulate images, and includes the following features: (1) optimization; (2) cutting; (3) resizing; (4) format conversion, and (5) applying filters such as blurring, noise, watermark, and others. The formats supported are JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP and ICO. Images are manipulated through Query String parameters sent in the request. Image optimization is the process of reducing the image file size, whenever possible, minimizing the quality losses noticeable in the image derived from the optimization process. Images may be delivered in a different file format other than the original, according to users’ access browser, in an effort to improve the delivery (ex: webp). There are no guarantee gains from the optimization process, and customers are tasked with monitoring the average gain from using the service. CUSTOMERS ARE HEREBY ADVISED THAT THE IMAGE OPTIMIZATION PROCESS ALTERS THE CONTENT DELIVERED TO END USERS AND MAY RESULT IN CHANGES TO THE VISUAL QUALITY OF THE IMAGE. AT ANY TIME AND WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE, AZION MAY UPDATE THE OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS AND SUCH CHANGES MAY ALTER THE CONTENTS DELIVERED AND THE OPTIMIZATION EFFICIENCY. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Image Processor will be billed considering the Images Processed according to the volumes consumed.

**Tiered Cache:** designed as an add-on to Edge Cache to provide an additional cache layer between the origin of the Customer and Azion’s Edge, minimizing the volume of requests and traffic to the origin, in cases where it applies. The service has the following features: (1) content cache functionality with TTL equal to or greater than 3 seconds; (2) Real-Time Purge tool; (3) improved edge access to cached content by using persistent hash algorithms. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Tiered Cache will be billed considering (a) Data Transferred and (b) Storage.

**Load Balancer:** an Edge Application module designed to balance customers’ HTTP/HTTPS traffic between origins distributed across multiple datacenter, service providers (multi-cloud) or in the same datacenter. It eliminates or reduces the need for dedicated hardware or software and lowers the impact of local failures on global content availability. Includes access to the following features: (1) Round-Robin balancing, Least Connections and IP Hash; (2) assignment of different weights to origins; (3) primary or backup (standby) server configuration; (4) manipulation of errors and exceptions in case of timeouts when connecting to or getting a response from the origin, or in case the origin’s response error is a supported by Azion. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Load Balancer will be billed considering the Data Transferred according to the volumes consumed.

**Network Layer Protection:** Edge Firewall module designed to control and block access to content and applications directly on Azion's Edge. Access control and blocking can be done by IP address or network (CIDR), geolocation (country of access) and ASN. Azion uses databases from external suppliers to identify geolocation and ASN based on the User's IP address, which may be inaccurate in some situations, with the Customer being responsible for the use of this access restriction functionality. AZION PROVIDES ACCESS CONTROL MECHANISMS BASED ON THE BEST EFFORT, BUT THAT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE UNTRANSPONIBLE RESTRICTIONS AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS. THE CUSTOMER MUST RESTRICT ACCESS BY IP ADDRESS TO OBTAIN THE BEST LEVEL OF CONTROL AND AZION RECOMMENDS THE COMBINATION OF MULTIPLE TECHNIQUES. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Network Layer Protection will be billed considering Requests according to the volumes consumed.

**Origin Shield:** designed as an add-on to the Network Layer Protection module to assist in protecting the Customer's origin, Origin Shield has the following features: (a) access via Azion Console and its API to the complete list of IP/CIDR addresses used by Azion's Products to communicate with the Customer's origins; (b) ensuring that new IP/CIDR addresses added to the Azion network will remain on hold for a period of 7 calendar days, from their inclusion in the Origin Shield listing until they start communicating with the Customer's origins; (c) email notification to the Customer's registered addresses, whenever there is a change in the IP/CIDR addresses used by the Azion network; and (d) discrimination in the History of the Azion Console of the IP/CIDR addresses included and removed in each update of the listing. It is the Customer's responsibility to obtain the list of Origin Shield addresses through the Azion Console or its API and to grant access at their origin, as well as to keep updated the list of email addresses that must receive notification from Azion. Azion will send notification emails, but has no way of guaranteeing that the message will reach the Customer's Mailbox and any error returns from the Customer's email system may result in the message being discarded. It is up to the Customer to keep their Firewall and access policies updated to allow the connection from Azion's servers. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Origin Shield will be billed considering a recurring Origin Shield Fee.

**Platform Feature Development:** is a service provided by Azion, structured as a package of contracted hours for developing new features or improving existing functionalities on the Azion Platform ("Feature Development”). The development will be carried out: (a) in a manner compatible with Azion's existing Products and Services; (b) ensuring integration, usability, and the same SLA applicable to the Platform; (c) following industry protocols and standards; (d) aligned with the scope of Azion's Products and Services; and (e) in compliance with the technical guidelines and the Product Release Stages defined by Azion. A request for a Feature Development must be formalized by the Customer and will be evaluated by Azion, considering technical, commercial, and operational aspects. Azion reserves the right to refuse or suspend the development of any feature that, at its sole discretion, may compromise the security, stability, or regulatory compliance of the Platform. The scope of Platform Feature Development includes internalizing and tracking Customer demands, including the request for Feature Development and its technical and functional specification, in accordance with Azion's adopted practices; periodic technical meetings (weekly, biweekly, or monthly) to monitor ongoing Feature Development; and review and validation of the Feature Development plan. The Customer must provide a detailed scope of the desired functionality, specifying technical and operational requirements. The Customer is solely responsible for validating the feature's functionality after delivery and ensuring compatibility with its applications and external integrations. Azion is not responsible for failures or impacts resulting from the improper use of the developed feature or for modifications made by the Customer without prior validation by Azion. Pricing Model: Unless otherwise stated in the Customer Agreement or attached documents, Platform Feature Development will be charged based on a development hour package, determined according to the complexity and estimated effort required for implementing the requested functionality. Adjustments and Modifications: The Customer may request adjustments or modifications after delivery, subject to a new evaluation by Azion and potential additional charges if there is a change in the original validated request. Cancellation: If the Customer decides to cancel the service before development is completed, Azion may charge for the services already rendered as well as for any incurred operational costs. Platform Feature Development does not include ongoing technical support for the developed functionalities. If the Customer requires support, they must separately contract one of Azion's support plans. The implementation of a feature under Platform Feature Development does not imply an obligation for Azion to maintain or update it indefinitely. Future maintenance and enhancements may be contracted separately. Platform Feature Development is a service provided exclusively by Azion, and Azion is solely responsible for the payment of labor-related fees and associated rights. There is no direct or indirect employment relationship between Azion and the Customer, nor any obligation from the Customer towards the professionals allocated to the service. Platform Feature Development services will be performed remotely, with no obligation for physical attendance at the Customer's premises. THE CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ALL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RELATED TO THE FEATURE DEVELOPED UNDER AZION PLATFORM FEATURE DEVELOPMENT BELONGS EXCLUSIVELY TO AZION.

The designated TAM is a direct employee of Azion, being exclusively responsible for the payment of labor sums and related rights, with no direct or indirect link with the Customer, or any obligation of the latter to TAM. TAM will work remotely, with no obligation to physically attend the Customer's premises. Likewise, the Azion TAM must not be granted access to internal systems or email assignment linked to the Customer. Azion reserves the right to change the Azion TAM assigned to Customer service at its discretion. If the change of the designated Azion TAM is requested by the Customer, Azion will have up to 90 days to designate a new Azion TAM. The Customer undertakes not to hire, persuade, entice or try to attract Azion employees who have been assigned to him for the Azion TAM service, under penalty of paying a fine corresponding to 12 (twelve) times the total monthly value of the Order corresponding service.

Nevertheless, please be advised legitimate application requests may be blocked in case they coincide with any of the WAF security rules. AZION IS CONSTANTLY SEEKING TO UPGRADE OUR SECURITY MECHANISMS TO MAKE OUR PROTECTION SYSTEMS MORE EFFECTIVE AND REDUCE THE RISK OF IMPACTS TO CUSTOMER APPLICATIONS. WE WILL USE SECURITY TEST TOOLS (PENTEST) ON CUSTOMER APPLICATIONS IN ORDER TO IMPROVE SUCH SECURITY MECHANISMS. HOWEVER, THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES THE WAF SERVICE WILL BE ABLE TO PREVENT ALL POSSIBLE ATTACKS OR THREATS. CUSTOMERS SHOULD KEEP SECURITY PRACTICES AT THEIR ORIGINS AS WELL. CUSTOMERS ASSUME ALL RISKS OF SERVICE UNAVAILABILITY OWING TO RULES POORLY CONFIGURED IN THE SERVICE. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, WAF will be billed considering the (a) number of Requests; (b) number of WAF Rules and (c) WAF Rule Sets, according to the volumes consumed.

## 2\. Purchase and Billing Options

**On Demand Agreement:** type of purchase through which Customers pay according to their use of the Azion Products and Services. The amount to be paid by Customer for each Product and Service used corresponds to the volume calculated by Azion for the Calculation Metrics in the billing period times its respective Unit Price, according to the Customer Agreement. When Monthly Consumption Ranges have been specified, the Unit Prices of these Consumption Ranges will apply exclusively to the volumes consumed in the respective Consumption Range and generate a progressive discount as Customer’s consumption increases. Under the On-Demand purchase option, Azion reserves the right to remove the account, contents and other Customer data after 12 months of inactivity by Customer.

**Reserved Capacity Agreement:** type of purchase through which Customer commits to a minimum consumption and payment corresponding to Customer’s Reserved Capacity. In case the Reserved Capacity is used in excess according to the Calculation Metric, the excess use will be charged from the Customer by multiplying the volume which exceeded the Reserved Capacity by the respective Unit Price for the On-Demand purchase model or as defined under the Customer Agreement. The volume that goes unused in a month, if any, can not be carried over and used in subsequent months.

**Savings Plan Agreement**\: a more flexible type of purchase in which Customer commits to a fixed amount for a period of 1 (one), 2 (two) or 3 (three) years and is eligible for discounts over On Demand's price list, which are made available on Azion's webpage. These discounts, which are calculated according to payment terms and the volume of the financial commitment, are applied to the following Products, as well as their modules and add-ons: (1) Edge Application, (2) Edge Firewall, (3) Edge DNS, (4) Data Stream and (5) Real-Time Events. By entering into a Savings Plan Agreement, Customer is acquiring service credits for use on Azion Products and Services during the term of the agreement or until total consumption of said credits, whichever happens first. At the depletion of service credits or term of the Savings Plan Agreement, if Customer remains using Azion Products and Services Customer will be subject to On Demand's price list.

**MB:** megabyte(s), 1 MB = 1,000 kB.

**KB ou kB:** kilobyte(s), 1kB = 1,000 bytes.

## 5\. Product Release Stages

The release of new Products or features by Azion is subject to the following stages:

**Experimental**: this is limited to Azion employees and may, by invitation from Azion, be extended to a closed group of Customers, whose participation implies confidentiality on the part of the Customer. It is a stage prior to Preview for the purpose of testing new Products and features that are still under development. These features or products may be unstable and undergo changes incompatible with previous versions. There is no SLA during this phase, due to it being a test with limited resource availability. Azion’s goal at this stage is to validate functionality and collect feedback from a limited set of Customers or collaborators. At this stage, the Product or feature is generally suitable for use only in the Customer’s testing environments and is not recommended for production environments. This stage has a variable duration, depending on the development time of each feature or product.

**Preview**: During the Preview stage, products or features are ready for testing and will be made available to all Customers on the “Developer” Service Plan and to those customers on other Service Plans who have opted to receive Preview features. This step is often publicly announced by Azion. There are no SLAs during Preview unless otherwise specified in the terms of a particular release. This stage can last up to 6 months, depending on the specific characteristics and specifications of each launch. Generally the Preview stage enables use in test and production environments, and the Customer may be charged for use of the product.

**General Availability**: Products and features in General Availability are open to all customers, covered by Azion's SLAs when applicable, and are ready for use in production environments, according to these Terms of Service.

**Deprecated**: Products and features that are Deprecated are scheduled to be terminated and removed (End-Of-Life, EOL). All customers must be notified according to the rules of the Client Agreement. There is no SLA for Deprecated Products and features, nor is there a commitment to fix bugs or evolve the features of these Products. Azion can terminate the Product and remove the Client's data on the notified End-Of-Life date, with Customers responsible for copying their data and settings or migrating to another Product, when applicable.
