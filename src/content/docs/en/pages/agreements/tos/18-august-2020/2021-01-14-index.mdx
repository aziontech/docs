Unless specified otherwise in the Customer Agreement or any documents attached thereto, Edge Firewall will be charged for the volumes consumed in its modules.

**Edge Functions:** designed to carry out function code execution on Azion's Edge, triggered by a user or device request, without the need for the customer to have to provision or manage the infrastructure to execute it. The function code must receive 3 mandatory parameters: (a) the request handler; (b) the handler for the answer; and (c) a JSON for parameterization of variables. The function code can be used to manipulate or transform the request or response. The created function must be associated with an Edge Application or Edge Firewall, where it must be parameterized through an argument formatted in JSON with the function's variables. The trigger with the conditions for executing the function must be configured in the Edge Application in which the function is associated. Each request that meets the configured execution conditions is considered an invocation ("Invocation") that triggers the execution of the function. A AZION PODERÁ ENCERRAR, SEM AVISO PRÉVIO, A EXECUÇÃO DE FUNÇÕES QUE ESTEJAM: (A) CONSUMING MORE THAN DEFINED MAXIMUM MEMORY; OR (B) PERFORMING FOR LONGER THAN THE MAXIMUM DEFINED. AZION MAY REMOVE FUNCTIONS CREATED AND THAT HAVE NOT BEEN PERFORMED FOR MORE THAN THREE (3) MONTHS. THE CUSTOMER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS CONTENT, INCLUDING: (A) THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CODE YOU USE; (B) LICENSING TO USE THIRD PARTY CODE OR RESPECT TO THE TERMS OF USE OF IT; AND (C) THE SECURITY OF THE SOURCE CODE YOU USE. Unless specified otherwise in the Customer Agreement or any documents attached thereto, Edge Functions will be charged for (a) Compute Time and (b) Invocations, according to the volumes consumed.

**Edge Pulse:** designed to monitor, in real time, the performance and quality of users' access to the customer's web applications. Information such as response time when accessing users can be collected, in addition to information from the servers used to respond to the user's request. To activate it, you need to copy the Edge Pulse tag and insert it into the desired HTML pages. In doing so, the customer declares himself authorized by its users to collect and process the information described above. The data collected may be used by Azion to improve performance and reliability in accessing Edge Applications. AZION IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR: (A) USE THAT WILL BE GIVEN BY THE CUSTOMER TO THE COLLECTED DATA; (B) THE RIGHT THAT THE CUSTOMER HAS TO COLLECT DATA FROM ITS USERS, BECAUSE BY INSERTING THE PULSE TAG IN ITS PAGES WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY AUTHORIZING AZION TO COLLECT THIS INFORMATION.

The usage of Edge Pulse must follow the guidelines provided in the product documentation. This way it will guarantee that its execution will be exclusively asynchronous, in other words, it will not impact the loading time and will not interfere in the internal structures of the page where it is inserted. Information related to user navigation will be made available to customers through reports in Real-Time Events and Data Streaming. 

**Image Processor:** Edge Application module designed to dynamically optimize and manipulate images, including the following features: (1) optimization; (2) cutting; (3) resizing; (4) format conversion and (5) application of filters such as blur, noise, watermark, amongst others. The supported formats are JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP and ICO. The manipulation of images is performed through Query String parameters sent in the request. Image optimization consists of the process of reducing the size of the image file, when possible, seeking to minimize the perceived loss of quality of the image, resulting from the optimization process. The image may be delivered in a file format different from the original, according to the User Access Browser, seeking better delivery optimization (e.g.: webp). There is no guarantee of gain in the optimization process and the customer is responsible for monitoring the average gain resulting from the use of the service. THE CUSTOMER MUST BE AWARE THAT THE IMAGE OPTIMIZATION PROCESS CHANGES THE CONTENT DELIVERED TO THE END USER, MAY RESULT IN DIFFERENCES IN THE VISUAL QUALITY OF THE IMAGE. AZION MAY, AT ANY TIME AND WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE, UPDATE THE OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS, RESULTING IN DIFFERENCES IN THE CONTENT DELIVERED AND IN THE OPTIMIZATION EFFICIENCY. Unless specified otherwise in the Customer Agreement or any documents attached thereto, the Image Processor will be charged for Images Processed according to the volumes consumed.

To adopt our product, you will need to change your appointment at the registration agency where you hired your domain so that it starts using Azion servers. The customer is responsible for renewing their domain names as well as ensuring the correct configuration of their zones, records and responses that they wish to provide through the DNS service. Therefore, Azion is not responsible for any failure to update these records. Azion undertakes not to sell, distribute, reveal or make public any customer information, except in the event of a written judicial request, or in the case of illegal acts by the customer, as well as, but not limited to: fraud, content defamatory etc. Azion is authorized to remove zones created in its database that are not being pointed out by any registration server. The cancellation of the DNS service contract will occur when the customer removes all zones from his account and disables the product in the subscriptions area in Real-Time Manager. Azion will also make a final charge, referring to the hosted zones and the consultations attended until the moment of disconnection. Azion does not make any kind of promise in relation to the service offered to its customers and will not be responsible for any dispute made by customers. In no event will Azion be liable for any direct, indirect, accidental, consequential or any other damage. We cannot take action against abusive material until it is brought to our attention. Unless specified otherwise in the Customer Agreement or any documents attached thereto, the Intelligent DNS will be charged for (a) the total number of Hosted Zones, and (b) the total number of queries answered in a given period (Standard Queries).

Unless specified otherwise in the Customer Agreement or any documents attached thereto, Load Balancer will be charged for Data Transferred according to the volumes consumed.

**Network Layer Protection:** Edge Firewall module designed to control and block access to content and applications directly on Azion's Edge. Access control and blocking can be done by IP address or network (CIDR), geolocation (country of access) and ASN. Azion uses databases from external suppliers to identify geolocation and ASN based on the User's IP address, which may be inaccurate in some situations, with the Customer being responsible for the use of this access restriction functionality. AZION PROVIDES ACCESS CONTROL MECHANISMS BASED ON THE BEST EFFORT, BUT THAT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE UNTRANSPONIBLE RESTRICTIONS AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS. THE CUSTOMER MUST RESTRICT ACCESS BY IP ADDRESS TO OBTAIN THE BEST LEVEL OF CONTROL AND AZION RECOMMENDS THE COMBINATION OF MULTIPLE TECHNIQUES. Unless specified otherwise in the Customer Agreement or any documents attached thereto, Network Layer Protection will be charged for Requests according to the volumes consumed.

**Origin Shield:** designed as an Add-on to the Network Layer Protection Module to assist in protecting the Customer's origin, Origin Shield has the following features: (a) access via Real-Time Manager and its API to the complete list of IP/CIDR addresses used by Azion Products to communicate with the Customer's origins; (b) ensuring that new IP/CIDR addresses added to the Azion network will remain on hold for a period of 7 calendar days, from their inclusion in the Origin Shield listing until they start communicating with the Customer's origins; (c) email notification to the Customer's registered addresses, whenever there is a change in the IP/CIDR addresses used by the Azion network; and (d) discrimination in the History of the Real-Time Manager of the IP/CIDR addresses included and removed in each update of the listing. It is the Customer's responsibility to obtain the list of Origin Shield addresses through the Real-Time Manager or its API and to grant access at their origin, as well as to keep updated the list of email addresses that must receive notification from Azion. Azion will send notification emails, but has no way of guaranteeing that the message will reach the Customer's Mailbox and any error returns from the Customer's email system may result in the message being discarded.

**Internal Access:** is limited to Azion employees. It is a pre-release stage for testing purposes.

**Early Access:** Early Access functionality is limited to a closed group of Customers. Participation is by invitation only from Azion and implies confidentiality on the part of the Customer. These features or Products may be unstable and may undergo changes incompatible with previous versions. There is no SLA for Products or features in Early Access, as it is a test with limited availability of resources, before releases are made for wider use. Azion's goal at this stage is to validate functionality and collect feedback from a limited set of Customers. Products at this stage do not need be complete. At this stage the Product or functionality is generally suitable for use in Customer's test environments only. The Early Access internship can take a few months (1 to 2 months).

**Beta:** in the Beta version, Products or Features are ready for wider testing and use by Customers. The Beta internship is often announced publicly by Azion. There are no SLAs for a Beta version, unless otherwise specified under a specific Beta program. The Beta phase can last for about 6 months. The Beta stage is generally suitable for use in test and production environments, and the Customer may be charged for use of the Product.

**General Availability:**  the Products and features in General Availability are open to all Customers, covered by Azion SLAs when applicable, and are ready for use in a production environment, in accordance with these Terms of Service.

**Deprecated:** Deprecated Products and features are scheduled to be closed and removed (End-Of-Life, EOL). All customers must be notified in accordance with the rules in the Customer Agreement. There is no SLA for Deprecated Products and features, as well as no commitment to fix bugs or improve the functionality of these Products. Azion may terminate the Product and remove Customer data on the notified End-Of-Life date, with Customers being responsible for copying their data and settings or migrating to another Product, when applicable.
