*Last updated: September 18, 2023.*

The following definitions related to Products and Services, billing methods, and other terms apply to the purchase and use of Azion Products and Services. We are constantly looking to improve our solutions. Consequently, this document may be updated and you should always look at its latest version.

All Azion products and services are offered as Edge Services and available through specific Internet communication protocols. Our servers are located at various points of presence (POPs) across the world. Azion Products and Services are orchestrated and configured via the Real-Time Manager interface or its APIs. Products and Services are billed according to their use, type of contract, and prices, as defined in the Customer Agreement.

## 1\. Products and Services

**Application Acceleration:** an Edge Application module designed to accelerate web applications and APIs. It includes access to protocol optimization features, advanced caching rules (Advanced Cache Key) which allows granular caching with minimum TTL of 0 seconds, segmentation and caching policies based on criteria such as name/value of Cookies and Query Strings, in addition to features such as Rules Engine, Bypass Cache, KeepAlive, Forward Cookies, POST Cache, among others. HTTP GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE and OPTIONS methods available. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Application Acceleration will be billed considering the Data Transferred according to the volumes consumed.

**Data Streaming:** designed to collect data from the Edge Applications or any other Azion's Products and Services. The Customer will choose which data to be collected and, by doing so, automatically declare to be authorized to collect all the selected data. AZION DOES NOT HOLD RESPONSIBILITY BY: (A) THE USAGE OF THE DATA BY THE CUSTOMER, (B) THE CUSTOMER RIGHTS TO COLLECT THEIR USER'S DATA. The collected data is sent to the customer's infrastructure using the protocol chosen in the Real-Time Manager interface or API by the Customer, formatted in NDJSON (Newline Delimited JSON) in a configurable template. The data is dispatched in blocks of 2 thousand requests separated by \\n (Newline), or 60 seconds, whichever happens first. Azion will use all commercially reasonable efforts to send all the data to the Customer's infrastructure, or its suppliers, in real time or with a delay lower than 3 minutes. However, in the case of access peaks, attacks or external causes, the delay can be greater. THE CUSTOMER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE AVAILABILITY OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO RECEIVE THE DATA AND, IN CASE OF UNAVAILABILITY, AZION CAN DISCARD THE DATA. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Data Streaming will be billed considering the (a) Data Streaming Requests and (b) Data Streamed, according to the volumes consumed.

**DDoS Protection:** DDoS Protection will be provided exclusively under the terms available at https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/ddos-protection/ (“Guidelines”). By using Azion, Customer (i) authorizes Azion to impose the technical measures available on the Azion platform to control or mitigate DDoS attacks, even though such measures may result in performance degradation, and (ii) acknowledges that the Service Level Agreement ("SLA") does not apply while a DDoS attack is underway. The following Azion DDoS Protection service options are available: (i) DDoS Protection - 5 Gbps: includes the following features: (a) network flow analysis (layers 3 and 4); (b) detection of the most common DDoS attacks, network and transport layers, and (c) mitigation of the most common DDoS attacks, network and transport layers, up to the limit of 5 Gbps; (ii) DDoS Protection - 20 Gbps, includes all of the DDoS Protection - 5 Gbps features plus: (a) detection of more sophisticated DDoS attacks; (b) cost protection via service credits, when applicable; (c) mitigation of larger DDoS attacks up to 20 Gbps; (iii) DDoS Protection - 50 Gbps extends the protection against DDoS attacks up to 50 Gbps; and (iv) DDoS Protection - Unlimited, for unlimited protection against DDoS attacks, the mitigation may use the entire Azion network, in addition to 24x7 access to our Security Response Team (SRT) upon the purchase our Support Mission Critical service. Attacks exceeding the volumes purchased may be immediately blocked until the attack ends. To be eligible for a Service Credit (a) the DDoS attack must result in a bill that exceed the double of the average monthly consumption in the previous six (6) months, excluding the months in which a DDoS attack took place; (b) in the event of an impossibility to calculate the average monthly consumption in the previous six months, the average consumption volume in the available months will be used as basis; (c) Customer must notify the Azion Technical Support about an attack underway by registering a Support Ticket; (d) the Azion Technical Support must have determined the reported DDoS attack is a legitimate attack; and (e) credit applications must be sent by Customer within 30 days after the disputed service bill is closed. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Managed DDoS Protection will be billed at (a) a monthly set fee according to the protection limit purchased (Protection Fee) and, additionally, (b) a fee per total GB traffic (Total Data Transferred). By purchasing our Managed DDoS Protection service, the Customer will be required to pay for a minimum of twelve (12) months of the service. In the event Customer’s average bill exceeds the volume purchased, or in case more than two credits are applied for in a given calendar year, Azion will be entitled to require Customer to pay an additional DDoS Protection Fee for each attack suffered. Only a single credit may be applied each month, even when several attacks take place in the same month. Credits are to be issued as a credit note instead of a revised bill. AZION IS CONSTANTLY SEEKING TO UPGRADE OUR SECURITY MECHANISMS TO MAKE OUR PROTECTION SYSTEMS MORE EFFECTIVE AND REDUCE THE RISK OF IMPACTS TO CUSTOMER APPLICATIONS. HOWEVER, THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES THE DDOS SERVICE WILL BE ABLE TO PREVENT ALL POSSIBLE ATTACKS OR THREATS. CUSTOMERS SHOULD KEEP SECURITY CONTROLS AT THEIR ORIGINS AS WELL. CUSTOMERS ASSUME ALL RISKS OF SERVICE UNAVAILABILITY OWING TO RULES POORLY CONFIGURED IN THE SERVICE.

**Digital Certificates:** this service brokers and obtains the issuance of shared SSL certificates of the Domain Validated (DV) type from a Certification Authority (CA) chosen by Azion, to be used solely for the Edge Application service. Customers must be able to prove their authority over the desired domains by following the technical procedures set by the CA. SSL certificates and private keys are shared among multiple Customers and will be held exclusively by Azion. Under no circumstances whatsoever will certificates and/or private keys be sent to the Customers. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Digital Certificates will be billed considering the number of Digital Certificates according to the volumes consumed.

**Edge Application:** designed to enable Customers to build and run their own serverless applications at the Edge of the network, closer to users and devices. It is the ideal solution for applications that require low latency response time or real-time data processing. Each Edge Application can be assigned to multiple domains which can be accessed by users and devices. To guarantee the proper working of the service, Azion may enable, disable or modify services, POPs, IPs addresses, servers, any equipment or Customer content, without previous notice, always aiming the maintenance or performance improvement and availability. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Edge Application will be billed considering the number of (a) Domains, (b) Edge Applications, (c) Total Data Transferred, and (d) Requests, according to the volumes consumed, and the volume consumed by its modules.

Includes access to (1) the Azion network for content delivery; (2) content caching feature with minimum TTL of 60 seconds; (3) HTTP header manipulation; (4) creation of redirecting or content delivery rules; (5) the Real-Time Purge tool; (6) delivery of cached content while the origin is inaccessible; (7) delivery of HTTPS (TLS) with OCSP Stapling support; (8) digital certificate uploads and support for the TLS x509 SNI format, in case it is supported by the user’s browser, or use of the shared certificate in Azion’s domain; (9) integration with Azion Products and Services. To use this service, Customers need to store the original version of their Content in an origin web server with HTTP access. THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES THAT CONTENTS (OBJECTS) WILL BE AVAILABLE IN CACHE THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE TIME-TO-LIVE (TTL) CONFIGURED BY THE CUSTOMER. AZION MAKES THE NECESSARY INVESTMENTS TO KEEP DATA CACHED FOR THE CLOSEST TIME TO THAT CONFIGURED BY CUSTOMERS, HOWEVER, LEAST ACCESSED OBJECTS MAY BE AUTOMATICALLY DELETED FROM THE CACHE TO MAKE ROOM FOR MORE OFTEN ACCESSED OBJECTS VIA AN LRU (LEAST RECENTLY USED) ALGORITHM. MAXIMUM OBJECT SIZE IS 10GB. TO USE THE SERVICE WITH LARGER OBJECTS, CUSTOMERS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE A WRITTEN AUTHORIZATION FROM AZION. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Edge Caching will be billed according to the (a) Total Data Transferred; (b) Requests; and (c) Real-Time Purge Operations, according to the volumes consumed.

**Edge Firewall:** designed for Customers to build and run their firewall rules at the Edge of the network, closest to users and devices. Each Edge Firewall can be linked to multiple domains, which in turn are accessible by users and devices. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Edge Firewall will be billed according to the volumes consumed in its modules.

**Edge Functions:** designed to run the function's code on Azion's Edge, triggered by a request from the user or device, without the need of Customer provisioning or managing the underlying infrastructure. The function's code must receive 3 parameters: (a) the request's handler, (b) the reponse's handler, and (c) a JSON containing the variables parameterization. The function's code can be used to manipulate or transform the request or response. The created function must be associated to an Edge Application or Edge Firewall, where it can be parametrized by and argument formatted in JSON containing the function's variables. The trigger carrying the conditions to execute the function must be configured on the Edge Application or Edge Firewall associated to the function. Each request that comply with the configured runtime conditions is considered an Invocation which triggers the function's executions. AZION MAY CEASE, WITHOUT PREVIOUS NOTICE, THE FUNCTION'S EXECUTION: (A) CONSUMING MORE THAN THE MAXIMUM MEMORY DEFINED, (B) EXECUTING FOR LONGER THAN THE MAXIMUM DEFINED. AZION MAY REMOVE FUNCTIONS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN EXECUTED FOR MORE THAN THREE (3) MONTHS. CUSTOMER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN CONTENT, INCLUDING: (A) THE CODE'S PERFORMANCE, (B) THE LICENSE FOR USE OF A THIRD PARTY CODE OR THE RESPECT TO THE TERMS OF USE, AND (C) THE SECURITY OF THE SOURCE CODE USED. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Edge Functions will be billed considering (a) Compute Time and (b) Invocations, according to the volume consumed.

**Edge Orchestrator**\: designed to enable the Customer to orchestrate Edge Services on their own Edge Nodes, accessible through an agent installed on the Customer’s nodes (servers or compatible IoT devices) and managed through a web interface (the Real-Time Manager) and API. These interfaces allow the registration and configuration of the Customer’s Edge Nodes as well as the creation and customization of Edge Services that can be orchestrated in real time on the pre-registered Edge Nodes. The services to be orchestrated are based on configuration files and scripts to be provided by the Customer, and will run on the devices where the agent is installed. Except as otherwise provided in the Customer Agreement or any documents attached to it, Edge Orchestrator will be billed considering &nbsp;(a) Orchestrated Edge Nodes and (b) Total Orchestrated Data.

**Edge Pulse:** designed to monitor, in real time, the performance and quality of users' access to the customer's web applications. Information such as response time when accessing users can be collected, in addition to information from the servers used to respond to the user's request. To activate it, you need to copy the Edge Pulse tag and insert it into the desired HTML pages. In doing so, the Customer declares himself authorized by its users to collect and process the information described above. The data collected may be used by Azion to improve performance and reliability in accessing Edge Applications. AZION IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR: (A) USE THAT WILL BE GIVEN BY THE CUSTOMER TO THE COLLECTED DATA; (B) THE RIGHT THAT THE CUSTOMER HAS TO COLLECT DATA FROM ITS USERS, BECAUSE BY INSERTING THE PULSE TAG IN ITS PAGES WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY AUTHORIZING AZION TO COLLECT THIS INFORMATION. (C) TAG REMOVAL FROM YOUR PAGES IN CASE OF PRODUCT WITHDRAWAL. Azion is committed to not collect any confidential or personal information from its users and also to the correct application of the information collected to constantly improve its delivery algorithms with the clear objective of guaranteeing the best possible experience for those who access our Edge Network. The usage of Edge Pulse must follow the guidelines provided in the product documentation. This way it will guarantee that its execution will be exclusively asynchronous, in other words, it will not impact the loading time and will not interfere in the internal structures of the page where it is inserted. Information related to user navigation will be made available to Customers through Real-Time Events and Data Streaming.

**Image Processor:** an Edge Application module designed to optimize and dynamically manipulate images, and includes the following features: (1) optimization; (2) cutting; (3) resizing; (4) format conversion, and (5) applying filters such as blurring, noise, watermark, and others. The formats supported are JPEG, GIF, PNG, BMP and ICO. Images are manipulated through Query String parameters sent in the request. Image optimization is the process of reducing the image file size, whenever possible, minimizing the quality losses noticeable in the image derived from the optimization process. Images may be delivered in a different file format other than the original, according to users’ access browser, in an effort to improve the delivery (ex: webp). There are no guarantee gains from the optimization process, and customers are tasked with monitoring the average gain from using the service. CUSTOMERS ARE HEREBY ADVISED THAT THE IMAGE OPTIMIZATION PROCESS ALTERS THE CONTENT DELIVERED TO END USERS AND MAY RESULT IN CHANGES TO THE VISUAL QUALITY OF THE IMAGE. AT ANY TIME AND WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE, AZION MAY UPDATE THE OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHMS AND SUCH CHANGES MAY ALTER THE CONTENTS DELIVERED AND THE OPTIMIZATION EFFICIENCY. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Image Processor will be billed considering the Images Processed according to the volumes consumed.

**Intelligent DNS:** designed to provide an authoritative DNS service with support to standard QTYPES such as: A, AAAA, ANAME, CAA, CNAME, MX, NS, PTR, SRV and TXT. To adopt our product, you will need to change your appointment at the domain registrars where you manage your domain so that it starts using Azion name servers. The customer is responsible for renewing their domain names as well as ensuring the correct configuration of their zones, records and responses that they wish to provide through the DNS service. Therefore, Azion is not responsible for any failure to update these records. Azion is authorized to remove zones that are not being used. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Intelligent DNS will be billed considering (a) the total number of Hosted Zones, and (b) the total number of queries answered in a given period (Standard Queries).

**L2 Caching:** designed as an add-on to Edge Caching to provide an additional cache layer between the origin of the Customer and Azion’s Edge, minimizing the volume of requests and traffic to the origin, in cases where it applies. The service has the following features: (1) content cache functionality with TTL equal to or greater than 30 days (2592000 seconds); (2) Real-Time Purge tool; (3) improved edge access to cached content by using persistent hash algorithms. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, L2 Caching will be billed considering (a) Data Transferred and (b) Storage.

**Load Balancer:** an Edge Application module designed to balance customers’ HTTP/HTTPS traffic between origins distributed across multiple datacenter, service providers (multi-cloud) or in the same datacenter. It eliminates or reduces the need for dedicated hardware or software and lowers the impact of local failures on global content availability. Includes access to the following features: (1) Round-Robin balancing, Least Connections and IP Hash; (2) assignment of different weights to origins; (3) primary or backup (standby) server configuration; (4) manipulation of errors and exceptions in case of timeouts when connecting to or getting a response from the origin, or in case the origin’s response error is a supported by Azion. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Load Balancer will be billed considering the Data Transferred according to the volumes consumed.

**Network Layer Protection:** Edge Firewall module designed to control and block access to content and applications directly on Azion's Edge. Access control and blocking can be done by IP address or network (CIDR), geolocation (country of access) and ASN. Azion uses databases from external suppliers to identify geolocation and ASN based on the User's IP address, which may be inaccurate in some situations, with the Customer being responsible for the use of this access restriction functionality. AZION PROVIDES ACCESS CONTROL MECHANISMS BASED ON THE BEST EFFORT, BUT THAT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE UNTRANSPONIBLE RESTRICTIONS AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS. THE CUSTOMER MUST RESTRICT ACCESS BY IP ADDRESS TO OBTAIN THE BEST LEVEL OF CONTROL AND AZION RECOMMENDS THE COMBINATION OF MULTIPLE TECHNIQUES. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Network Layer Protection will be billed considering Requests according to the volumes consumed.

**Origin Shield:** designed as an add-on to the Network Layer Protection module to assist in protecting the Customer's origin, Origin Shield has the following features: (a) access via Real-Time Manager and its API to the complete list of IP/CIDR addresses used by Azion's Products to communicate with the Customer's origins; (b) ensuring that new IP/CIDR addresses added to the Azion network will remain on hold for a period of 7 calendar days, from their inclusion in the Origin Shield listing until they start communicating with the Customer's origins; (c) email notification to the Customer's registered addresses, whenever there is a change in the IP/CIDR addresses used by the Azion network; and (d) discrimination in the History of the Real-Time Manager of the IP/CIDR addresses included and removed in each update of the listing. It is the Customer's responsibility to obtain the list of Origin Shield addresses through the Real-Time Manager or its API and to grant access at their origin, as well as to keep updated the list of email addresses that must receive notification from Azion. Azion will send notification emails, but has no way of guaranteeing that the message will reach the Customer's Mailbox and any error returns from the Customer's email system may result in the message being discarded. It is up to the Customer to keep their Firewall and access policies updated to allow the connection from Azion's servers. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Origin Shield will be billed considering a recurring Origin Shield Fee.

**Real-Time Events:** designed to enable Customers to analyze Azion's Product and Services' events via web interface, searching events in different Data Sources, with different time filters. AZION WILL USE ALL COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS TO RETAIN THE EVENTS FOR 7 DAYS AND MAKE THEM AVAILABLE TO OUR CUSTOMERS WITH A DELAY LOWER THAN 3 MINUTES. IN CASE OF PEAK ACCESS, ATTACKS OR EXTERNAL FACTORS, THE DELAY MAY BE SUPERIOR THAN THE FORESEEN. Except as otherwise provided for in the Customer Agreement or any other documents attached thereto, Real-Time Events will be billed considering (a) Data Gathered; (b) Real-Time Events Queries, according to the volumes consumed.

**Real-Time Metrics:** designed to enable Customers to monitor Azion's Product and Services key performance indicators via web interface or API.

## 2\. Purchase and Billing Options

**On Demand Agreement:** type of purchase through which Customers pay according to their use of the Azion Products and Services. The amount to be paid by Customer for each Product and Service used corresponds to the volume calculated by Azion for the Calculation Metrics in the billing period times its respective Unit Price, according to the Customer Agreement. When Monthly Consumption Ranges have been specified, the Unit Prices of these Consumption Ranges will apply exclusively to the volumes consumed in the respective Consumption Range and generate a progressive discount as Customer’s consumption increases. Under the On-Demand purchase option, Azion reserves the right to remove the account, contents and other Customer data after 12 months of inactivity by Customer.

**Reserved Capacity Agreement:** type of purchase through which Customer commits to a minimum consumption and payment corresponding to Customer’s Reserved Capacity. In case the Reserved Capacity is used in excess according to the Calculation Metric, the excess use will be charged from the Customer by multiplying the volume which exceeded the Reserved Capacity by the respective Unit Price for the On-Demand purchase model or as defined under the Customer Agreement. The volume that goes unused in a month, if any, can not be carried over and used in subsequent months.

**Savings Plan Agreement**\: a more flexible type of purchase in which Customer commits to a fixed amount for a period of 1 (one), 2 (two) or 3 (three) years and is eligible for discounts over On Demand's price list, which are made available on Azion's webpage. These discounts, which are calculated according to payment terms and the volume of the financial commitment, are applied to the following Products, as well as their modules and add-ons: (1) Edge Application, (2) Edge Firewall, (3) Intelligent DNS, (4) Data Streaming and (5) Real-Time Events. By entering into a Savings Plan Agreement, Customer is acquiring service credits for use on Azion Products and Services during the term of the agreement or until total consumption of said credits, whichever happens first. At the depletion of service credits or term of the Savings Plan Agreement, if Customer remains using Azion Products and Services Customer will be subject to On Demand's price list.

**MB:** megabyte(s), 1 MB = 1,000 kB.

**KB ou kB:** kilobyte(s), 1kB = 1,000 bytes.

## 5\. Product Release Stages

The release of new Products or features by Azion is subject to the following stages:

**Experimental**: this is limited to Azion employees and may, by invitation from Azion, be extended to a closed group of Clients, whose participation implies confidentiality on the part of the Client. It is a stage prior to **Preview** for the purpose of testing new Products and features that are still under development (they don’t have to be feature-complete). These features or products may be unstable and undergo changes incompatible with previous versions. There is no SLA during this phase, due to it being a test with limited resource availability. Azion's goal at this stage is to validate functionality and collect feedback from a limited set of Clients or collaborators. At this stage, the Product or feature is generally suitable for use only in the Client's testing environments and is not recommended for production environments. This stage has a variable duration, depending on the development time of each feature or product.

**Preview**: during the Preview stage, the Products or features are ready for broader testing and use by Clients. This stage is often publicly announced by Azion. There are no SLAs during Preview, unless otherwise specified in the terms of a specific release. This stage can last up to 6 months, depending on the specific characteristics and circumstances of each release. Generally, a Preview stage enables use in both testing and production environments, and the Client may be charged for using the Product.

**General Availability**: Products and features in General Availability are open to all Clients, covered by Azion's SLAs when applicable, and are ready for use in production environments, according to these Terms of Service.

**Deprecated**: Products and features that are Deprecated are scheduled to be terminated and removed (End-Of-Life, EOL). All clients must be notified according to the rules of the Client Agreement. There is no SLA for Deprecated Products and features, nor is there a commitment to fix bugs or evolve the features of these Products. Azion can terminate the Product and remove the Client's data on the notified End-Of-Life date, with Clients responsible for copying their data and settings or migrating to another Product, when applicable.
