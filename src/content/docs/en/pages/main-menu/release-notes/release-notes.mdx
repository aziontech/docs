**Faster propagation times**

Increases the speed of the execution and load times when creating, updating, and deleting instances in **Edge Application**, **Edge Firewall**, and **WAF**. This optimization was implemented to shorten the propagation time of changes in application settings on the edge, allowing users to get the latest version of applications in a shorter span of time.

### Edge Application

#### Updates

**Increased Digital Certificates API Rate-Limit**

Avoids request throttling when uploading multiple certificates within a short span of time.

**New fields in Digital Certificates API**

- `azion_information` shows details from the Azion certificate management tool for Let's Encrypt certificates.
- `is_waiting_domain` indicates if the certificate is waiting for the domain's DNS configuration.

### Edge Firewall

#### Bug fixes

- Adding invalid IPv4 and IPv6 formats to **Network Lists** no longer invalidates the network list.

### Azion CLI

**Version 1.1** 

Azion CLI integrated with [Vulcan](https://github.com/aziontech/vulcan), a dev tool for building, running locally, and deploying static javascript-based frameworks, such as: 

- Next
- React
- Vue
- Angular
- Astro
- Hexo
- Vite

#### Updates

**Vulcan version update to 2.1.0**

New version update to Vulcan.

**Login and Logout** 

Adds login and logout commands. For detailed information run:

```bash
azion login -h
azion logout -h
```

**Granular commands** 

Adds granular management of the following products and features:

- Edge Applications
- Edge Functions
- Origins
- Domains
- Rules Engine
- Cache Settings
- Personal Tokens

Usage of the new commands is described in the [Azion CLI documentation](/en/documentation/products/azion-cli/overview/) or via the `azion -h` command.

- [AsyncResource](https://nodejs.org/api/async_hooks.html#class-asyncresource).

- `resourceId`
- `resourceType`
