- **Service-Specific Modules**: offers dedicated modules for Storage, SQL, Purge, and more, allowing for targeted and efficient operations.​

- **Flexible Configuration**: supports environment variable-based configurations and debug modes to cater to various development needs.​

 For detailed installation and usage instructions, refer to the [Azion Lib documentation](/en/documentation/products/azion-lib/overview/) or visit the [NPM package page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/azion).

### Azion Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

#### Azion Config – Enhanced resource support

The `azion.config.js` file, integral to Azion's Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach, now supports a broader range of resources. This enhancement enables more granular and comprehensive configurations, covering:

- **Enhancement on Edge Application - Rules Engine**: configure origin settings with greater flexibility, including support for various origin types and connection policies.​

- **WAF settings**

- **Edge Firewall**: add-ons and Rules Engine.

For a comprehensive overview of the configurable properties, consult the [Azion Config documentation](/en/documentation/devtools/cli/configs/azion-config-js/).

### Azion CLI

### Data Stream

#### Simple Storage Service (S3) connector

Now, when configuring a Simple Storage Service (S3) connector to receive data from Data Stream, file names will be composed of: 

- **Object Key Prefix**: the prefix for the uploaded object's name. Example: `user/logs`.
- **Date and time** the packets are sent in the YYYY/MM/DD/hh/mm/ format.
- **UUID**: a unique request identifier. 

Example: `user/logs/2024/10/12/06/24/37d66e78-c308-4006-9d4d-1c013ed89276`.

This structure simplifies log management and monitoring by enabling precise searches and filtering using the date, time, and UUID.

Read more about the [Account Lockout Policy](/en/documentation/products/accounts/account-lockout-policy/) and [how to configure it](/en/documentation/products/guides/configure-account-lockout-policy/).

### SSO

#### Microsoft Entra as IdP and Automated user provisioning integration

Using **Microsoft Entra Identity Provider (IdP)**, you can authorize single sign-on (SSO) to access other sites or services, such as Azion. Your users can continue using their corporate user identities without remembering a specific password or entering credentials each time they access Azion's platform.

Check the [How to use Microsoft Entra custom SAML app as an IdP for Azion](/en/documentation/products/guides/sso-microsoft-entra-saml/) guide.

Additionally, with Microsoft Entra, you can enable **Automated User Provisioning** to streamline identity and access management by automatically creating, updating, and deleting user accounts across applications based on changes in Microsoft Entra ID. These changes are reflected on Azion's platform users and teams, once the feature is enabled. The automation uses the SCIM protocol, making the provisioning process both scalable and secure.

Read more on this topic in the [documentation](/en/documentation/products/guides/microsoft-entra-automated-user-provisioning/).

### Marketplace

#### Azion Bot Manager Lite 

<Tag severity="info" client:only="vue">Preview</Tag>

The **Azion Bot Manager Lite** integration is now available in the Marketplace, in the **Preview** stage. The integration uses an Edge Firewall's edge function to analyze each request; then, it assigns to the request a score based on a set of rules and behaviors. If the score is equal to or greater than the predetermined threshold, the integration can take actions like denying or dropping the request.

Read more on [How to install Azion Bot Manager Lite from Azion Marketplace](/en/documentation/products/guides/bot-manager-lite/).

### GraphQL

Azion now provides a [Grafana plugin integration](https://github.com/aziontech/grafana-plugin) available for local installation. With it, you can use Grafana's interface to create dashboards and complement your metrics visualization. Your dashboards can be created using GraphQL queries. You can use it to view and create:

- Top X metrics (such as IP addresses or blocked countries).
- Security metrics.
- Customized alerts.
- Specific status codes.

It queries data from [Real-Time Metrics](/en/documentation/products/observe/real-time-metrics/) and [Real-Time Events](/en/documentation/products/observe/real-time-events/), which use the [GraphQL APIs](/en/documentation/devtools/graphql-api/overview/).

For more details, check the documentation on [How to integrate Azion with Grafana](/en/documentation/products/guides/observe/integrate-grafana/) and [How to customize a dashboard with the Azion plugin on Grafana](/en/documentation/products/guides/azion-plugin-grafana-custom-dash/).
