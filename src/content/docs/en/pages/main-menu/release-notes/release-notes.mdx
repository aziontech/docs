### Edge Storage REST API

<Badge variant="accent">Preview</Badge>

**Edge Storage** is a scalable and flexible data storage solution that stores data as discrete objects, each containing its own data, associated metadata, and a unique identifier. This solution now comes equipped with access to the Azion **Edge Storage REST API**, providing high scalability, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness for various unstructured data storage needs.

See more details on the [Edge Storage documentation](/en/documentation/products/azion-cli/overview/), the [API documentation](https://api.azion.com/#af706383-073d-41f0-aba4-ba3540701137), and the following guides:

- [How to create and modify an Azion Edge Storage bucket](/en/documentation/products/guides/create-and-modify-bucket/)
- [How to upload and download objects from an Azion Edge Storage bucket](/en/documentation/products/guides/upload-and-download-objects-from-bucket/)
- [How to use an Azion Edge Storage bucket as the origin of a static edge application](/en/documentation/products/guides/use-bucket-as-origin/)

### Marketplace

#### Fingerprint

The new **Fingerprint** integration enables you to capture device and network data to better identify devices accessing your applications.

This integration includes two features:

- A browser-level script (optional) to capture the browser data and set it as a session cookie.
- An edge function (mandatory) to capture connection-related data as well as the “frontend fingerprint” (created by the browser script) to create the session fingerprint.

The collected data is used to generate a unique identifier and add it as a request header in other integrations and use cases.

Read the [How to install the Fingerprint integration through Azion Marketplace](/en/documentation/products/guides/fingerprint/) guide for more details.

#### Azion Templates
