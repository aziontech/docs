### ALTCHA Redirect Edge Function - Version 1.2.0

We released the version **1.2.0** of the `ALTCHA Redirect` Edge Function. This update enhances your security posture and improves functionality.

### What's New:

- **Open Redirect Protection:**
  - We've introduced a validation process for the after-challenge redirect URL. This ensures that redirects are limited to domains that you specify within the function's JSON Args, fortifying your application against open redirect vulnerabilities.

- **Enhanced Script Injection Safeguards:**
  - Our latest update includes improvements designed to bolster defenses against script injection attempts on the challenge page, offering you more security and reliability.

### Important Information for Current Users:

For those already using the ALTCHA Redirect function, this new version has been deployed to all existing users using the previous one. Please note that while the update is available, you'll need to manually update your instances to use the full benefits of version 1.2.0.

## July 11, 2025

### Bot Manager 1.2.0: New Fingerprinting Engine

Azion released **Bot Manager 1.2.0**, featuring a new fingerprinting engine that enhances device identification accuracy.

#### What's New

- **Advanced Fingerprinting Engine**: The new engine reduces fingerprinting collisions (different devices being assigned the same fingerprint), improving the calibration process for your Bot Manager implementation.

#### Implementation Notes

If you're already using Bot Manager, the function code has been automatically updated to version 1.2.0. However, to activate the new fingerprinting engine, you need to update your JSON Args configuration:

```json
{
  "engine_version": 2
}
```

:::tip[Important]
Activating the new engine may cause temporary changes in bot classification patterns. Your application will require a brief adaptation period to adjust to the enhanced fingerprinting granularity.

Until you update your JSON Args, Bot Manager will continue using the previous fingerprinting engine.
:::

For complete configuration details, please refer to the [Bot Manager documentation](/en/documentation/products/secure/firewall/bot-manager/).

## July 9, 2025

### Edge Functions

Azion Edge functions now supports the cache API, allowing you to control reading and writing from [Edge Cache](https://www.azion.com/en/products/edge-cache/) .

Visit the [Cache API](/en/documentation/runtime/api-reference/cache/) documentation for more details.

## July 2, 2025

### Edge Functions

#### WebSocket Proxy

Azion Edge Functions now supports `WebSocket Proxy`, allowing your Edge Application to act as a full WebSocket server or client and proxy bidirectional traffic to backend services. This unlocks real-time use cases such as chat, multiplayer games, telemetry dashboards, and AI inference streams—all served directly from the Edge for sub-second latency.

**Important**: To activate this feature, enable the Websocket Proxy subscription module on the target Edge Application in the Console or via API. Without this package, Cells cannot accept or proxy WebSocket connections.

**Features Overview**:

- **Server & client modes**: Use `upgradeWebSocket()` for server-side handlers or the standard WebSocket(url) API for outbound connections.
- **Broadcast helpers**: Easily fan-out messages to all connected clients with minimal code.
- **Metrics & logs**: New events (websocket.connection.accepted, message.sent, message.received) are available in Real-Time Metrics and LogStream.
- **Edge Firewall support**: Traffic can be inspected by Edge Firewall rules before upgrade is finalized.

For more details visit the [WebSocket API](/en/documentation/runtime/api-reference/websocket/) documentation.

#### Azion Runtime compatibility

To keep your code portable and future-proof, the Azion Runtime now supports an expanded set of web-standard APIs. These enhancements enable native streaming compression, incremental text processing, precise back-pressure control, and sub-millisecond performance measurement—providing you with advanced tools to maximize throughput and observability for every Edge Function request.

- **Compression Streams API**: `CompressionStream` and `DecompressionStream`
Compress or decompress data on the fly (gzip/deflate) with browser-grade streaming primitives—perfect for log pipelines, API responses, or asset transformation.
- **Streaming Encoding API**: `TextDecoderStream` and `TextEncoderStream`
Incrementally decode or encode UTF-8 (and other encodings) while respecting back-pressure. Ideal for Server-Set Events, chunked JSON, and real-time log tails.
- **Streams API enhancement**: `CountQueuingStrategy`
Build custom streams with count-based high-water marks, keeping memory usage predictable even under bursty workloads.
- **High-resolution timer**:`globalThis.performance.now()`
Access a monotonic, sub-millisecond clock to benchmark cold starts, CPU-bound sections, or end-to-end latency directly inside your function.

These capabilities align Edge Functions with the latest [WinterTC](https://wintertc.org/) specifications, strengthen Node.js compatibility, and give developers richer primitives for building efficient, observable, and standards-compliant applications.

## June 18, 2025

### Edge Functions

JavaScript ES Module Support

Edge Functions now supports JavaScript modules. Making it easier than ever for you to bring your JavaScript applications to the Azion Web Platform.

Visit the [handlers](/en/documentation/products/applications/functions/runtime/api-reference/handlers/) documentation for more details.

## May 15, 2025

### Console

**Simplified GitHub import journey**: Now when importing an application from GitHub there's no longer the need to select application mode, making it easier to deploy your applications.

## May 14, 2025

### Let’s Encrypt HTTP-01 Challenge through API

Azion now offers API-based issuance and renewal of [Let’s Encrypt certificates](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/secure/firewall/certificate-manager/#lets-encrypt-certificate) using the HTTP-01 challenge, providing a streamlined process with no need for DNS TXT records. This offers a straightforward and convenient integration solution, particularly beneficial for customers managing numerous domains and hostnames.

Certificates auto-renew before expiring, removing maintenance windows, and maintaining existing quotas, billing, and permissions. Perfect for ecommerce platforms and hosting providers, this enhancement enables faster onboarding and secures customer sites in minutes without DNS changes.

For more information on these updates, [visit the Digital Certificates documentation](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/secure/firewall/certificate-manager/#lets-encrypt-certificate).

Check the [how-to guide](/en/documentation/products/guides/conditional-access-by-ip-address/) to get more details.

#### User Session Timeout Policy

<Tag severity="info" client:only="vue">Preview</Tag>

The **User Session Timeout** policy allows you to define a **maximum idle time**, ensuring that sessions are automatically terminated after a period of inactivity. It also allows you to define a **maximum session time** to avoid sessions staying open indefinitely.

Check the [reference to understand it better](/en/documentation/products/accounts/user-session-timeout/) and the guide on [how to configure it](/en/documentation/products/guides/configure-user-session-timeout/).

### SSO

#### Microsoft Entra as IdP and Automated user provisioning integration

Using **Microsoft Entra Identity Provider (IdP)**, you can authorize single sign-on (SSO) to access other sites or services, such as Azion. Your users can continue using their corporate user identities without remembering a specific password or entering credentials each time they access Azion's platform.

Check the [How to use Microsoft Entra custom SAML app as an IdP for Azion](/en/documentation/products/guides/sso-microsoft-entra-saml/) guide.

Additionally, with Microsoft Entra, you can enable **Automated User Provisioning** to streamline identity and access management by automatically creating, updating, and deleting user accounts across applications based on changes in Microsoft Entra ID. These changes are reflected on Azion's platform users and teams, once the feature is enabled. The automation uses the SCIM protocol, making the provisioning process both scalable and secure.
