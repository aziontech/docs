#### Azion Integrations

A new integration is available at Azion Marketplace: **Upstash Rate Limiting**. It allows you to control incoming traffic right at the edge of the network, avoiding bottlenecks, managing traffic spikes, and protecting your applications from potential threats.

With this integration, based on an edge function and integrated with the `upstash/ratelimit` library, you can define: **limiting requests**, **window limit**, and a **penalty** configuration that analyzes the validity of each request. 

Find out more on the documentation to [install and configurate Upstash Rate Limiting](/en/documentation/products/guides/upstash-rate-limiting-integration/).
