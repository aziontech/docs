**Faster propagation times**

Increased the speed of the execution and load times when creating, updating, and deleting instances in **Edge Application**, **Edge Firewall**, and **WAF**. This optimization was implemented to shorten the propagation time of changes to the edge.

### Edge Application

#### Updates

**Increased Digital Certificates API Rate-Limit**

Avoids request throttling when uploading multiple certificates within a short span of time.

**New fields in Digital Certificates API**

- `azion_information` shows details from the Azion certificate management tool for Let's Encrypt certificates.
- `is_waiting_domain` indicates if the certificate is waiting for the domain's DNS configuration.

### Edge Firewall

#### Bug fixes

- Adding invalid IPv4 and IPv6 formats to **Network Lists** no longer invalidates the network list.

### Azion CLI

#### Updates

**Login and Logout** 

Adds login and logout commands.

**Granular commands** 

Adds granular management of:

- Edge Applications
- Edge Functions
- Origins
- Domains
- Rules Engine
- Cache Settings
- Personal Tokens


**Version 1.1**

- Next
- React
- Vue
