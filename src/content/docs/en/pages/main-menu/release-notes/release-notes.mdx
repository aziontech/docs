**Faster propagation times**

Increases the speed of the execution and load times when creating, updating, and deleting instances in **Edge Application**, **Edge Firewall**, and **WAF**. This optimization was implemented to shorten the propagation time of changes made on the edge, allowing users to get the latest version of applications in a shorter span of time.

### Edge Application

#### Updates

**Increased Digital Certificates API Rate-Limit**

Avoids request throttling when uploading multiple certificates within a short span of time.

**New fields in Digital Certificates API**

- `azion_information` shows details from the Azion certificate management tool for Let's Encrypt certificates.
- `is_waiting_domain` indicates if the certificate is waiting for the domain's DNS configuration.

### Edge Firewall

#### Bug fixes

- Fixed minor bugs in **Network Lists**.

### Azion CLI

**Version 1.1** 

New version of the Azion CLI integrated with [Vulcan](https://github.com/aziontech/vulcan), a dev tool for building, running locally, and deploying static javascript-based frameworks, such as: 

- Next
- React
- Vue
- Angular
- Astro
- Hexo
- Vite

#### Updates


**Login and Logout** 

Adds login and logout commands. For detailed information run:

```bash
azion login -h
azion logout -h
```

**Management commands** 

Adds management commands for the following products and features:

- Edge Applications
- Edge Functions
- Origins
- Domains
- Rules Engine
