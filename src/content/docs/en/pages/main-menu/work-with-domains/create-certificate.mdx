If your application runs on HTTPS, you'll need to register a certificate with Azion [Digital Certificates](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/digital-certificates/). A TLS digital certificate confirms a website's identity and protects data transfers. It secures financial transactions and any exchange of sensitive information, from login credentials to personal data.

:::note
You can also request that a **Let's Encrypt certificate** be generated for your domain through Azion. The process for requesting a Let's Encrypt certificate is different from custom certificates. See [how to generate a Let's Encrypt certificate](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-generate-a-lets-encrypt-certificate/) for more information.

## Via RTM

1. [Access RTM](https://manager.azion.com).
2. On the upper-left corner of the page, open the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, and then select **Digital Certificates**.
3. To add a new **Custom certificate**, click the **Add certificate** button, then select the **Edge Certificate** option. If your certificate is a CA cert type, select **Trusted CA**.
4. Name your certificate.
5. Keep the option **Upload my certificate and private key** selected.
6. In the field **Certificate**, paste the certificate.
7. For custom certificates, you also need to paste the private key in the **Private key** field.
8. Click the **Save** button.

Now you need to associate your certificate to an Azion domain:

1. On the upper-left corner of the page, open the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, and then select **Domains**.
2. Select the desired domain.
3. In **Edge Certificate**, select the certificate you created in the previous steps.
4. Make sure the CNAMEs listed in the **CNAME** field are the same as the issued certificate for your custom domain.
5. Click the **Save** button.
6. Wait a couple of minutes for the changes to propagate. 

You can access your HTTPS application and check the security settings using your browser or run the following OpenSSL command, replacing `yourdomain.com` with one of the CNAMEs of the domain:

```bash
openssl s_client -showcerts -connect yourdomain.com:443
```

## Via API

### Option 1: Upload custom certificate

1. Acquire the X.509 certificate from a CA.
2. Replace any line breaks with `\n`, including for the begin and end markers, to turn the certificate into a string.
3. Do the same to the private key.
4. Run the following cURL command in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and adding your certificate and private key to the fields:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/digital_certificates' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--data '{
    "name": "CERT yourdomain.com",
    "certificate": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n<your_private_key>\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----",
    "private_key": "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n<your_private_key>\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"
}'
```

  | Key | Description |
  | --- | --- |
  | `name` | Sets the string in the value as a name of the certificate entry with Azion. |
  | `certificate` | Takes your certificate as a value. Must be a continuous string. |
  | `private_key` | Takes your private key as a value. Must be a continuous string. |

Upon uploading your custom certificate, you'll receive a successful response:

```json
{
    "results": {
        "id": <digital_certificate_id>,
        "name": "CERT yourdomain.com",
        "issuer": "",
        "subject_name": [],
        "validity": "2028-03-24 20:09:00-03:00",
        "status": "Active",
        "certificate_type": "edge_certificate",
        "managed": false
    }
}
```

### Option 2: Upload Trusted CA

1. Acquire a trusted certificate signed by your CA.
2. Replace any line breaks with `\n`, including for the begin and end markers, to turn the certificate into a string.
3. Run the following cURL command in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and adding your certificate and to the fields:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/digital_certificates' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "name": "TCA yourdomain.com",
    "certificate": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\n<your_trusted_ca_certificate>\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----",
    "certificate_type": "trusted_ca_certificate"
}'
```

  | Key | Description |
  | --- | --- |
  | `name` | Sets the string in the value as a name of the certificate entry with Azion. |
  | `certificate` | Takes your certificate as a value. Must be a continuous string. |
  | `certificate_type` | When set to `trusted_ca_certificate`, the endpoint no longer requires a private key entry. |

Upon uploading your Trusted CA, you'll receive a successful response:

```json
{
    "results": {
        "id": <digital_certificate_id>,
        "name": "TCA yourdomain.com",
        "issuer": "",
        "subject_name": [],
        "validity": "2028-03-24 20:09:00-03:00",
        "status": "Active",
        "certificate_type": "trusted_ca_certificate",
        "managed": false
    }
}
```

### Associate certificate to domain

1. Run the following `GET` request to retrieve your domain's id:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/domains' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
```

2. You'll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
    ...
    "results": [
        {
            "id": <domain_id>,
            "name": "My Domain",
            "cnames": [],
            "cname_access_only": true,
            "digital_certificate_id": null,
            "edge_application_id": <edge_application_id>,
            "is_active": true,
            "domain_name": "xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net"
        }
    ]
}
```

3. Locate the domain you wish to associate to the certificate and copy the `domain_id` value received in the response.
4. Run a `PATCH` request, adding the `domain_id` as a path, to update the `digital_certificate_id` field with the id you received in the creation process:

:::note[Optional]
As shown in the example below, if you didn't update the CNAME field with your custom domain yet, make sure to add the host and any common names for the application that are protected by the certificate. This will be useful when you later [point your domain](/en/documentation/products/guides/point-domain-to-azion/) or [migrate your NS resolution](/en/documentation/products/guides/migrate-ns-to-azion/) to Azion.
:::

```bash
curl --location --request PATCH 'https://api.azionapi.net/domains/<domain_id>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "digital_certificate_id": <digital_certificate_id>,
    "cnames": [
        "yourdomain.com"
    ]
}'
```

5. You should receive a response with the updated data.
6. Wait a couple of minutes for the changes to propagate. Then, access your HTTPS application and check the security settings using your browser or run the following OpenSSL command, replacing `yourdomain.com` with one of the CNAMEs of the domain:

```bash
openssl s_client -showcerts -connect yourdomain.com:443
```
