To point your traffic to Azion, you must associate your custom domain CNAME entries to your Azion domain address through [Domains](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/domains/).

:::note
This process will require you to associate a CNAME record to your domain. See [Migrate your DNS to Azion](/en/documentation/products/guides/migrate-ns-to-azion/) for more information on how to associate an ANAME record.
:::

## Verify custom domain

### Via RTM

To point your Azion domain to a custom domain, you need to list the CNAMEs you want to configure for the application:

1. [Access RTM](https://manager.azion.com).
2. On the upper-left corner of the page, open the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, and then select **Domain**.
3. Click the domain you want to associate your custom domain to.
4. In the **CNAME** field, add the custom domains for the application. For example: `yourdomain.com`.
5. Disable the **CNAME access only** switch.
5. Click the **Save** button.

Now your Azion domain is ready to be associated to a custom domain on your DNS provider.

### Via API

1. Run the following `GET` request to retrieve your domain's ID, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/):

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/domains?order_by=name&sort=asc&page=1&page_size=10' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
```

2. You'll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
    ...
    "results": [
        {
            "id": <domain_id>,
            "name": "yourdomain.com CA1 DC-yourdomain.com",
            "cnames": [],
            "cname_access_only": true,
            "digital_certificate_id": <digital_certificate_id>,
            "edge_application_id": <edge_application_id>,
            "is_active": true,
            "domain_name": "xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net"
        }
    ]
}
```

3. Locate the domain you wish to link to the custom domain and copy the `domain_id` value received in the response.
4. Run a `PATCH` request, , replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and adding the `domain_id` as a path, to update the `cnames` field with the domains you wish to configure:

```bash
curl --location --request PATCH 'https://api.azionapi.net/domains/<domain_id>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "cnames": [
        "yourdomain.com",
        "*.yourdomain.com"
    ]
}'
```

  | Key | Description |
  | --- | --- |
  | `cnames` | Accepts a list of CNAMEs for the domains as values. For example, `["*.yourdomain.com", "*.yourdomain.org"]`. |

:::tip
If your application uses HTTPS, you might want to combine this process with the [association of a digital certificate](/en/documentation/products/guides/create-a-digital-certificate/) to your custom domain.
:::

5. You should receive a response with the updated data.

## Modify domain records

Once you have a domain, you need to access your DNS provider and locate the **records management** area. There, you can modify every entry associated with your domain. The entry you need to associate your Azion domain to is a **CNAME** record.

:::note
Some services *don't allow you* to change your ANAME resolution directly, meaning you cannot directly point `yourdomain.org` to Azion this way. See how to [migrate your NS to Azion](/en/documentation/products/guides/migrate-ns-to-azion/).
:::

At your DNS provider, you can add or modify a `www` CNAME record and associate it to your edge application. See the documentation on how to edit domain records of some of the most popular DNS providers below:

- [AWS Route53](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/getting-started/hands-on/get-a-domain/)
- [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/help/manage-dns-records-680)
- [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/767/10/how-to-change-dns-for-a-domain/)

To configure your DNS records:

1. Sign in to your DNS provider.
2. Choose your domain.
3. Locate the page where you can modify DNS records for your domain.
4. Create or edit the `www` CNAME record of your domain by filling out the information:

| Name | Value | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `www` | `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net` | CNAME |

:::tip
Some providers allow you to add a wildcard (`*`) subdomain instead of a specific subdomain to cover all scenarios. This way, you won't need to specify that `www.yourdomain.com` and `blog.yourdomain.com` point to the same edge application address.
:::

5. Don't forget to save your settings.

Note that there might be a delay in propagation time when you access your application. If that's the case, [you can run the dig command](/en/documentation/products/guides/run-the-dig-command/) in your terminal to check the DNS records of your edge node. For example:

```bash
dig +short yourdomain.org @200.0.0.0
```

Once the changes have propagated, you'll be able to access your edge application through your custom domain.
