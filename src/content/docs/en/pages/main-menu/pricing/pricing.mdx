## Build

### Edge Application

Build serverless applications and run them anywhere: Azion's—operated network edge, remote-devices, on-premises, and multi-cloud, on an easy and simple way.

<LinkButton link="https://www.azion.com/en/products/edge-application/" label="Access product details" severity="secondary" />

:::note[Tiered Cache]
An additional cache layer that reduces traffic to your point of origin while improving performance and availability.

**Tiered Cache** is an optional item. When used, **Total Data Transferred** will be calculated as the sum of **Edge Application** traffic and **Tiered Cache** traffic.

#### Domains (unitary)

| Service Plan | Included domains |
| -------- | ----- |
| Developer | Up to 10 domains |
| Business | Up to 50 domains |
| Enterprise | Up to 200 domains |
| Mission Critical | Up to 200 domains |
| Additional domains | 5 USD per domain |

#### Price example
If your applications received 750 million requests from the United States in 1 month, consuming a total traffic of 30 TB, and you were within the limit of 1,000 purges in that month, the price will be calculated as follows:

|  | |
| :--- | ---: |
| **Total Data Transferred**<br/>The first 10 TB of traffic is priced at 0.085 USD per GB, so 10,000 x 0.085 USD | 850 USD | 
| The next 20 TB of traffic is priced at 0.080 USD per GB, so 20,000 x 0.080 USD | 1,600 USD | 
| In this example, the price for this month will be | 2,450 USD | 
| The charge is for every 10,000 requests, at a unit price of 0.009 USD, so (750,000,000 / 10,000) x 0.009 USD | 675 USD | 
| **Total charges**<br/>According to this simulation, the total amount to be paid this month will be | **3,125 USD** |

#### Price example

If your **Application Accelerator** enabled application generated 30 TB of data transferred in Brazil in 1 month, the price will be calculated as follows:

| | |
| :--- | ---: |
| The first 10 TB of traffic is priced at 0.040 USD per GB, so 10,000 x 0.040 USD | 400 USD | 
| The next 20 TB of traffic is priced at 0.035 USD per GB, so 20,000 x 0.035 USD | 700 USD | 
| **Total charges**<br/>According to this simulation, the total amount to be paid this month will be | **1,100 USD** | 

### Edge Cache

#### Price example

If your applications deliver 600 million images in the United States in a month, and the content offload is 95% (for example, 95% of your content is delivered from the cache without fetching it from your point of origin), this means that 30 million images will be processed by **Image Processor**.

| | |
| :--- | ---: |
| The first 10 million images processed will be priced at 1.60 USD for every 10,000 images, for example: (10,000,000 / 10,000) x 1.60 USD | 1,600 USD | 
| The next 20 million images processed will be priced at 1.28 USD for every 10,000 images, for example: (20,000,000 / 10,000) x 1.28 USD | 2,560 USD |

| | |
| :--- | ---: |
| The first billion requests will be priced at 0.005 USD for every 10,000 requests. Thus, (1,000,000,000 / 10,000) x 0.005 USD | 500 USD | 
| The next 2 billion requests will be priced at 0.004 USD. Thus, (2,000,000,000 / 10,000) x 0.004 USD | 800 USD |

| **Hosted Zones**<br/>The first 25 zones are priced at a unit price of 25 USD, thus | 625 USD | 
| The remaining 5 zones are priced at a unit price of 15 USD, thus | 75 USD | 
| In this example, the 30 zones will cost| 700 USD |
| **Standard Queries**<br/>The first billion queries will be priced at 0.85 USD per million. Therefore (1,000,000,000 / 1,000,000) x 0.85 USD | 850 USD |

| | |
| :--- | ---: |
| **Data Stream Requests**<br/>The first 1 billion requests are priced at 0.024 USD per 10,000 requests, so (1,000,000,000 / 10,000) x 0.024 USD | 2,400 USD | 
| The next 2 billion requests are priced at 0.010 USD per 10,000 requests, so (2,000,000,000/ 10,000) x 0.010 USD | 2,000 USD |
