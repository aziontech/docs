#### Price example
If your applications received 750 million requests from the United States in 1 month, consuming a total traffic of 30 TB, and you were within the limit of 1,000 purges in that month, the price will be calculated as follows:

|  | |
| :--- | ---: |
| **Total Data Transferred**<br/>The first 10 TB of traffic is priced at 0.085 USD per GB, so 10,000 x 0.085 USD | 850 USD | 
| The next 20 TB of traffic is priced at 0.080 USD per GB, so 20,000 x 0.080 USD | 1,600 USD | 
| In this example, the price for this month will be | 2,450 USD | 
| The charge is for every 10,000 requests, at a unit price of 0.009 USD, so (750,000,000 / 10,000) x 0.009 USD | 675 USD | 
| **Total charges**<br/>According to this simulation, the total amount to be paid this month will be | **3,125 USD** | 

### Application Accelerator

#### Price example

If your **Application Accelerator** enabled application generated 30 TB of data transferred in Brazil in 1 month, the price will be calculated as follows:

| | |
| :--- | ---: |
| The first 10 TB of traffic is priced at 0.040 USD per GB, so 10,000 x 0.040 USD | 400 USD | 
| The next 20 TB of traffic is priced at 0.035 USD per GB, so 20,000 x 0.035 USD | 700 USD | 
| **Total charges**<br/>According to this simulation, the total amount to be paid this month will be | **1,100 USD** | 

### Edge Cache

  product_slug="edge_functions"
  metric_slug="invocations"
/>

#### Price example

If your applications invoke an edge function in the United States 5 million times in a month, and each invocation runs within 30 milliseconds, you'll be billed as follows:

| | |

#### Price example

If your applications deliver 600 million images in the United States in a month, and the content offload is 95% (for example, 95% of your content is delivered from the cache without fetching it from your point of origin), this means that 30 million images will be processed by **Image Processor**.

| | |
| :--- | ---: |
| The first 10 million images processed will be priced at 1.60 USD for every 10,000 images, for example: (10,000,000 / 10,000) x 1.60 USD | 1,600 USD | 
| The next 20 million images processed will be priced at 1.28 USD for every 10,000 images, for example: (20,000,000 / 10,000) x 1.28 USD | 2,560 USD | 
| **Total charges**<br/>According to this simulation, the total amount to be paid in this month will be | **4,160 USD** |

| | |
| :--- | ---: |
| The first billion requests will be priced at 0.005 USD for every 10,000 requests. Thus, (1,000,000,000 / 10,000) x 0.005 USD | 500 USD |

#### Price example

| | |
| :--- | ---: |
| The first billion requests will be priced at 0.025 USD for each 10,000 requests. Thus, (1,000,000,000 / 10,000) x 0.025 USD | 2,500 USD | 
| The next 2 billion requests will be priced at 0.024 USD. Thus, (2,000,000,000 / 10,000) x 0.024 USD | 4,800 USD | 
| **Total charges**<br/>According to this simulation, the total amount to be paid in this month will be | **7,300 USD** |

  lang="en"
  metric='Standard Queries | per million'
  billing={[

  ]}
  product_slug="intelligent_dns"
  metric_slug="idns_queries"

#### Price example

If you have hosted 30 zones in **Edge DNS** and received 1.5 billion queries in a month, the value will be calculated as follows:

| | |
| :--- | ---: |
| **Hosted Zones**<br/>The first 25 zones are priced at a unit price of 25 USD, thus | 625 USD | 
| The remaining 5 zones are priced at a unit price of 15 USD, thus | 75 USD | 
| In this example, the 30 zones will cost| 700 USD |
| **Standard Queries**<br/>The first billion queries will be priced at 0.85 USD per million. Therefore (1,000,000,000 / 1,000,000) x 0.85 USD | 850 USD | 
| The remaining 500 million will be priced at 0.40 USD per million. So 500 x 0.40 USD | 200 USD |

#### Price example

If you had 3 billion **Data Stream** requests and streamed 25 TB of data, the value would be calculated as follows:

| | |
| :--- | ---: |
| **Data Stream Requests**<br/>The first 1 billion requests are priced at 0.024 USD per 10,000 requests, so (1,000,000,000 / 10,000) x 0.024 USD | 2,400 USD | 
| The next 2 billion requests are priced at 0.010 USD per 10,000 requests, so (2,000,000,000/ 10,000) x 0.010 USD | 2,000 USD | 
| In this example, the calculated value will be | 4,400 USD |
| **Data Streamed**<br/>The first 10TB will be priced at 0.085 USD per GB, so 10,000 x 0.085 USD | 850 USD | 
| The next 15TB will be priced at 0.080 USD per GB, so 15,000 x 0.080 USD | 1,200 USD | 
| In this example, the calculated value will be | 2,050 USD | 
| **Total charges**<br/>According to this simulation, the total amount to be paid in this month will be | **6,450 USD** |

<LinkButton link="https://www.azion.com/en/products/real-time-events/" label="Access product details" severity="secondary" />

| Data Gathered | Price per GB |
| --- | ----------- |
| First 400<br/>GB/month | 1.50 USD |
| Next 600<br/>GB/month | 1.20 USD |
| Over 1<br/>TB/month | 0.60 USD |

| Queries | Unitary |
| --- | ----------- |
| First 1,000<br/>queries/month | Included |
| Over 1,000<br/>queries/month | 0.10 USD |

#### Price example

If your applications have 300 TB of traffic in a month, most of that volume is data, such as payload, while other traffic is metadata, such as HTTP headers, the request made, status, or user information. Real-Time Events collects some of the metadata, which are made available for your query. The metadata collected represents on average *0.2% of your traffic*.

| | |
| :--- | ---: |
| In this simulation, 600 GB (300 TB x 0.2%) will be gathered. |  | 
| The first 400 GB will be charged at a unit price of 1.50 USD, so 400 x 1.50 USD | 600 USD | 
| The remaining 200 GB will be charged at a unit price of 1.20 USD, so 200 x 1.20 USD | 240 USD |
| **Total charges**<br/>Considering that the limit of 1,000 queries isn't exceeded, the total price calculated in this simulation will be | **840 USD** |

:::note[Queries]
This is the total number of **Real-Time Events** queries. The first 1,000 queries in a month are included for all clients. When exceeding this volume, you'll be charged 0.10 USD per query.
