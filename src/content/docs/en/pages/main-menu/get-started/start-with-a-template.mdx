Building an edge application is the first step to start using **Azion Edge Platform**. This documentation presents the options to build and deploy a new application, using an [Azion Template]().

You have these ways to start building with a template:

<Button href="/en/documentation/products/use-a-template-via-rtm/" text="Via Real-Time Manager" variant="secondary"> 

</Button>

<br />

<Button href="/en/documentation/products/azion-cli/create-application/" text="Via Azion CLI" variant="secondary"> 

</Button>

Once you've built your edge application with the preferred method, you can come back to follow your journey and [Go live with Azion](/en/documentation/products/go-live-with-azion/).
