Building an edge application is the first step to start using **Azion Edge Platform**. This documentation presents the options to build and deploy a new application, using an [Azion Template](/en/documentation/products/marketplace/templates/).

You have these ways to start building with a template:

<LinkButton link="/en/documentation/products/use-a-template-via-azion-console/" label="Via Azion Console" severity="secondary" />
<LinkButton link="/en/documentation/products/azion-cli/create-application/" label="Via Azion CLI" severity="secondary" /> 



Once you've built your edge application with the preferred method, you can come back to follow your journey and [Go live with Azion](/en/documentation/products/go-live-with-azion/).
