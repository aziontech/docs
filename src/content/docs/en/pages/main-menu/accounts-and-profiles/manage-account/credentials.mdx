You can generate credentials to use and authenticate services. Follow these steps:

1. Access [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. Access the **Credentials** page on the **Account menu** on the top-right corner, represented by the avatar.
3. Click the **Add Credential** button.
4. Choose a name for your credential.
5. Describe how or by whom the credential will be used in the **Description** field in **Settings**.
- Example: `Credential used for Edge Nodes registration`.
6. Click the **Save** button.

The token will be generated after the credential is saved.

When clicking on the created credential on the **Credentials** page, you can:

- Copy the generated token.
- Delete your credential.
- Edit your credential. You can update your credential's *name*, *description*, and *status* (active/inactive).
