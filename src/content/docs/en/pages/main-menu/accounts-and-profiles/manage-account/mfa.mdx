## Enabling MFA

You can enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) when creating a new user, to set it up to active users, or to secure access to your account.

2. Click the **Account Menu** on the top-right corner, represented by the avatar, and select **User Preferences**.
3. Enable the MFA switch.
4. Click **Save** to finish the process.

To enable MFA to existing users:

1. Access [RTM](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. Click the **Account Menu** on the top-right corner, represented by the avatar, and select **Users Management**.
3. Select the desired user to access their profile.

## Setting up an MFA mobile application 

To install an authenticator application on your mobile phone, consult your operational system's app store (such as iOS' App Store or Android's Google Play). You can use Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator applications, for instance.

Once you've downloaded the application and logged in, follow these steps to connect the Azion's account to your chosen authenticator application:

1. Locate and click the **+** button.
2. Select the account type you're going to add. The camera will start.
3. Scan the QR code that appears when you log into **RTM**.
4. Type the six-digit code and click **Verify Code**.

With MFA, you must have access to your mobile phone to log into RTM and provide the 6-digit code.

## Enforcing MFA usage for all users of an account

To enforce MFA for all users linked to an account:

1. [Access RTM](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. Click the **Account Menu** on the top right-right corner, represented by the avatar, and select **Account Settings**.
3. Under **Authentication Settings**, enable the **Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication** switch.
- When you enable this item, MFA will be mandatory for all users of the account.
4. Click **Save** to finish the process.

To disable this setting, follow the steps above, disable the **Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication** switch, and click **Save**.

## Logging in to Real-Time Manager using MFA

To log in to RTM with Multi-Factor Authentication activated:

## Resetting MFA 

In case of loss or theft of your mobile phone, you won't be able to log in to RTM unless an **Account owner** resets the MFA function.

:::note
MFA can be reset only if the MFA enforcement isn't mandatory for the account's users.
:::

To do so, you can ask for an **Account owner** user to deactivate your MFA function. In case you're an **Account owner**:

1. Access [RTM](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. Click the **Account Menu** on the top-right corner, represented by the avatar, and select **Users Management**.
3. Select the desired user to access their profile.
4. Disable the MFA switch.
5. Click **Save** to finish the process.

If you're the only **Account owner** within the account, it's necessary to contact the [support team](https://tickets.azion.com/en/support/login) to reset the MFA.
