## Before you begin

Before you migrate applications to Azion, there are two major points:

1. **Origin address**: can be an object storage service, either on-premises or in the cloud. The origin takes the form of an URL, an IPv4 or IPv6 address.
2. **Delivery domain**: takes the form of a [custom domain](/en/documentation/products/guides/configure-a-domain/). 

### Step 1: Create an Edge Application 

You can start by creating an Edge Application using a basic template. See the [list of available templates](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/#azion-templates).

### Step 2: Test locally 

Before fully deploying the application, it is recommended to conduct local tests to ensure everything is working correctly. This step helps to identify and address any misconfigurations or issues.

### Step 3: Point the domain 

Finally, you can point your custom domain to the Azion domain. Check out the [Azion's Domain Turnover Documentation](https://docs.azion.com) for detailed steps. Double-check each step to make sure your migration to Azion is smooth.The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements for migrating an application to Azion. This migration guide is specifically written for developers who are leveraging the Developer plan.

The process of migrating an application to Azion involves a series of steps, which are detailed below.



### Step 4: Domain Turnover 

As the final step, you will execute a domain turnover. Refer to the [Azion's Domain Turnover Documentation](https://docs.azion.com) for a comprehensive guide on how to re-point your domain to Azion's servers.

This guide has provided steps to migrate your application to Azion, but it's recommended to double-check each step for a smooth and successful transition.
