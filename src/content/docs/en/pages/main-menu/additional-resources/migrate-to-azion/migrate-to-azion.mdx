This guide provides a step-by-step path for migrating existing applications to Azion. It outlines the necessary requirements and details the steps for a successful transfer of applications from other services to the edge.

## Before you begin

Before you migrate applications to Azion, there are two major variables that must exist:

1. **Origin address**: the source server of the application. This entry point to the edge takes the form of either a host, an IPv4, or an IPv6 address of a storage service or an existing application.

2. **Delivery domain**: the target domain of the application. This output takes the form of an Azion domain, which can be pointed to a custom domain.

Most applications need an origin from which Azion retrieves the content and code that make them up. That application passes through Azion edge nodes for it to be delivered to users through a domain address.

## Step 1: Create an edge application 

You can start by creating an edge application using a basic template. A recommended option is the [Hello World](/en/documentation/products/guides/hello-world-template/) template, which uses **Edge Functions** to run a simple function on the edge.

See the [full list of available templates](/en/documentation/products/guides/#azion-templates).

## Step 2: Test locally 

Before fully deploying the application, the recommendation is to [stage your application through the hosts file](/en/documentation/products/guides/stage-edge-application-through-hosts-file/) to ensure everything is working correctly. This step helps to identify and address any misconfigurations or issues caused by the migration.

## Step 3: Point the domain 

The final step to fully migrate your application to Azion is to point your custom domain to the Azion's edge application. By doing so, you allow users to access your edge application through its domain, reducing latency and processing costs on the origin.
