Azion Marketplace offers you integrations that you can use to improve, compose, or customize your applications. As a digital catalog, it allows developers to implement integrations that meet their requirements, offering resources developed by Azion's specialized teams or third-party sellers and partners using [Azion Marketplace](/en/documentation/products/marketplace/) as a platform to distribute their products.

By being executed on the edge, these integrations, based on edge functions, offer a faster response time, and lower latency, resulting in better performance and user experience. Additionally, they use edge resources and capabilities to enforce security and compliance requirements.

## How Azion Integrations work

**Azion Integrations** are based on edge functions that can be triggered by specific events and execute specific tasks. The functions are composed of **Code** and **Args**, where Code defines the core behavior and can’t be modified, and Args are the parameters to be used with the integration. Usually, the Args can be customized according to your needs.

This approach provides more flexibility to create new integrations to attend to different use cases, as well as allows users to adapt them to any particular demand.

The integrations are organized into various categories, making it easy to explore the available options:

- **Security**: authenticate users, validate input data, route requests, define rate limiting, and scan and filter content to protect your applications from malicious attacks.
- **Performance**: reduce the load on your servers, minimize network latency, and accelerate content delivery, providing an improved experience for users.
- **Database**: manage your databases in a smooth way and generate dynamic content as demanded, such as personalized recommendations or geolocalized messages, based on user preferences or real-time data.
- **Edge AI**: implement facial recognition and ID matching tools, and accelerate and automate processes with state-of-the-art integrations.

## Main configurations and characteristics

### User-friendly set up

You can install and instantiate the integration in a few steps through [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com/) and quickly improve your applications. 

### Edge capabilities

Based on edge functions, these integrations run on the **Azion Edge Platform**, taking advantage of a distributed network to accelerate delivery and a safer environment. Being part of Azion's platform, you can also benefit from using other [Azion products](/en/documentation/). 

### Existing application optimization

Integrations help to follow the composability principle, providing modular and reusable components or services that can be easily integrated into your applications. This way, you enhance and update your existing applications expanding their functionalities and scope without the need to develop from zero.

### Easy management

Customers can manage all the settings related to any given application, as well as update and customize the Args of the functions via Azion Console, when possible.

## Types of integrations

In Azion Marketplace, you find integrations that run edge functions in two ways: by using [Edge Firewall](#edge-firewall-functions) or by using [Edge Application](#edge-application-functions). The Edge Firewall functions are focused on network security, authentication, and traffic control, while Edge Application functions are the best fit to process data or run services on the edge, closer to the user.

After accessing Azion Marketplace, you can find a suitable integration for your needs and start the installation process. The details depend on the type of function of the integration you choose.

:::tip
Check [Azion’s guides page](/en/documentation/products/guides/#marketplace) for more details on the installation for each integration.
:::

### Edge Application functions

By using an edge application, these integrations run tasks and services on the edge, closer to the user. This type of integration is recommended for scenarios where it’s necessary to guarantee low latency, fast real-time data processing, and optimized bandwidth usage. In this matter, Azion Marketplace provides integrations related to databases, massive redirects, a/b testing, and signed cookies, among others.

The installation of this type of integration requires completing certain steps:

1. **Integration installation**: get and install the integration through Azion Marketplace.
2. **Integration configuration**: select the edge application you want to use with the integration.
3. **Integration instantiation**: add a function and set the Args.
4. **Rules Engine setup**: create a new rule, with the criteria and behavior to apply to your function.

:::note
Certain integrations may have dependencies and require more actions. Visit [Azion’s guides page](/en/documentation/products/guides/#marketplace) to check the step-by-step process for each integration.
:::

#### Main use cases

Integrations based on Edge Application functions cover the following scenarios and use cases:

- **Testing and validation**: evaluate user experience or complete a quick system validation to ensure adequate behaviors.

| Integration | Description |
|---|---|
| [A/B tests](/en/documentation/products/guides/ab-testing-marketplace/) | Use A/B tests to validate certain addresses, interfaces, or even workflows. |
| [Hello World](/en/documentation/products/guides/hello-world/) | Test how the edge technology works, by displaying a message, `Hello World`, on your browser using an edge application. |
| [Send messages to a queue](/en/documentation/products/guides/send-messages-to-a-queue/) | Add messages to the back of the queue. Messages can be sent asynchronously and processed by the receiving component later, allowing for easy communication between different parts of a system. |

- **Content segmentation and personalization**: implement dynamic strategies to deliver your content while offering personalized and secure experiences. 

| Integration | Description |
|---|---|
| [Content Targeting](/en/documentation/products/guides/content-targeting-integration/) | Manipulate cookies and headers for flexible usage logic. |
| [Signed Cookies](/en/documentation/products/guides/signed-cookies/) | Implement this type of cookie that has an extra layer of security. |

### Edge Firewall functions

These functions take advantage of the features of Edge Firewall and Rules Engine to protect your network, applications, and resources from unauthorized access, malicious traffic, cyberattacks, bad bots, and other security threats. Some of the integrations in this category include bot management, hCaptcha, reCaptcha, secure tokens, and scheduled blocking, among others.

The installation of this type of integration requires completing certain steps:

1. **Integration installation**: get and install the integration through Azion Marketplace.
2. **Edge Firewall rule setup**: add a Rule Set and enable Edge Functions.
3. **Edge Firewall function setup**: add a function and set the Args.
4. **Edge Firewall Rules Engine configuration**: create a new rule, with the criteria and behavior to apply to your function.

:::note
Certain integrations may have dependencies and require more actions. Visit [Azion’s guides page](/en/documentation/products/guides/#marketplace) to check the step-by-step process for each integration.

## Integrations' update process

The integrations presented within the Marketplace aren't static. Azion and Azion's partners can update them when they launch new features. Thus, the recommendation is always to have the most updated integration.

To make sure that you're running the latest version of the integration, go to the [How to update an integration](/en/documentation/products/marketplace/update-an-integration/) guide and check how to complete this process.
