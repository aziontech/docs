Azion **Templates** are pre-built and pre-configured projects designed to quickly create and deploy new edge applications attending to a variety of use cases. These templates work seamlessly with **Azion Edge Platform**, enabling developers to take advantage of the [benefits of edge computing](https://youtu.be/ZBC8h-0l1FQ?feature=shared) for their applications, such as low latency, global delivery, enhanced security, and a high level of performance.

By using templates, you also obtain accelerated development, more consistency, implementation of best practices, scalability, improved workflow, and more time to innovate and boost your user experience.

## How Azion Templates work

Azion Templates are available via [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com), Azion's configuration interface. Customers can select the desired template, complete the setup, and start the deployment.

The execution of these templates involves:

- **Edge application creation**: an edge application is set up on Azion's platform, enabling the management of all your settings.
- **Domain setup**: a new Azion domain is configured to provide access to your edge application. You can also [add a custom domain](/en/documentation/products/guides/configure-a-domain/) to this edge application.
- **Configurations setup**: defined according to the use case, to ensure optimal performance and security.
- **Edge function creation**: some cases include the creation of an edge function, providing the arguments with the custom logic and the required dependencies.
- **GitHub repository creation**: this repository contains all the files related to the template, including the edge function, an action to enable continuous deployment workflow, and trackable deployment history. 

Once the template is deployed, you also have full control over customizing all settings at any time you need.

:::caution[warning]
To guarantee the optimal performance of certain templates, some Azion products must be activated in your account and you must enable them separately via Azion Console. If these products are activated, the execution of the templates could generate usage-related costs. Check the [guides by template](/en/documentation/products/guides/#azion-templates) and the [pricing page](/en/documentation/products/pricing/) for more information.

## Main configurations and characteristics

### User-friendly set up

After selecting a template that matches your needs, you only have to complete a few steps to quickly deploy the template to the edge through Azion Console, Azion's configuration interface. With this, you don't need to start from scratch and can have a project running in a few minutes.

:::note
Some templates based on frameworks can be initiated via Azion CLI. To obtain more information go to [CLI documentation](/en/documentation/products/azion-cli/create-application/).
:::

### Automation

Azion Templates enable the automation of creating new edge applications, reducing development errors, saving time, ensuring consistency, and offering the opportunity to test edge capabilities.

After deployment, an edge application, an edge function, and a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aziontech/azion-samples/tree/dev/templates) are created, including some initial configurations to run the template. This architecture allows an efficient management and continuous deployment workflow.

### Edge capabilities

By using these templates, the applications run on the Azion Edge Platform, taking advantage of a distributed network to accelerate delivery and a use safer environment. Being part of the Azion's platform, you can also benefit from using other [Azion products](/en/documentation/) to enhance your applications. 

### Easy management

You can update and customize your application settings via Azion Console as well as add a custom domain for users to access your edge application through it. Additionally, the GitHub repository includes a GitHub Action that you're able to activate and enable continuous deployment and integration between your repository and Azion's platform. 

### Third-party integration

Some templates work with third-party tools to provide a more comprehensive and modern solution. Using this type of template will require compliance with certain requirements such as creating an account or initial setup. In some cases, this integration could generate cost by usage.
