**Azion Integrations** allows you to improve, compose, or customize your applications. These integrations are based on edge functions and are executed on the edge. This documentation will guide you to install an integration in an existing application.

Considering Azion Marketplace has integrations that run edge functions in two ways, you'll need to proceed according to the type of integration you want to install:

- [Application integrations](#edge-application-integrations)
- [Firewall integrations](#edge-firewall-integrations)

## Application integrations

These integrations run tasks and services on the edge, closer to the user, employing an *existing* application.

:::tip
To build a new application, go to the [Build](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/build-an-application/) journey for more details on this topic.

To install and instantiate this type of integration, follow the next steps.

### Getting the integration

Access [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com) and go to **Marketplace** to select the integration you want to install.

After selecting the integration, click the **Get It Now** button, at the bottom-right corner of the page, and a successful message appears to confirm your integration is installed.

Once you’ve gotten your integration, you’ll have to select an application to use the integration. To do so:

1. On the upper-left corner, select **Products menu** > **Application** on the **BUILD** section.

3. On the application page, open the **Main Settings** tab and enable the Functions switch.

4. On the dropdown function menu, select the function related to your integration.

This action will load the function, showing a form with the function’s code and, just above it, two tabs: **Code** and **Args**.

On the **Code** tab, you’ll be able to navigate through the code, but won’t be able to change it. On the **Args** tab, you’ll pass the parameters.
