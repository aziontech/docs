**Azion Integrations** allows you to improve, compose, or customize your applications. These integrations are based on edge functions and are executed on the edge. This documentation will guide you to install an integration in an existing edge application.

Considering Azion Marketplace has integrations that run edge functions in two ways, you'll need to proceed according to the type of integration you want to install:

- [Edge Application integrations](#edge-application-integrations)
- [Edge Firewall integrations](#edge-firewall-integrations)

## Edge Application integrations

These integrations run tasks and services on the edge, closer to the user, employing an *existing* edge application.

:::tip
To build a new edge application, go to the [building](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/build-an-application/) section for more details on this topic.
:::

To install and instantiate this type of integration, follow the next steps.

### Getting the integration

Access [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/) and go to **Marketplace** to select the integration you want to install.

After selecting the integration, click the **Get It Now** button, at the bottom-right corner of the page, and a successful message appears to confirm your integration is installed.

:::tip
You can search any integration by browsing through the cards or typing a keyword in the search box.

### Configuring the integration

Once you’ve gotten your integration, you’ll have to select an edge application to use the integration. To do so:

1. On the upper-left corner, select **Products menu** > **Edge Application** on the **BUILD** section.
2. On the listing page of your edge applications, select the one you want to use with the integration.
3. On the application page, open the **Main Settings** tab and enable the Edge Functions switch.
4. Click the **Save** button.

### Instanting the integration

To add the function and set the Args, still on the application page:

1. Select the **Functions** tab.
2. Click the **Add Function** button.
3. Choose an easy to remember name for your function.
4. On the dropdown function menu, select the function related to your integration.

This action will load the function, showing a form with the function’s code and, just above it, two tabs: **Code** and **Args**.

On the **Code** tab, you’ll be able to navigate through the code, but won’t be able to change it. On the **Args** tab, you’ll pass the parameters.
