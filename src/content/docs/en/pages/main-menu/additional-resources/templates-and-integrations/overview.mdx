Azion provides a wide range of options to speed up your workflow: from development and deployment to management and monitoring. This includes [pre-built templates](#azion-templates) to deploy a new project from scratch and [integrations](#azion-integrations) to increase the capabilities of your applications and services.

Through **Azion Edge Platform**, you have access to edge-running software built by Azion's specialized teams and third-party sellers and partners using [Azion Marketplace](/en/documentation/products/marketplace/) as a channel to distribute their products. 

By using **Templates and Integrations**, you can:

- **Save time and resources**: streamline your operations, enhance productivity, and reduce the time and resources required for development tasks by employing pre-configured and reusable code. You can be more efficient and cost-effective, as you don't have to start from scratch or manually configure every aspect of your project.
- **Maintain consistency and avoid errors**: maintain an error-free approach to your projects adhering to standardized configurations or best practices. This reduces the chances of inconsistencies or mistakes across your project.
- **Test and experiment with new technologies**: obtain a structured environment for experimentation and innovation, as well as easily connect and test new tools or services within your existing infrastructure.
- **Scale and adapt your business**: by working with ready-to-use resources, you're able to rapidly meet the evolving needs of your business and ensure your infrastructure remains flexible and responsive to any market challenge.
