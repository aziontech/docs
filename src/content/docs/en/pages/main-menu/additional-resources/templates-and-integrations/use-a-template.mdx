Building an edge application is the first step to start using **Azion Edge Platform**. This documentation presents the step by step to build and deploy a new application, using an Azion template.

Templates are pre-designed and reusable configurations that help to streamline the process of creating applications. In this matter, Azion offers a variety of templates to serve different use cases.

## Getting the template

[Access Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/) and select the **Start with a template** option on the homepage.

This will open the building page where you can select the template you want to start with.

:::note
Some templates are integrated with third-party services and you'll need to comply certain requirements, such a creating an account, generating tokens, or setting up configurations on the third-party platform.

## Setting up the template

Finally, click the **Next** button, located in the bottom-right corner, to start the deployment process.

## Deploying the template

During the deployment, you’ll be able to follow the process through a window showing off the logs. When it’s complete, the *deployment* page appears, confirming the edge application has been successfully created.

This page shows you the basic information of your application, including name, deployment logs, and the Azion domain, as well as some recommendations regarding advanced options to enhance your edge application

:::note
The link to the edge application allows you to see it on the browser. However, ​​it takes a certain time to propagate and configure the application in Azion’s edge locations. It may be necessary to wait a few minutes for the URL to be activated and for the application page to be effectively displayed in the browser.

### Key configurations

After the deployment, each template creates a new edge application and its Azion domain; in some cases, it could create a new edge function as well. Each template also establishes some pre-defined key configurations to optimize your application's performance.

Additionally, to guarantee the optimal performance of certain templates, it could be necessary to activate some Azion products.

Go to the [guides page](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/#azion-templates) and check more details on the specific template you're willing to use.

:::tip
