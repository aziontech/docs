Building an edge application is the first step to start using **Azion Edge Platform**. In this matter, templates are pre-designed and reusable configurations that help to streamline the process of creating applications. Azion offers a variety of templates to serve different use cases.

This documentation presents the step by step to build and deploy a new application, using an Azion template.

## Getting the template

To get a template:

1. [Access Azion Console](https://console.azion.com).
2. Click the **+ Create** button on the homepage.
3. In the modal, select the Templates option.
4. Browse and choose the one you want to start with.

:::note
Some templates are integrated with third-party services and you'll need to comply with certain requirements, such as creating an account, generating tokens, or setting up configurations. Additionally, it could be necessary to activate some Azion products. Go to the [guides page](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/#azion-templates) and check more details on the specific template you're willing to use.

## Setting up the template

After selecting the template you want to use, the configuration page will open. On this page, you must provide the information to configure your application.

Finally, click the **Deploy** button, located in the bottom-right corner, to start the deployment process.

:::note
Some templates are integrated with GitHub. In this case, you must connect Azion to your GitHub account.

When displayed, click the **Connect with GitHub** button. This will open a pop-up where you can confirm the connection and set your permissions and repository access as desired.
:::

During the deployment, you'll be able to follow the process through a window showing off the logs. When it's complete, the page shows information about the application, including name, deploy logs, and Azion domain, and some options to continue your journey.

:::note
The link to the edge application allows you to see it on the browser. However, â€‹it takes a certain time to propagate and configure the application in Azion's edge locations. It may be necessary to wait a few minutes for the URL to be activated and for the application page to be effectively displayed in the browser.

### Key configurations

After the deployment, each template creates a new edge application and its Azion domain; in some cases, it could create a new edge function as well. Each template also establishes some pre-defined key configurations to optimize your application's performance.

Go to the [guides page](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/#azion-templates) and check more details on the specific template you're willing to use.

:::tip
To know more on how to edit and customize your application's main settings, go to the [Configuring main settings](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/configure-main-settings/) guide. You can also [Go live with Azion](/en/documentation/products/go-live-with-azion/), adding a custom domain and poiting your traffic.
