**Edge Functions** for **Edge Application** enables you to instantiate serverless functions within your Azion edge application, while also configuring execution conditions. These functions are processed at the edge, responding to events with remarkable speed, thus ensuring superior scalability and availability.

> Edge functions are also available for [Edge Firewall](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/edge-functions-instances/).

## Function instance

To instantiate an edge function in your edge application, you must first create one using **Edge Functions**. Once the function is saved, you can proceed with the instantiation for your applications.

During the instantiation process, the function's code can't be modified. Instead, the arguments, or **Args**, that will be passed to the context of the function's execution in JSON format must be informed.

## Run Function

You can create a rule using **Rules Engine** and, with the **Run Function** behavior, select the execution phase and the criteria that will trigger the rule. When a request meets the defined criteria in the rule, the edge function will be invoked and executed directly in Azion's edge nodes.

## Limits

The **Args** field supports a maximum of 100KB of arguments.
