**Domains** is an Azion's [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/) tool that provides a domain generation and management service.

When you [build an edge application](/en/documentation/products/getting-started/), your application is given an automatically generated **Azion domain**, in the format `xxxx.map.azionedge.net`. You can create multiple domains for your edge applications.

If you already own a domain, you can [redirect your traffic to Azion](/en/documentation/products/guides/point-domain-to-azion/) by configuring the records in your DNS provider and listing your **custom domains**.

You may also bind a **Digital Certificate** to domains that use the HTTPS protocol.

## Environment

Before going operational, you can activate a testing configuration to preview setups. When creating a new Domain, you can choose the environment type:

- **Production**: production environment of the application. The Azion domain will be in the format `xxxx.map.azionedge.net`.
- **Preview**: environment for testing the application. This configuration won't impact the **Production** environment. The Azion domain will be in the format `xxxx.preview.azionedge.net`.

To enable environment selection, contact the [Sales Team](https://www.azion.com/en/contact-sales/).

## CNAME

CNAME is the standard service responsible for creating CNAME settings, enabling you to customize the edge application's  domain. Each domain can accommodate up to 50 CNAMEs.

You may restrict access to your application from the Azion domain by enabling the **CNAME Access Only** switch.

---

## Digital Certificate

To use your domain in HTTPS, you'll need a TLS certificate (X.509). Without additional costs, you may include your TLS certificates in [Real-Time Manager](http://manager.azion.com) or generate a *Let's Encrypt*™ certificate, which will be automatically managed by Azion.

---

## Support for Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS)

Azion's Domains also have **Support for Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS)**, an authentication method for users and visitors that validates the digital certificate on both sides of a request, client, and edge (server). Adding support for mTLS to your **Edge Application** ensures a more secure *TLS/TLS handshake* and is an *Open Banking* requirement.

:::tip
You may need mTLS if your edge application deals with financial services and payments.

## Local staging of custom domain

The local `etc/hosts` file maps IP addresses to domains. When you [associate the edge node IP with the CNAME](/en/documentation/products/guides/test-edge-application-through-hosts-file/) assigned to your domain in your `hosts` file, you force your computer's DNS resolution to access this domain through the edge node and not through public DNS servers. This way, you can stage your application locally as if it were already deployed on your custom domain on the edge before you [point your domain](/en/documentation/products/guides/point-domain-to-azion/) to Azion.
