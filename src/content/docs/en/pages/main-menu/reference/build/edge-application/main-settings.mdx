## Modules

The activation of the modules listed below may generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/) for more information.

### Application Accelerator

The **Application Accelerator**  module speeds up web applications and APIs through protocol optimizations and manages dynamic content requirements.

<LinkButton link="  " label="Learn more about Application Accelerator" />

### Edge Cache

**Edge Cache** allows you to configure how your application caches content, reducing latency and increasing transfer rates through Azion's network of edge nodes. This not only enhances performance and scalability for your content but also cuts back on infrastructure costs.

<LinkButton link="/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-cache/" label="Learn more about Edge Cache" />

### Edge Functions

**Edge Functions** allow you to run custom serverless code, closer to your users. This enables low-latency execution for tasks such as personalizing content, processing API requests, enhancing security, and integrating with third-party services. You can use them to create dynamic, scalable, and efficient applications without managing traditional server infrastructure.

### Image Processor

**Image Processor** can manipulate and process images directly at the edge, which allows you to optimize content transfer times and elevate user experience across your applications.

<LinkButton link="/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/image-processor/" label="Learn more about Image Processor" />

### Tiered Cache

**Tiered Cache** creates an additional cache layer between the edge and your origin servers, reducing latency and infrastructure costs.

## Debug Rules

Log executed rules created in Rules Engine. Query logs using Data Stream, Real-Time Events, or Real-Time Events GraphQL API.

Rules that were successfully executed will be shown under the `$traceback` field in Data Streaming and Real-Time Events or the `$stacktrace` variable in GraphQL.s
