**Application Acceleration** is an **Edge Application** module that speeds up web applications and APIs through protocol optimizations and manages dynamic content requirements.

With Application Acceleration, you can:

- Create advanced rules in [Rules Engine](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/rules-engine/) for the request and response phases.
- Customize cache policies for dynamic content based on cookies or query strings through the [Advanced Cache Key](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/cache-settings/#advanced-cache-key/).
- Enable support and cache of HTTP methods for your edge application.
- Customize [CDN cache TTL](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/cache-settings/#cdn-cache-settings) to values under 60 seconds.

## Advanced Cache Key

By default, Azion considers each URL as a distinct object in cache. The **Advanced Cache Key** feature allows you to create advanced cache rules based on two options: **Cache by Query Strings** and **Cache by Cookies**. If needed, you can use both options simultaneously to define the content segmentation of your application.

## Rules Engine

**Application Acceleration** enables new options and configurations in **Rules Engine**, allowing you to customize your application's business rules. See the full [list of variables](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/rules-engine/#variables) and [list of behaviors](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/rules-engine/#behaviors) to know more.

## Support for HTTP methods

You can expand the supported HTTP methods beyond the native `GET` and `HEAD` methods for your edge applications. By enabling this feature, you'll gain the ability to utilize the `OPTIONS`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` HTTP methods in your applications.

By default, Azion's edge caching is configured to cache only `GET` and `HEAD` requests. However, by enabling this module, you have the option to extend caching to include `POST` and `OPTIONS` requests as well. This allows you to optimize the performance and efficiency of your applications, especially for frequently accessed or data-intensive endpoints that use these HTTP methods.
