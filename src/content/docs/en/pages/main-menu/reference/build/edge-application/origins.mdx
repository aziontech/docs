**Origins** allows you to customize the source address of your **Edge Application** content, the `Host` header of your application, the path, and the HMAC authentication credentials for protected services.

An origin represents the server from which Azion retrieves your content, which can be an object storage service or a cloud server. Once an origin is connected to your application, edge nodes cache the content from the origin server and serve it to users upon request.

## Implementation

| Scope | Resource |
| --- | --- |
| Edge Application first steps | [First steps](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/first-steps/#origins) |
| Load Balancer module | [Load Balancer](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/load-balancer/) |

## Origin Type

There are two options for you to customize your origin:

- **Single Origin**: create one **Address** for each origin.
- **Load Balancer**: add multiple **Addressess** and determine load weight and server role.

## Host Header

The `Host` header is used by your origin to identify the *virtualhost* and locate your content or application. When configuring an origin in [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/), you have the option to customize the value sent by Azion in the `Host` header.

If the **Host Header** field is left blank, Azion will use the same address specified in the **Address** field as the default. If your origin is configured to respond to a *virtualhost* using the same address as configured in DNS, you can leave the **Host Header** field empty.

However, if your origin responds to a *virtualhost* at an address different from the one set in DNS, you must fill in a custom value for the `Host` header in FQDN format, for example, `www.yourdomain.com`.

:::caution
Customizing the `Host` header is essential if your origin responds to a *virtualhost* at an address other than the one configured in DNS.
:::

Alternatively, you can use the `${host}` variable in the **Host Header** field to instruct the edge nodes to pass on the `Host` header received from your visitors to the origin. This setting is useful if you have multiple *virtualhosts* being served by the same origin.

---

## Origin Path

**Origin Path** allows you to specify a custom path from which edge nodes will request your origin content. Azion appends the **Origin Path** to the URI when forwarding the request to your origin, but it doesn't append the URI for user requests. For instance, if you determine that the path of your origin is under `/secure` and you have configured your application to be delivered through `yourdomain.com`, the `/secure` path won't be part of the request to the end user.

:::caution
The definition of an **Origin Path** is optional. If not specified, only the root URI will be considered.

## Address

To define an origin for your content, you need to specify the address of your server as either a domain name in FQDN format or an IPv4/IPv6 address. If you have defined the **Origin Protocol Policy** as **Enforce HTTP** or **Enforce HTTPS**, you can customize the origin port using the notation `host:port`.

---

## Origin Protocol Policy

Azion's delivery architecture offers you the flexibility to tailor the type of connection between the edge nodes and your origin based on your specific requirements:

- **Preserve HTTP/HTTPS protocol**: this option maintains the same connection protocol (*HTTP or HTTPS*) and ports used by your users when accessing your content on Azion. It ensures seamless continuity from Azion to your origin server.
- **Enforce HTTP**: with this setting, the connection between Azion's edge nodes and your origin will be exclusively through HTTP, regardless of the connection protocol and ports used by your users to access Azion's content. You can customize a specific port for your origin in the **Address** field, deviating from the default port (80 for HTTP) if desired.
- **Enforce HTTPS**: this option mandates the connection between Azion's edge nodes and your origin to be exclusively through HTTPS, regardless of the connection protocol and ports used by your users to access Azion's content. You can customize a specific port for your origin in the **Address** field, different from the default port (443 for HTTPS) if required.

---

## HMAC Authentication 

For **Single Origin**, if the origin is located in an object storage with private access, you must provide HMAC authentication credentials. When enabling HMAC authentication, your private content will begin to be delivered to your users through **Edge Application**. 

You should include in the HMAC access credentials given by your storage provider: **Region**, **Access Key**, and **Secret Key**. 

:::note
**Secret Key** is protected by being displayed only to its users with write permission and maintaining their access security.

## Timeouts 

Displays timeout setting in seconds pre-defined by Azion. Timeout values can't be customized.
