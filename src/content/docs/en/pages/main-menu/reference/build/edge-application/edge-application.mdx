**Edge Application** is an Azion product that allows you to build applications that run in Azion's edge network. By reducing latency and enhancing throughput, Edge Application optimizes your end-user experience by bringing your application closer to them.

By operating on a reverse proxy architecture, Edge Application allows you to create applications on the edge and direct traffic from your domain to Azion. Through this process, your users can effortlessly access your application via a highly distributed global network of edge nodes. Then, Azion selects which edge node closest to the user can handle the request.

Your content or application has to be available from one or several origins. This origin can consist of one or more web servers from your infrastructure, a cloud service, or one of Azion's **Origin** services.

With Edge Application, you can:

- Define how your content will be cached.
- Execute functions at the edge.
- Bring your business rules for any request or response.
- Optimize content and image delivery for your users.
- Customize origins and error pages.

<LinkButton severity="secondary" label="Build your first edge application" link="/en/documentation/products/getting-started/" />

You can create and manage edge applications using:

- [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com).
- [Azion API](https://api.azion.com).
- [Azion CLI](/en/documentation/products/azion-cli/overview/).
- [Azion Terraform Provider](/en/documentation/products/terraform-provider/).

## Modules

Modules can complement your implementation of **Edge Application**. You can enable or disable modules in the **Main Settings** tab of your application, provided your account supports them and there are no existing dependencies upon deactivation.

See the documentation for each module:

| Module | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Application Accelerator](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/application-accelerator/) | Optimize API protocols and manage dynamic content delivery to accelerate applications and APIs. |
| [Edge Cache](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-cache/) | Configure cache settings to speed up the delivery of static and dynamic content. |
| [Edge Functions](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-functions/) | Build ultra-low latency applications and customize content delivery. |
| [Image Processor](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/image-processor/) | Optimize image processing for various devices, browsers, and screen resolutions. |
| [Load Balancer](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/load-balancer/) | Balance traffic between your origin servers and cloud providers to improve fault tolerance and avoid network congestion. |
| [Tiered Cache](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/tiered-cache/) | Add a cache layer between your users and the edge to keep objects in cache for longer periods of time. |
| [WebSocket Proxy](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/websocket/) | Enable the WebSocket protocol to establish full-duplex communication channels over one TCP connection. |

---

## Advanced settings

**Edge Application** allows advanced configuration of origins, cache, functions, error pages, and more, optimizing content delivery for improved performance and user experience.

See the documentation for each available setting:

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Main Settings](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/main-settings/) | Customize your application delivery with Azion's range of protocol options including HTTP, HTTPS, and HTTP/3 support for a better user experience and secure your connection with TLS ciphers. |
| [Origins](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/origins/) | Modify your origin address, `Host` header, path, protocol policies, and HMAC authentication credentials. |
| [Device Groups](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/device-groups/) | Create groups to change your application's cache and delivery behavior according to end-user devices. |
| [Error Responses](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/error-responses/) | Customize error response pages, their cache expiration time, and their origin. |
| [Cache Settings](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/cache-settings/) | Configure your application's browser and edge cache expiration time, large file optimization, and advanced cache behavior based on cookies or query strings. |
| [Functions](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-functions-instances/) | Instantiate functions created with **Edge Functions**. |
| [Rules Engine](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/rules-engine/) | Automate the execution of behaviors based on specific parameters for your edge application. |

## Domains

Azion **Domains** provides you with the flexibility to use automatically generated domains or your own custom domains, allowing you to manage and deliver content effectively through your edge applications with support for secure connections over HTTP and HTTPS.

<LinkButton severity="secondary" label="Learn more about Domains" link="/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/domains/" />

---

## Digital Certificates

With **Digital Certificates**, you can enhance the security of your HTTPS applications by binding a custom TLS certificate to your edge application.

<LinkButton severity="secondary" label="Learn more about Digital Certificates" link="/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-firewall/digital-certificates/" />

---

## Real-Time Purge

Use **Real-Time Purge** to clear cached content from Azion's edge or from the [tiered cache layer]](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/tiered-cache/) to maintain content accuracy, reduce outdated content delivery, and deliver an optimal user experience on your edge application.

## Limits

:::tip
**Increase limits** <br></br>
You can request to increase the limits based on your plan. Contact the [technical support team](/en/documentation/services/support/) to request it.
:::

These are the **default limits**:

| Scope | Limit |
| ----- | ----- |
| Minimum CDN cache TTL | 60 seconds<br /><br />For the [Application Accelerator](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/application-accelerator/) module: 0 seconds |
| Debug Rules log size | 1.5 kB |
| Edge-client keepalive connection¹ | 10 to 15 minutes |
| Single object size in cache | 10 GB |

> ¹ Azion enforces a keepalive connection duration limit between users and edge applications. To avoid the termination of active connections that require more time to complete, consider implementing [file slicing](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/cache-settings/#slice-settings) or [file compression](/en/documentation/products/guides/gzip-compression/) for large files to improve data transfer speeds.

These are the **default limits** for each Service Plan:

| Scope | Developer | Business | Enterprise | Mission Critical |
| ----- | --------- | -------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| Edge applications per account | 10 | 50 | 200 | Customizable |
