**Edge Application** is an Azion product that allows you to build applications that run in Azion's edge network. By reducing latency and enhancing throughput, Edge Application optimizes your end-user experience by bringing your application closer to them.

By operating on a reverse proxy architecture, Edge Application allows you to create applications on the edge and direct traffic from your domain to Azion. Through this process, your users can effortlessly access your application via a highly distributed global network of edge nodes. Then, Azion selects which edge node closest to the user can handle the request.

Your content or application has to be available from one or several origins. This origin can consist of one or more web servers from your infrastructure, a cloud service, or one of Azion's **Origin** services.

With Edge Application, you can:

- Define how your content will be cached.
- Execute functions at the edge.
- Bring your business rules for any request or response.
- Optimize content and image delivery for your users.
- Customize origins and error pages.

<Button text ="Build your first edge application" href="/en/documentation/products/getting-started/"></Button>

You can create and manage edge applications using:

- [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).
- [Azion API](https://api.azion.com).
- [Azion CLI](/en/documentation/products/cli/).
- [Azion Terraform Provider](/en/documentation/products/terraform-provider/).

| [Cache Settings](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/cache-settings/) | Configure your application's browser and edge cache expiration time, large file slicing, and advanced cache behavior based on cookies or query strings. |
| [Functions](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-functions-instances/) | Instantiate functions created with **Edge Functions**. |
| [Rules Engine](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/rules-engine/) | Automate the execution of behaviors based on specific parameters for your edge application. |

## Domains

Azion **Domains** provides you with the flexibility to use automatically generated domains or your own custom domains, allowing you to manage and deliver content effectively through your edge applications with support for secure connections over HTTP and HTTPS.

<Button text ="Learn more about Domains" href="/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/domains/"></Button>

---

## Digital Certificates

With **Digital Certificates**, you can enhance the security of your HTTPS applications by binding a custom TLS certificate to your edge application.

<Button text ="Learn more about Digital Certificates" href="/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/digital-certificates/"></Button>

---

## Real-Time Purge

Use **Real-Time Purge** to clear cached content from Azion's edge or from the [Layer 2](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/l2-caching/) to maintain content accuracy, reduce outdated content delivery, and deliver an optimal user experience on your edge application. 

<Button text ="Learn more about Real-Time Purge" href="/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/real-time-purge/"></Button>

---

## Limits

### Keepalive timeout

Azion enforces a keepalive connection duration limit of 10 to 15 minutes between users and edge applications. To avoid the termination of active connections that require more time to complete, consider implementing [file slicing](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/cache-settings/#slice-settings) or [file compression](/en/documentation/products/guides/gzip-compression/) for large files to improve data transfer speeds.

### Domains

These are the **default limits** for each Service Plan:

| Developer | Business | Enterprise | Mission Critical |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 100 | 100 | 100 | 1,000 |

:::tip
**Increase limits** <br></br>
You can request to increase the limits based on your plan. Contact the [technical support team](/en/documentation/services/support/) to request it.

## Billing

**Edge Application** has specific metrics that define how the product is billed.

### Total Data Transferred

Total volume of data transferred by **Azion Edge Computing Platform**, whether it's delivered through cache or fetched from an origin, calculated in GB. Considers data passing through:

- All customer's domains.
- Users and Azion's Edge Servers.
- Origin servers, even if the origin belongs to the **Azion Network**, such as by using **Image Processor** or **Live Ingest** services.
- **Edge Application** and any of its modules and features enabled.

There are several different scenarios in which data is transferred through Azion. For example:

- Content delivered using an edge functions

When an edge application delivers content created through an edge function on Azion, the request flow is processed fully through Azion servers and delivered directly to users.

![Overview of a request/response flow using Edge Functions](/assets/docs/images/uploads/data-transferred-edge-functions)

- Content offloaded through cache

When content is found in Azion's cache, meaning there was a *HIT* in **Edge Cache**, it's delivered directly by the edge, without searching for the content on the origin. For clients using **Tiered Cache**, if there's a *MISS* in the Edge Cache layer but a *HIT* in the Tiered Cache layer, the content is still delivered directly by the edge.

Content hosted through **Object Storage** can also be stored in cache and be delivered directly by the edge.

![Overview of a request/response flow of HIT in Edge Cache](/assets/docs/images/uploads/data-transferred-hit-cache)

- Content feteched from an origin

When content isn't found in Azion's cache, meaning there was a *MISS* in **Edge Cache**, Azion searches and fetches the content from the origin to deliver it to the user. For clients using **Tiered Cache**, there can be a *MISS* in both the Edge Cache and the Tiered Cache layer, and the content is searched on the origin before being delivered by the edge.

For clients using **Object Storage**, Azion can also search and fetch the content from the origin if there's a *MISS* in **Edge Cache**. In this case, the origin is the object storage that was configured in the product.

![Overview of a request/response flow of MISS in Edge Cache](/assets/docs/images/uploads/data-transferred-miss-cache-image-processor)

- Content using Image Processor fetched from an origin

Similar to the **Content offloaded through cache** and **Content fetched from an origin** flows, when the **Image Processor** module is enabled, images can be searched on **Edge Cache** and **Tiered Cached**, if enabled, and in case of a miss, the image is fetched from the origin and delivered by the edge, and cached for future requests.

![Overview of a request/response flow of MISS in Edge Cache with Image Processor module](/assets/docs/images/uploads/data-transferred-miss-cache-image-processor.png)

Furthermore, enabling other features can affect how traffic is processed. For example, if you enable *Gzip compression* for files, Azion will verify if the compressed version of the file is in cache for any request. If it is, it'll delivered to the user. If it isn't, Azion compresses the file, delivers it to the user, and stores it in cache for future requests.

When **Real-Time Purge** is used to remove an object using the URL or cache key from either the **Tiered Cache** or **Edge Cache** layers, subsequent requests for purged content will result in a cache *MISS* and will be redirected to the origin. Once the updated object is cached at the edge, in a cache *HIT* case, the content is retrieved from cache instead of the origin.

### Requests

Total amount of HTTP and HTTPS requests from a user or device made to edge applications running on **Azion Edge Computing Platform**. A request is billed independently of request success or failure and server protocol version (HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2.0, HTTP/3.0).

When content such as an image cached at the edge is requested, it isn't billed.

When a request using [Image Processor](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/image-processor/) is processed, it counts as one request independently of the number of query strings being used to apply filters. For example, if the request queries three filters, it's billed as one request.
