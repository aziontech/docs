:::

**Applications** is an Azion product that allows you to build applications that run in Azion's infrastructure. By reducing latency and enhancing throughput, Applications optimizes your end-user experience by bringing your application closer to them.

By operating on a reverse proxy architecture, Applications allows you to create applications on the edge and direct traffic from your domain to Azion. Through this process, your users can access your application via a highly distributed global network of edge nodes. Then, Azion selects which edge node closest to the user can handle the request.

Your content or application must be served from one or more origins. An origin, also called your applications backend, can be made up of one or more web servers in your infrastructure, a cloud service, or [Object Storage](/en/documentation/products/store/edge-storage/). *Connector* is used to connect to these origin sources. For more information, see the [Connector reference](/en/documentation/products/secure/connector/).
With Applications, you can:

- Define how your content will be cached.
- Execute functions at the edge.
- Bring your business rules for any request or response.
- Optimize content and image delivery for your users.

<LinkButton severity="secondary" label="Build your first application" link="/en/documentation/products/getting-started/" />

You can create and manage applications using:

- [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com).
- [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/v4#).
- [Azion CLI](/en/documentation/products/azion-cli/overview/).
- [Azion Terraform Provider](/en/documentation/products/terraform-provider/).

## Modules

Modules can complement your implementation of **Applications**. You can enable or disable modules in the **Main Settings** tab of your application, provided your account supports them and there are no existing dependencies upon deactivation.

See the documentation for each module:

| Module | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Application Accelerator](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/application-accelerator/) | Optimize API protocols and manage dynamic content delivery to accelerate applications and APIs. |
| [Cache](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/cache/) | Configure cache settings to speed up the delivery of static and dynamic content. |
| [Functions](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/functions/) | Build ultra-low latency applications and customize content delivery. |
| [Image Processor](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/image-processor/) | Optimize image processing for various devices, browsers, and screen resolutions. |
| [Tiered Cache](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/tiered-cache/) | Add a cache layer between your users and the edge to keep objects in cache for longer periods of time. |

---

## Advanced settings

**Applications** lets you manage caching, functions, and other settings. These capabilities help you optimize content delivery for better performance and user experience.

See the documentation for each available setting:

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Main Settings](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/main-settings/) | Manage modules like Application Accelerator and Image Processor |
| [Device Groups](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/device-groups/) | Create groups to change your application's cache and delivery behavior according to end-user devices. |
| [Cache Settings](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/cache-settings/) | Configure your application's browser and edge cache expiration time, large file optimization, and advanced cache behavior based on cookies or query strings. |
| [Functions](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/functions-instances/) | Instantiate functions created with **Functions**. |
| [Rules Engine](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/rules-engine/) | Automate the execution of behaviors based on specific parameters for your application. |

---

## Real-Time Purge

Use **Real-Time Purge** to clear cached content from Azion's edge or from the [tiered cache layer]](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/tiered-cache/) to maintain content accuracy, reduce outdated content delivery, and deliver an optimal user experience on your application.

## Limits

:::tip
**Increase limits** <br></br>
You can request to increase the limits based on your plan. Contact the [technical support team](/en/documentation/services/support/) to request it.
:::

These are the **default limits**:

| Scope | Limit |
| ----- | ----- |
| Minimum CDN cache TTL | 60 seconds<br /><br />For the [Application Accelerator](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/application-accelerator/) module: 0 seconds |
| Debug Rules log size | 1.5 kB |
| Edge-client keepalive connection¹ | 10 to 15 minutes |
| Single object size in cache | 10 GB |

> ¹ Azion enforces a keepalive connection duration limit between users and applications. To avoid the termination of active connections that require more time to complete, consider implementing [file slicing](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/cache-settings/#slice-settings) or [file compression](/en/documentation/products/guides/gzip-compression/) for large files to improve data transfer speeds.

These are the **default limits** for each Service Plan:

| Scope | Developer | Business | Enterprise | Mission Critical |
| ----- | --------- | -------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| Edge applications per account | 10 | 50 | 200 | Customizable |
