Azion **Object Storage** is a scalable and secure storage service designed to integrate file storage with the Azion Edge Computing Platform using the S3 standard. Buckets can be used as origins for Edge Applications or as directories for real-time file upload.

In addition to creating, modifying, and deleting buckets, you have full control over storage use, allowing you to manage read and write permissions.

## Buckets

Buckets are a system to organize stored objects, or files. Similar to folders, buckets are the top-level storage containers where files are uploaded. All buckets are stored in the us-west cloud server.

Since bucket names identify buckets, each bucket should have a unique name. No special characters aside from dash (`-`) are allowed. Best practices for naming buckets include specifying what types of files are stored and the type of permissions for the files. For example, a bucket for an edge application `Banking App` in read-only mode could be named `banking-app-ro`.

## Permissions

Actions involving buckets, such as uploading, listing, and deleting files, always require authorization. This can come in the form of **Permissions** and Azion account **Authentication**.

The permissions available are:

- **Read-only**: files in the bucket can only be read but not modified.
- **Read-write**: files in the bucket can be modified.

Personal and sensitive information shouldn't be uploaded to the bucket or in file names as S3 buckets don't meet privacy protection requirements.

## Prefix

When **Object Storage** is selected as an [origin type](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/origins/) in Real-Time Manager, you must configure two fields: **Bucket Name** and **Prefix**.

The prefix is the path to a folder within the bucket that contains the objects. This field may be left blank if you wish your application origin to be the root of the bucket itself.
