**Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS)**, also known as *Mutual Authentication*, is an authentication method that validates the digital certificate on both sides of a request: on the client side and on the Edge.

With **mTLS** activated, Azion checks the user's browser certificate and validates it with the **Trusted Certificate (Trusted CA)**, of your **Edge Application**.

mTLS is optional for applications using *TLS* protocols. However, it does promise a more secure TLS *handshake* and is an *Open Banking* requirement.

> You may need mTLS if your Edge Application offers financial services and payments.

## Prerequisites

It's necessary that your **Edge Application** is operating with the *Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)* protocol. [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com) allows you to configure **mTLS** in applications running with HTTP only (without the TLS encryption layer). However, mTLS requires an HTTPS connection to work.

Protocol options are available on your **Edge Application** configuration page in RTM.

> **Note:** mTLS will only be available if the service is activated. Contact our [Sales Team](https://www.azion.com/en/contact-sales/) to activate it.

## Digital Certificate with support for mTLS (Trusted CA)

To configure **mTLS** in your **Edge Application**, you need a *Digital Certificate* that supports mTLS, generated by a *Third-Party Certificate Authority*. At Azion, we call this certificate **Trusted CA**.

Select or add a new *Domain* and make sure the mTLS option is enabled. Then select the previously added Trusted CA.

> Free certificates, generated internally by Azion (Azion [SAN]), don't support mTLS.

To use mTLS *Enforce* mode, you must use *Server Name Indication (SNI)* extension to the traditional TLS protocol.

Connections without SNI are connected to the default configuration, which, at the time of the TLS handshake, delivers the Azion SAN certificate.

When we have requests without SNI for a Domain with mTLS in *Enforce* mode, the connection will be interrupted before the route of your Edge Application is resolved.

> Make sure your Edge Applications always use SNI on requests.

## How mTLS works at Azion

The default configuration of **mTLS** blocks accesses whose user identity can't be verified.

If your application needs special access, it is necessary to configure a permissive check (*Permissive mTLS*). Permissive checking can be configured on the *Domains* page.

You can also change and specify the *header variables* of your **mTLS** to meet Open Banking requirements. This can be done in the **Edge Application** configuration page, within [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com).

> The list of accepted variables is available on the [Rules Engine for Edge Application](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/rules-engine/) page.
