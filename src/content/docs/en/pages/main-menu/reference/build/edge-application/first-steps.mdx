Before using **Applications**, make sure you have:

- An Azion Console account. You can find more information about how to create your account on the [documentation page](/en/documentation/products/accounts/creating-account/).
- An application. If you haven't created an application yet, check the [build an application](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/build-an-application/) page.

> See also the guides on [how to clone](/en/documentation/products/guides/clone-applications/) and [how to delete](/en/documentation/products/guides/delete-applications/) an application.

## Main Settings

To access the main settings and configure your application:

1. [Access Azion Console](https://console.azion.com).
2. On the upper-left corner of the page, open the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, and then select **Applications**.
3. Select the application you want to configure.

You're now in the page to configure the general delivery settings of your application. 

### Applications Modules

**Applications** offers the following modules:

- [Application Accelerator](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/application-accelerator/)
- [Cache](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/cache/)
- [Functions](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/edge-functions/)
- [Image Processor](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/image-processor/)
- [Tiered Cache](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/tiered-cache/)

Some **Applications modules** are billed products and it may generate usage-related costs. Check the [Applications modules pricing](/en/documentation/products/pricing/) for more information.

To enable a module in your application:

1. [Access Console](https://console.azion.com).
2. On the upper-left corner of the page, select **Products Menu** > **Applications**.
3. Select the application.
4. In the **Main Settings** tab, under the **Modules** section, activate the desired module.
5. Click the **Save** button.

## Advanced settings

Other than the **Main Settings** tab, you'll see several other tabs:

- [Device Groups](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/device-groups/)
- [Cache Settings](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/cache-settings/)
- [Functions](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/functions-instances/)
- [Rules Engine](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/rules-engine/)

Each tab stores in other configuration options for your application.

### Configuring Your Backend (Origin) Connection

A backend, also known as an origin, is the server from which Azion retrieves your content. This can include object storage services, cloud servers, or other infrastructure that hosts your application assets or data.

To configure your application's origin you'll use [Connector](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-connector/).

1. [Access Console](https://console.azion.com).
2. On the upper-left corner of the page, select **Products Menu** > **Connector**.
3. Create an Connector by clicking the **\+ Connector** button.
4. In the field **Connector Type**, select the desired Connector Type.
5. Fill in the remaining fields.
6. Click the **Save** button.

:::note
For more details on Connector Types, please visit the [Connector reference](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-connector/).
:::

To activate an Connector:

1. Access the **Rules Engine** tab.
2. Edit the default rule or add a new request phase rule.
3. In the **Criteria** section, to apply the origin for your whole application, set the criteria to **If `${uri}` starts with `/`**.
4. In the **Behavior** section, select the **Set Connector** behavior.
5. Select the Connector you want to apply.
6. Click the **Save** button.

**Connector** enables you to configure multiple origins and distribute traffic among them by using [Load Balancer](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-connector/load-balancer/).

:::tip
You can use [Custom Pages](/en/documentation/products/secure/custom-pages/) to configure custom error pages that are displayed when **Connector** receives specific error responses (such as HTTP 4xx or 5xx status codes) from your origin.

### Device Groups

Manage devices using [Device Groups](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/device-groups/):

1. Access the **Device Groups** tab.

4. Click the **+ Device Group** button.
5. Select the device group from the list.
6. Click the **Save** button.

The `${device_group}` variable will also be available in **Rules Engine**:
