**Rules Engine** is an **Edge Application** feature that handles the conditional execution of behaviors through logical operators. By using Rules Engine, you can build an architecture that provides better performance to your users while consuming fewer resources by processing at the edge.

Each request made to an application built with Azion [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com/) is processed in a fixed sequence of two phases:

1. **Request Phase**: takes place when a user submits a request to the edge application.
2. **Response Phase**: occurs when a user receives a response from the edge application.

At each processing phase, you can define a set of rules to handle the request according to the needs of your application. Once you've selected in which of the two phases your rule will be executed, you'll be able to create a new rule.

Rules are designed to follow a conditional *if-then* logic. Every rule is composed of **Criteria** (*if*) that will define the set of conditions that must be met for the execution of **Behaviors** (*then*).

To trigger the intended behaviors for your application, you may employ variables, comparison operators, and logical operators. If the given conditions are met, the behaviors associated with each rule are executed sequentially until all the rules have been processed.

:::caution
Before you create a rule, you should enable the [Application Accelerator](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/application-accelerator/) module, which extends the usability of **Rules Engine** by applying serverless computing features to **Edge Application**. If the module is disabled, only some variables and behaviors will be available for your rule.

---

## Processing phases

When creating a rule, you'll be prompted to select one of the two available processing phases: **Request Phase** or **Response Phase**.

### Request Phase

During the **Request Phase**, the edge handles end-user requests. For Request Phase rules, any variables associated with the data provided by the user in the request can be utilized. However, variables related to the content that will be delivered to the user in this phase aren't accessible, as the response hasn't been processed by the application yet.

Additionally, it's in the Request Phase that you determine how your application will cache the content. If your application doesn't permit any form of caching, you have the option to define the conditions under which caching should be disregarded.

### Response Phase

During the **Response Phase**, your application delivers data to end-users. All handling processes in this phase are dynamic, and each user's delivery is performed independently based on their specific requirements.

---

## Description

Aside from the name of the rule, you can add a description to your rule using the **Description** field. Your description will be visible from the rule list and can be used to help you identify what the rule does.

---

## Criteria

The **Criteria** section of **Rules Engine** is where you define the conditions for executing the rule. Criteria are composed of:

- variables
- comparison operators
- arguments, when applicable

The inclusion of arguments in a criteria depends on the comparison operators chosen. The format of the arguments is described in the [variables](#variables) and [comparison operators](#comparison-operators) sections below. You can also add [logical operators](#logical-operators) to increase the amount of comparisons that the rule will execute.

For example, this criteria identifies whether a user is accessing your application via a desktop web browser using a regular expression as an argument:

| | Variable | Comparison operator | Argument |
| --- | ---- | --- | --- |
| If | `${http_user_agent}` | *matches* | `(Chrome\|Mozilla)` |

---

</TableContainer>

### Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS) variables

Add these variables inside the **Rules Engine** of your edge application to configure **Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS)**. mTLS variables are only available for the **Request Phase**. 

| Variable | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `${ssl_client_fingerprint}` | The Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1) of the client certificate | `2fd4e1c67a2d28fced849` |
| `${ssl_client_escaped_cert}` | The client certificate in Private Enhanced Mail (PEM) formatted as an URL encoded string | `-----BEGIN%20CERTIFICATE-----%0AMIICnz...%0A-----END%20CERTIFICATE-----` |
| `${ssl_client_s_dn}` | Returns the `subject DN` string of the client certificate as a string | `/C=US/ST=California/L=San Francisco/O=Example CA/CN=example.com` |
| `${ssl_client_s_dn_parsed}` | Returns the extracted `subject CN` value of the client certificate as a string | `example.com` |
| `${ssl_client_cert}` | **This variable is deprecated**. Use `${ssl_client_escaped_cert}` instead<br /><br />Returns the client certificate (PEM format) | `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----`<br />`MIICnz...`<br />`-----END CERTIFICATE-----` |
| `${ssl_client_i_dn}` | Returns the `issuer DN` string of the client certificate as a string | `/C=US/ST=California/L=San Francisco/O=Example CA/CN=issuer.com` |
| `${ssl_client_serial}` | Returns the serial number of the client certificate | `6C:0A:83:7E:92:3B:D6:C6:E3:56:50:E7` |
| `${ssl_client_v_end}` | Returns the end date (expiration date) of the client certificate in YYYYMMDDHHmmSS format | `20230115120000` |
| `${ssl_client_v_remain}` | Returns the number of days until the client certificate expires | `100` |
| `${ssl_client_v_start}` | Returns the start date of the client certificate | `20230115120000` |
| `${ssl_client_verify} ` | Returns the result of the client certificate verification | `SUCCESS`<br />`FAILED:reason`<br />`NONE` |

:::tip
Most mTLS services rely on receiving the user certificate. By using [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com), you can send the `${ssl_client_escaped_cert}` variable in the `X-Forward-Client-Cert` (XFCC) header in the request to the origin, and then configure your edge application to use this header with the certificate data.

## Variables as arguments

For behaviors that require an argument, you can use the same variables available for the processing phase. This way, you can, for example, compose request cookies or HTTP headers using data collected during the request phase, such as the user's device group or their geolocation.

For example, for the following rule in the **Response Phase**:

| | Variable | Comparison operator | Argument |
| - | - | - | - |
| If  | `${host}` | *is equal* | `host.com` |

| | Behavior | Argument |
| - | - | - |
| Then | **Add Response Cookie**  | `cookie-host-value=${host}` |

When this rule is active, if the request is made from the host determined in the criteria, the response will return the following header: `Set-Cookie: cookie-host-value=host.com`.

Azion also provides special variables that act as functions and take arguments. The following variables can be used to compose **Behaviors** arguments:

| Variable | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `${cookie_time_offset(number)}` | Returns the current date plus an offset in seconds, entered as an argument, to be used to define the expiration time of a cookie | Use the [Add Response Cookie](#add-cookie) behavior with the argument `cookie-name=cookie-value; Expires=${cookie_time_offset(3600)}` to set the cookie TTL to 1 hour from the time it's created |
| `${encode_base64(string)}` | Returns the arguments coded in base64 | `${encode_base64(http://www.yourdomain.com/)}` assumes `d3d3LmRvbWFpbi5jb20K` |

---

## Comparison Operators

| Operator | Description | Argument type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| is equal | The value of the variable is exactly the same as the argument | string |
| is not equal | The value of the variable isn't the same as the argument | string |
| starts with | The value of the variable starts with the argument | string |
| does not start with | The value of the variable doesn't start with the argument | string |
| matches | The value of the variable matches the regular expression entered as an argument | regular expression |
| does not match | The value of the variable doesn't match the regular expression entered as an argument | regular expression |
| exists | The variable has a defined value. Example: `${arg_search}` exists if a search parameter was sent in the query string | - |
| does not exist | The variable doesn't have a defined value. Example: `${arg_search}` doesn't exist if a search parameter wasn't sent in the query string | - |

---

## Logical operators

Multiple criteria can be defined using the logical operators **AND** and **OR**. 

The operator **AND** has implicit precedence over the operator **OR**. If explicit precedence is required, you can add more criteria groups using the **AND** operator only.

---

## Behaviors

In the **Behaviors** section of the **Rules Engine**, you must add the behaviors you want your rule to perform if the conditions defined in the criteria are met.

For example, this behavior redirects the user to an English version of an FAQ location:

| Behavior | Argument |
| --- | --- |
| Redirect To (302 Found) | `/en-us/faq` |

### Add Cookie
<Badge>Request Phase</Badge> <Badge>Response Phase</Badge>
[<Badge variant="accent">Requires Application Accelerator</Badge>](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/application-accelerator/)

Allows you to add a cookie in the `Set-Cookie` HTTP header. The cookie must be inputted as an argument in the format `cookie-name=cookie-value`. You may use a variable as a cookie value in the format `cookie-name=${arg_cookie}`. 

For cookies in the **Response Phase**, the following [Set-Cookie policies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie) can be added to the argument, after the cookie value and separated by a semicolon (`;`):

- `Expires=date` (EEE, d MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss Z)
- `Domain=domain-value`
- `Path=path-value`
- `Max-age=number` (TTL in seconds, takes precedence over `Expires`)
- `SameSite=value; Secure`
- `HttpOnly`

Multiple policies for the same cookie can be separated by semicolons (`;`). For example: `cookie-name=cookie-value; Domain=domain-value; Path=path-value; SameSite=value`.

You may also use variables as a cookie or policy value, for example: `Path=${uri}; Domain=${host}`.

### Add Header
<Badge>Request Phase</Badge> <Badge>Response Phase</Badge>

Adds a header field to the request that will be sent to the origin or to the response that will be sent to the user.

The header field must be informed as an argument in the format `Field: value`.

### Bypass Cache
<Badge>Request Phase</Badge>
[<Badge variant="accent">Requires Application Accelerator</Badge>](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/application-accelerator/)

Defines that Azion shouldn't cache the response from its origin. The execution of this rule has no impact on the cache in the users' browser, which must be defined using the [Set Cache Policy](#set-cache-policy) behavior.

By using **Bypass Cache**, you'll configure Azion's service to forward all requests to a path directly to their origin. However, you'll count on important protocol optimizations to speed up your application and a keepalive connection between Azion edge nodes and their origin whenever possible.

:::tip
See the guide on [How to configure cache policies for Edge Application](/en/documentation/products/guides/cache-settings/#bypass-cache) for more information on Bypass Cache.
:::

#### Difference between Bypass Cache and TTL 0

While both the **Bypass Cache** behavior and **Maximum TTL** at zero seconds allow you to optimize content delivery and reduce load times at the origin, their effects are a bit different.

By using the Bypass Cache behavior, all HTTP and HTTPS requests received by Azion's edge nodes will be sent to the origin, without caching any content. Use Bypass Cache if you want to deliver different content for each user request.

However, when setting TTL to 0 (zero) seconds, multiple requests in parallel to Azion's edge nodes will be sent as a single request to their origin. In this case, Azion's edge nodes also validate changes to the content with its origin by using the *If-Modified-Since* parameter. If the object hasn't changed since the last request, the content won't need to be transferred again, which could result in a much faster *304 Not Modified* response. Also, setting maximum cache TTL to 0 will still generate a cache object that lives for 999 milliseconds.

:::tip
You can set TTL to zero if the dynamic content, which varies from time to time, can be delivered identically to all users who make simultaneous requests.
:::

### Capture Match Groups
<Badge>Request Phase</Badge>
[<Badge variant="accent">Requires Application Accelerator</Badge>](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/application-accelerator/)

Support behavior for handling strings. Stores in a temporary variable the result of capturing correspondence groups defined by a regex applied to one of the available HTTP request fields. This temporary variable can be referenced later in the behavior *Rewrite Request* to assemble the rewrite string.

This behavior requires three arguments:

- *captured array name*: the name you want to give to the temporary variable where the array of captured strings will be stored.
- *subject*: the HTTP request field where you want to capture a string.
- *regex*: the regular expression used to capture the strings. Each captured group must be represented in parentheses.

For example, to capture the path and name of a file in an HTTP request, you could use:

- *captured array name*: `capture`
- *subject*: `${uri}`
- *regex*: `^(./)([^/])$`

You may reference the capture variable as an array by using the notation `%{variable[index]}`. Because it's a local variable, you can only use it within the same rule you are setting up. In this example, if the URI is `/path/image.jpg`, the capture variable will have the following values:

- `%{capture[0]} = "/path/image.jpg"`
- `%{capture[1]} = "/path/"`
- `%{capture[2]} = "image.jpg"`

You can also name the indexes to reference them using names instead of a numeric index. To do so, use the `?&lt;name&gt;` notation as in the example:

- *captured array name*: `capture`
- *subject*: `${uri}`
- *regex*: `^(?<path>.*/)(?<filename>[^/]*)$`

### Deliver
<Badge>Request Phase</Badge> <Badge>Response Phase</Badge>

Finishes processing the request and delivers the content to the user, without executing any of the rules added later. You're forcing the processing to end immediately.

### Deny (403 Forbidden)
<Badge>Request Phase</Badge>

Delivers a *403 Forbidden* page to the user. Ends the request processing.

### Enable Gzip
<Badge>Request Phase</Badge> <Badge>Response Phase</Badge>

Enables Gzip data compression, if supported by the user's browser. See the guide on [How to enable gzip compression](/en/documentation/products/guides/gzip-compression/) for more information.

### Enforce HLS cache
<Badge>Request Phase</Badge>
<Badge variant="accent">Requires Live Ingest</Badge>

This behavior is automatically included by Azion every time you select a Live Ingest source. Two actions are performed in this situation: the bypass of all your Cache Phase rules and the imposition of the cache policy defined by Azion for live transmissions in HLS.

Azion's cache policy for live HLS streams is 5 seconds of cache for playlists (`.m3u8`) and 60 seconds of cache for chunks (`.ts`).

### Filter Cookie
<Badge>Request Phase</Badge> <Badge>Response Phase</Badge>
[<Badge variant="accent">Requires Application Accelerator</Badge>](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/application-accelerator/)

Removes a cookie from the request header that would be sent to the origin or from the response header that would be sent to the user. As an argument, add the name of the cookie you want to remove as `cookie-name`.

To remove only specific values, you must inform the name and value of the cookie as `cookie-name=cookie-value`.

### Filter Header
<Badge>Request Phase</Badge> <Badge>Response Phase</Badge>

Removes a request header that would be sent to the origin or a response header that would be sent to the user. The name of the header field must be entered as an argument, for example: `Header-Name`.

### Finish Request Phase
<Badge>Request Phase</Badge>

Finishes the request phase. Any behavior or other rules under this behavior won't be executed.

### Forward Cookies 
<Badge>Request Phase</Badge>
[<Badge variant="accent">Requires Application Accelerator</Badge>](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/application-accelerator/)

By using the Forward Cookies behavior, you're determining that Azion forwards to its users the `Set-Cookie` header received from its origin, even when cached content is identified (HIT).

To prevent a user from receiving the `Set-Cookie` header from another user's session, see the [guide on cache policies](/en/documentation/products/guides/cache-settings/#creating-a-rule-to-forward-cookies-from-the-origin-to-the-user).

#### JavaScript Cookies

An alternative to sending the response header `Set-Cookie` is to create cookies using **JavaScript**, which allows you to create, read, and expire cookies through the `document.cookie` property.

A [JavaScript cookie](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_cookies.asp) should have the following format:

```js
document.cookie = "username=John Doe; expires=Thu, 18 Dec 2020 12:00:00 UTC; path=/";
```

By default, Azion won't filter the request header `Cookie` regardless of its **Forward Cookies** configuration and therefore JavaScript Cookies may be sent to the origin to enable the management of your application.

### No Content (204)
<Badge>Request Phase</Badge>

Returns a `204` code when accessing the edge application instead of the code received from the origin.

### Optimize Images
<Badge>Request Phase</Badge>
[<Badge variant="accent">Requires Image Processor</Badge>](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/image-processor/)

Enables [Image Processor](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/image-processor/).

### Redirect HTTP to HTTPS
<Badge>Request Phase</Badge>
[<Badge variant="accent">Requires HTTPS application</Badge>](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/build/main-settings/)

Redirects the HTTP request to HTTPS. If the request is already made through HTTPS, the behavior isn't executed. 

### Redirect To
<Badge>Request Phase</Badge> <Badge>Response Phase</Badge>

**Redirect to (301 Moved Permanently)** and **Redirect To (302 Found)** redirect the user to the URL or URI entered as an argument, returning the corresponding status code.

It's recommended using these behaviors for path changes; *301 Moved Permanently* for permanent changes and *302 Found* for temporary changes.

Both behaviors end the request processing phase.

:::caution
In the Response Phase, **Redirect To** behaviors are only executed when the origin returns a 404 error.
:::

### Rewrite Request
<Badge>Request Phase</Badge>
[<Badge variant="accent">Requires Application Accelerator</Badge>](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/application-accelerator/)

Modifies the resource path that will be requested for the origin. You can rewrite the resource path using:

- A string.
- The requisition variables (which can also be used in Criteria).
- The local variables, in the format `%{name [index]}`, with the result of capturing strings, when using the auxiliary behavior [Capture Match Groups](#capture-match-groups).

For example, to rewrite a user request for the `/original/image.jpg` resource to be sent to its origin as `/new/image.jpg`:

1. Use the **Capture Match Groups** behavior with the arguments:
 - *captured array name*: `capture`
 - *subject*: `${uri}`
 - *regex*: `/original/(.)`

2. Use the **Rewrite Request** behavior with the argument `/new/%{capture[1]}`.

### Run Function
<Badge>Request Phase</Badge> <Badge>Response Phase</Badge>
[<Badge variant="accent">Requires Application Accelerator</Badge>](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/application-accelerator/)
[<Badge variant="accent">Requires Edge Functions</Badge>](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-functions/)

Runs a function created using **Edge Functions** and instantiated in the **Edge Functions** tab for the edge application. See the guide on [How to run serverless functions](/en/documentation/products/guides/serverless-functions/) for more information.

### Set Cache Policy 
<Badge>Request Phase</Badge>

Assigns the cache policy that should be used for the request. You must first set up the cache policies in [Cache Settings](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/cache-settings/).

You can set up the time that an object will be stored in cache and the rules for the variation of objects in cache with the [Advanced Cache Key](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/cache-settings/#advanced-cache-key). 

### Set Origin
<Badge>Request Phase</Badge>

Assigns an origin that must be consulted by the edge node for the request.

Before configuring this behavior, you must set up your origins using [Origins](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/origins/).
