The **WebSocket Proxy** module for Edge Application allows you to establish the WebSocket communication protocol between your origin and your users under the reverse proxy architecture. This type of protocol consists of a single bidirectional TCP connection that allows data to be exchanged in real time via a single handshake without the need to restart the connection.

WebSockets are designed to minimize latency and increase efficiency, and are suitable for applications that exchange data in real time, such as online games, chat platforms, notifications, and live streaming services. See the [WebSocket protocol specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6455) for more information.

:::note
At the moment, this module is exclusively accessible to subscribers of the **Enterprise** and **Mission Critical** Service Plans. For further details on Azion's service plans, see [Pricing](/en/pricing/#plans).
:::

Due to their nature as a bidirectional open connection, WebSocket Proxy is incompatible with the use of the [Edge Functions](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-functions/) and [Image Processor](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/image-processor/) modules. WebSocket connections won't work in conjunction with [Edge Caching](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-caching/) or [L2 Caching](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/l2-caching/).

## Requirements

Your client and server must support the WebSocket connection natively for the protocol to be implemented in your edge applications. On the client side, most browsers include native WebSocket support. See the [complete list of browsers with WebSocket support](https://caniuse.com/websockets).

### Upgrade headers

The origin application must inject the `Upgrade: websocket` and `Connection: upgrade` HTTP headers for the connection to be successfully established. If the `Connection` and `Upgrade` headers are sent by the client with values other than those specified above or one of them isn't present, the connection upgrade in the user request to the origin won't be carried out.

### Maximum connection time

Azion recycles [keepalive connections](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/#keepalive-timeout) on its servers approximately every *15 minutes*. Therefore, active WebSocket connections may be terminated if they exceed this interval. In this case, your application must handle these scenarios and re-establish the connection whenever necessary.

## Error treatments

By default, an edge application that has the **WebSocket Proxy** module enabled will consider any request received with the headers `Upgrade: websocket` and `Connection: upgrade` to be a websocket connection and will forward them to the origin. It's recommended that the application itself controls the headers in cases where the protocol should be used.

A valid WebSocket connection will return the status `101 Switching Protocols`. If this isn't the status received, even if it's among the `2xx` or `3xx` family of success statuses, it's likely that the client request, the edge application, or the origin server didn't complete the Websocket connection. In this case, you should review the [connection upgrade requirements](#requirements) and make the necessary adjustments.
