**Edge Caching** is a module available for **Edge Application** that reduces latency in applications and increases transfer rates through Azion's network of edge nodes.

When your content is successfully cached, also known as a *cache hit*, it can be directly delivered to your users from edge node nearest to them, eliminating the frequency of access to your origin servers. This not only enhances performance and scalability for your content, but also cuts back on infrastructure costs.

In the event of a *cache miss*, when the requested content isn't available in the cache, Azion Edge Caching module minimizes the impact by maintaining a keep-alive connection with the origin server whenever possible. This approach avoids the overhead of frequent TCP/IP handshakes. Irrespective of the number of simultaneous requests made to Azion's Edge Nodes, each edge node only needs to search the content from the origin once per *cache miss*, which reduces the load on your infrastructure.

If origin servers experience downtime or become unavailable, Azion Edge Caching can also serve cached content to your users from the edge. 

With Azion, you can customize the time the cache remains in the edge through *time-to-live* (TTL) values. Cache policies with large TTL values can optimize the performance of your application, improving the experience for your users, reducing traffic with Azion, and reducing the load at your origin. However, a low cache TTL can help you ensure end-users always see the most current information.

## Expiration settings

With Edge Caching, you can customize both browser cache TTL (Time-to-Live) and edge cache TTL according to your specific requirements.

By setting your TTL for browser cache, you can control how long the content remains stored on local browsers. A longer TTL can reduce the need for users to fetch content from the edge or origin servers, improving load times and reducing bandwidth usage.

You can also define how long your content should remain cached on Azion's edge nodes. A longer edge cache TTL can enhance content delivery performance, as frequently accessed content remains available closer to users, reducing the load on the origin server. 

Striking the right balance for cache expiration times is crucial to ensure users receive the most up-to-date content without serving stale cache for too long.

The ability to customize both the browser cache TTL and edge cache TTL allows you to fine-tune your caching strategy based on your content's update frequency, user traffic patterns, and overall performance objectives.

## Stale cache

When your application's cache expires, it becomes *stale* (obsolete) and the server searches the origin for the most up-to-date version. This new version, with an updated expiration date, overwrites the old one (*stale*).

However, the server may encounter problems and be unable to get the most up-to-date version of your application from the origin. When active, **Stale Cache** delivers the latest version of the content in cache, regardless of expiration, whenever origin servers are unavailable.

## Adaptive Delivery 

**Adaptive Delivery** detects device groups you've created using [Device Groups](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/device-groups/), allowing you to configure how Azion delivers your content. You may choose to deliver the same version of the content, regardless of device detection or keep device-based variations of objects in cache.
