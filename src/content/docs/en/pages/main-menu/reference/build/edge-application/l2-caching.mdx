**Tiered Cache** is an **Edge Application** module that creates an additional cache layer between the edge and your origin servers, reducing latency and infrastructure costs.

When accessing your applications on Azion, your end-user accesses the edge network, where your content is cached. By enabling Tiered Cache in Edge Application, you can:

- Cache at a second layer at the edge.
- Keep your content cached for longer periods of time.
- Select the best region to keep cache closer to your users.

:::note
Tiered Cache is only available if the service has been activated for your account. To activate **Tiered Cache**, [contact the Sales team](https://www.azion.com/en/contact-sales/).

## Implementation

| Scope | Resource |
| --- | --- |
| Edge Cache module | [Edge Cache](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-caching/)  |
| Creating a cache setting | [How to configure cache policies for Edge Application](/en/documentation/products/guides/cache-settings/) |

---

## Recommended TTL

**Tiered Cache** is specially designed for objects that can remain in cache for a long period of time. Thus, you can only activate it on cache policies with a TTL equal to or greater than *3 seconds*, with the default TTL being *60 seconds*.

---

## Regions

When you enable **Tiered Cache** as an extra caching layer, the edge servers of this second caching layer are hosted in the US (`na-united-states`) by default. 

Azion also offers the option of hosting the Tiered Cache servers in Brazil (`sa-brazil`). To switch between regions in your edge applications, please contact the [Sales team](https://www.azion.com/en/contact-sales/).

---

## Real-Time Purge

Whenever necessary, you can use **Real-Time Purge** to expire your **Tiered Cache** content before the expected TTL time. Remember to purge first from the tiered cache layer and only later from **Edge Cache**. This avoids edge feedback with outdated Tiered Cache content.

---

## Limits

These are the **default limits**:

| Scope | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Minimum TTL in Tiered Cache¹ | 3 seconds |
| Maximum TTL in Tiered Cache | 2,592,000 seconds |

> ¹ The **Tiered Cache** module currently doesn't support bypass cache. You can [configure a Bypass Cache rule](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/rules-engine/#bypass-cache) for caching at the edge, but applications with active Tiered Cache settings will continue to keep caching in that layer for the specified minimum TTL.
