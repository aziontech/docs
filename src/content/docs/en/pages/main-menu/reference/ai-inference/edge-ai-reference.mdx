**AI Inference** empowers you to build and deploy intelligent applications that process data close to where it is generated. By combining artificial intelligence with edge computing, it eliminates the complexities of scaling and infrastructure management, enabling real-time decision-making and enhanced performance.

With Azion AI Inference, you can seamlessly integrate AI capabilities into your applications, leveraging tools like Functions, Applications, and the Azion API to create scalable, secure, and efficient solutions.

AI Inference gives you access to:

- **Run AI models on Edge Runtime**, enabling advanced AI architectures to execute directly at the edge for minimal latency and maximum performance.
- **Deploy autonomous AI agents** that analyze data and make decisions at the edge.
- **Real-time processing** with reduced latency and enhanced efficiency.
- All as part of a **complete platform**, including Applications, Functions, SQL Database vector search, and more.

### Model customization

AI Inference allows you to fine-tune, train, and specialize models using **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)**. This capability enables you to optimize models for specific tasks, ensuring they are both efficient and accurate for your business needs.

### AI Agents

AI Inference supports deploying AI agents like ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) at the edge, enabling advanced tasks such as context-aware responses, semantic search, and intelligent data processing.

### Integration with SQL Database

Integrate with **SQL Database** to enable vector search capabilities, allowing for semantic queries and hybrid search. This integration enhances AI-powered applications by providing precise, contextually relevant results and supporting efficient Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) implementations.
