**Azion SIEM** allows you to expand the visualization of accesses made to your edge applications. By correlating data available on [Real-Time Metrics](/en/documentation/products/real-time-metrics/) and [Real-Time Events](/en/documentation/products/real-time-events/), you can amplify your analysis of security, access volume, health, degradation, and prediction.
