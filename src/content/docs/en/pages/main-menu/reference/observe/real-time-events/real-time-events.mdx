**Real-Time Events** is an [Observe](/en/documentation/products/observe/) product that provides raw data, *logs*, from other Azion products in real time.

A set of preorganized variables are available to execute queries manually using different data sources. This allows you to get extensive, detailed information on behaviors, occurrences, and performance of your applications through logs.

You can use Real-Time Events to:

- Perform complex searches.
- Inspect possible attacks.
- Perform debugging investigations.
- Analyze application's performance.
- Analyze applications and platform savings.
- Increase reliability of your data.
- Decrease problem-solving time.
- Improve content delivery based on actual data.


## Implementation

| Task | Guide |
| ---- | ----- |
| See first steps | [Real-Time Events first steps](/en/documentation/products/real-time-events/first-steps/) |

---

## Events storage

**Real-Time Events** stores events logs from the last *168 hours*, equivalent to *7 days*. You're able to query detailed data during that period.

The **Activity History** data source stores logs from the last *2 years*.

---

## Data sources 

**Data Source** represents the Azion product or service that generated the events you'll query for. When submitting a query, the data source represents the index from where you want to collect data.

Selecting a data source tab is mandatory. You can choose between:

- HTTP Requests
- Edge Functions
- Edge Functions Console
- Image Processor
- Tiered Cache
- Edge DNS
- Data Stream
- Activity History

Each data source has a specific set of available variables, representing the specific information you can receive in your query. See each data source’s prerequisites and variables and their description next.

:::note
There are two ways to access Real-Time Events logs: via [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com/) interface and via API. This documentation provides the variables exhibited in the interface. You can use the **Real-Time Events GraphQL API** and [check the available fields](/en/documentation/devtools/graphql-api/features/gql-real-time-events-fields/).
