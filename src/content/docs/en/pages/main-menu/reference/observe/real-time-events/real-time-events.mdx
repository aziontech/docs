**Real-Time Events** is an [Observe](/en/documentation/products/observe/) product that provides raw data, *logs*, from other Azion products in real time.

A set of preorganized variables are available to make queries manually using different data sources. This allows you to get extensive, detailed information on behaviors, occurrences, and performance of your applications through logs.

You can use Real-Time Events to:

- Perform complex searches.
- Inspect possible attacks.
- Perform debugging investigations.
- Analyze application's performance.
- Analyze applications and platform savings.
- Increase reliability of your data.
- Decrease problem-solving time.
- Improve content delivery based on actual data.


## Implementation

| Task | Guide |
| ---- | ----- |
| See first steps | [Real-Time Events first steps](/en/documentation/products/real-time-events/first-steps/) |

---

## Events storage

**Real-Time Events** stores events logs from the last *168 hours*, equivalent to *7 days*. You're able to query detailed data during that period.

---

## Data sources 

**Data Source** represents the Azion product or service that generated the events you'll query for. When submitting a query, the data source represents the index from where you want to collect data.

Selecting a data source in the dropdown menu is mandatory. You can choose between:

- [Data Streaming](/en/documentation/products/data-streaming/)
- [Edge Applications](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/)
- [Edge Functions](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-functions/)
- [Edge Pulse](/en/documentation/products/edge-pulse/)
- [WAF Events](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/web-application-firewall/)

Each data source has a specific set of available variables, representing the specific information you can receive in your query. See each data source’s prerequisites and variables and their description next.

## Time filter

The **Time filter** allows you to refine the period for the events record search result. It's selected by default for **Last 15 minutes**.

You can filter by:

- Last 15 minutes
- Last 30 minutes
- Last 1 hour
- Last 3 hours
- Last 6 hours
- Last 12 hours
- Last day
- Last 2 days
- Last 3 days
- Last 5 days
- Last 7 days
- Custom

By using the **Custom** field, you can customize your search by selecting a date and time range during the last *168 hours*.

You can change the time range as many times as you want to investigate your logs.

---

## Filter by

In the **Filter by** field, you filter your search results by using a keyword or phrase. This makes your search more specific and makes it easier to find the logs you want to analyze.

By submitting a search with a blank **Filter by** field, you'll get all existing records for the variables of the selected data source available during the selected time filter.

The field uses SQL language to query results. Your search must be in one of two formats:

`key='value'`

- Exact match, where:
    - `key`: one of the variables from the data source you're querying for.
    - `=`: means the search must query for the exact value passed.
    - `value`: a value of either string or integer format.

`key like '%value%'`

- Similar value, where:
    - `key`: one of the variables from the data source you're querying for.
    - `like`: means the search must query for a similar value to the one passed.
    - `%value%`: a value of either string or integer format surrounded.

In the second format, you can use with `value`:

    - `%value%`: filters for values that contain the entire specified value.
    - `%value`: filters for values that end with the specified value. 
    - `value%`: filters for values that begin with the specified value.

You can also search for more complex queries with the `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` notations to combine the fields.

Some examples of SQL queries:

| Variable | SQL query |
| -------- | --------- |
| $status | `status='404'` |
| $status + $scheme | `status='200' AND scheme='https'` |
| $endpoint_type | `endpoint_type='datadog'` |
| $geoloc_country_name | `geoloc_country_name='Brazil'` |
| $message_content | `message_content like '%unavailable%'` |
| $message_content | `message_content like '%available%'` |

:::note
You can't use the `timestamp` variable as a key in your search, as you'll query the time in the **Time filter** field.
:::

---

## Data exhibition

After you complete the filters and search for results, your logs will appear in a table.

Each line is a different log, which equals to a different action performed by the edge. If you click on a log, the line will expand and provide more detailed information about it. The information shown varies according to the specifics of each variable.

The interface paginates for a given amount of results at first, but it'll continue to load all available results as you scroll through the page.

---

## Refresh

After performing a query, you can use the **Refresh** button to update the returned data. **Real-Time Events** will repeat the last search performed, updating the data but keeping the time filter and the SQL filter you used.

If you had the **Last 30 minutes** time filter, for example, and it was 4:00, you'd have logs from 3:30-4:00. If you use the **Refresh** button at 4:45, you'll have logs from 4:15 P.M-4:45.

The search continues to return the results ordered by most recent to oldest.

---

## Limits

Depending on the size of your data, the query limit may exceed. If this happens, filter by a short time filter.
