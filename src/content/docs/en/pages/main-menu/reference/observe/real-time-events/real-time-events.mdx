**Real-Time Events** is an [Observe](/en/documentation/products/observe/) product that provides raw data, *logs*, from other Azion products in real time.

A set of preorganized variables are available to execute queries manually using different data sources. This allows you to get extensive, detailed information on behaviors, occurrences, and performance of your applications through logs.

You can use Real-Time Events to:

- Perform complex searches.
- Inspect possible attacks.
- Perform debugging investigations.
- Analyze application's performance.
- Analyze applications and platform savings.
- Increase reliability of your data.
- Decrease problem-solving time.
- Improve content delivery based on actual data.


## Implementation

| Task | Guide |
| ---- | ----- |
| See first steps | [Real-Time Events first steps](/en/documentation/products/observe/real-time-events/first-steps/) |

---

## Events storage

**Real-Time Events** stores events logs from the last *168 hours*, equivalent to *7 days*. You're able to query detailed data during that period.

The **Activity History** data source stores logs from the last *2 years*.

---

## Data sources 

**Data Source** represents the Azion product or service that generated the events you'll query for. When submitting a query, the data source represents the index from where you want to collect data.

Selecting a data source tab is mandatory. You can choose between:

- HTTP Requests
- Functions
- Functions Console
- Image Processor
- Tiered Cache
- Edge DNS
- Data Stream
- Activity History

Each data source has a specific set of available variables, representing the specific information you can receive in your query. See each data source’s prerequisites and variables and their description next.

:::note
There are two ways to access Real-Time Events logs: via [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com) interface and via API. This documentation provides the variables exhibited in the interface. You can use the **Real-Time Events GraphQL API** and [check the available fields](/en/documentation/devtools/graphql-api/features/gql-real-time-events-fields/).

| HTTP Referer | Address of the page the user made the request from. Example: `https://example.com` |
| HTTP User Agent | End user’s application, operating system, vendor, and/or version. Value of the `User-Agent` header. Example: `Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)` |
| Request Length | Request length in bytes, including request line, headers, and body. This field is the result of a sum. Example: `167` |
| Request Method | HTTP request method. Example: `GET` or `POST` |
| Request Time | Request processing time, in seconds, since the first bytes were read from the client. This field is the result of a sum. Example: `0.234` |
| Request Uri | URI of the request made by the end user, without the host and protocol information and with arguments. Example: `/v1?v=bo%20dim` |
| Remote Address | IP address of the origin that generated the request. Example: `127.0.0.1` |
| Remote Port | Port of the origin that generated the request. Example: `8080` |
| Scheme | Request scheme. Example: `HTTP` or `HTTPS` |

| Status | HTTP status code of the request. Example: `200` |
| Upstream Addr | Client’s IP address and port. Can also store multiple servers or server groups. Example: `192.168.1.1:80`. When the response is `127.0.0.1:1666`, the upstream is [Azion Cells Runtime](/en/documentation/runtime/overview/). |
| Upstream Bytes Received | Number of bytes received from the origin by the edge if the content isn’t cached. Example: `8304` |
| Upstream Bytes Sent | Number of bytes sent to the origin. Example: `2733` |
| Upstream Cache Status | Status of the local cache. Can be: `MISS`, `BYPASS`, `EXPIRED`, `STALE`, `UPDATING`, `REVALIDATED`, `HIT`, or `-` |
| Upstream Response Time | Time it takes for the edge to receive a default response from the origin in seconds, including headers and body. Example: `0.876`. **In case of cache, the response is `-`** |
| Upstream Status | HTTP status code of the origin. If a server can't be selected, the variable keeps the 502 (Bad Gateway) status code. Example: `200`. **In case of cache, the response is `0`** |
| Waf Block | Informs whether WAF blocked the action or not. `0` when action wasn’t blocked; `1` when action was blocked. When in *Learning Mode*, it won’t be blocked regardless of the return. |
| Waf Ev Headers | When the request headers sent by the user are analyzed by the WAF module and tagged as **blocked** with `$waf_block = 1`, it contains a base64 encoded string. Otherwise, it contains a dash character `-`. It applies to both WAF *Learning* or *Blocking* modes. |
| Waf Learning | Informs if WAF is in Learning mode. Returns `0` if it isn't and `1` if it is. |
| Waf Match | List of infractions found in the end user’s request. It’s formed by key-value elements: the *key* refers to the type of violation detected; the *value* shows the string that generated the infraction. Example: `0:1402:HEADERS:cookie` |
| Waf Score | Reports the score that will be increased in case of a match with the rules set for the WAF. Can be `SQL`, `XSS`, `TRAVERSAL` or `RFI`. |
| Waf Total Blocked | Total number of blocked requests. Example: `2` |
| Waf Total Processed | Total number of processed requests. Example: `5` |

The `Stack Trace` variable can be used if you have the **Debug Rules** feature activated in your application. Find out more on [How to debug rules created with Rules Engine](/en/documentation/products/guides/debug-rules/).

:::note
The `Set WAF [Your WAF]` Firewall behavior performs special processing, allowing other rules to be processed simultaneously. As a result, logs may display other rules in the `traceback` field, even if the WAF Rule Set is configured to block and return the request.  However, the WAF rules operate correctly, blocking requests that match the specified criteria. This behavior is standard for the platform.
