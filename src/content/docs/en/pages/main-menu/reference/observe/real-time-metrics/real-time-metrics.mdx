**Real-Time Metrics** is an [Observe](/en/documentation/products/observe/) product that provides you with real-time access to metrics, through charts, so you can analyze the events of your applications and products configured on Azion. It also helps you optimize the use of Azion products and how your content is delivered.

By analyzing data through Real-Time Metrics, you can check and track the behavior of your applications in near real time. Real-Time Metrics gives you the opportunity to:

- Gain insights on the performance of your application.
- Examine the availability of your content.
- Quantify accesses and traffic to your content.
- See bandwidth savings.
- Find security threats in real time.
- Troubleshoot problems in real time.
- Compare your application's data through different data intervals.

Real-Time Metrics fetches your data and metrics using [Azion GraphQL API](/en/documentation/products/graphql-api/) and generates charts based on its response.

You can combine your metrics analysis with [Real-Time Events](/en/documentation/products/real-time-events/) to further inspect your logs.

See the [first steps for Real-Time Metrics](/en/documentation/products/real-time-metrics/first-steps/).

## Grafana plugin

Real-Time Metrics also has an [Azion Grafana plugin](https://github.com/aziontech/grafana-plugin) integration available for local installation. With it, you can use Grafana’s interface to create dashboards and complement your metrics visualization.

Your dashboards can be created using GraphQL queries. You can use it to view and create:

- Top X metrics (such as IP addresses or blocked countries).
- Security metrics.
- Customized alerts.
- Specific status codes.

See how to:

- [Customize your own dashboard](/en/documentation/products/guides/azion-plugin-grafana/)
- [Use use a pre-built dashboard to view Data Transferred graphs](/en/documentation/products/guides/azion-plugin-grafana-pre-built-dash/)

## Data storage

Azion stores your metrics' events and logs for 2 years, but the new Real-Time Metrics provides data and metrics starting from **October 15th, 2022**.

If you want to view metrics for up to 2 years and before October 15th, 2022:

## Data consideration

When comparing the data displayed on Real-Time Metrics and Azion Billing data, you may find differences. Real-Time Metrics focuses on performance, using an at-most-once approach, while Billing seeks precision, using an exactly-once approach. If you find such differences, you should consider Azion Billing data as the correct one.

On average, the difference between the two is smaller than 1%. See [Azion Pricing](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/) and the [Billing documentation](/en/documentation/products/accounts/billing/) for more information.

## Product choice to view metrics

**Real-Time Metrics** allows you to analyze your applications' metrics through several products, indicated by separate tabs according to their category. You can choose to visualize your metrics through the following categories:

- Build
- Secure
- Observe

After selecting the category you want, you can select a product to view metrics.

On the **Build** tab, you'll find metrics related to:

- Edge Application
- L2 Caching
- Edge Functions
- Image Processor

On the **Secure** tab, you'll find metrics related to:

- WAF
- Intelligent DNS

On the **Observe** tab, you'll find metrics related to:

- Data Streaming

After selecting one of the category tabs and the product tab, you'll see the available charts for that specific product according to the data on your account. If you select Data Streaming, for example, you'll see charts related to the data streamings configured in your account.

Some products, such as **Edge Application**, can also have subtabs, which separate different types of metrics for the same product. Each set of charts composes a dashboard. Find out more about each tab, subtab, and charts in the [Metrics' monitoring with charts](#metrics-monitoring-with-charts) section.

You must subscribe and activate the following products to view their metrics:

- <Badge>Data Streaming</Badge>
- <Badge>Edge Functions</Badge>
- <Badge>Intelligent DNS</Badge>
- <Badge>Image Processor</Badge>
- <Badge>L2 Caching</Badge>

## Data interval

After you decide which product you'll be analyzing, you need to configure a data interval to fetch data for your charts.

On **Real-Time Metrics'** screen, just before the section with the charts, you find the date interval filter, with two parts:

- **Time range**: options to select the time period you want to use to exhibit data on your charts. By default, it comes with the **Last Hour** range selected, but you can choose between:

  - Last Hour
  - Last 24 Hours
  - Last 7 Days
  - Last 30 Days
  - Last 6 Months

When you select **Last Hour**, Real-Time Metrics automatically refreshes your data every one minute.

- **Date calendar**: calendar field with the date and time of your chosen time range. When you select a time range, it automatically sets the begin and end dates. If you want to use a different time range, you need to manually set up the beginning and ending dates in the calendar fields.

The timezone used is the same as the one configured in your user preferences.

After you configure the **Time range** and **Date calendar** fields, your charts are refreshed to fetch the data related to the new configured data interval.

## Filters

import Filters from "~/includes/docs_help_center/en/real-time-metrics/edge-applications/data-transferred/adding-filters/index.md"

<Filters />

:::tip
After you apply a filter, the URL path on RTM is updated with an encoded parameter. You can copy and share it with other users so they can view the charts with the same filters applied.
:::

---

## Chart view

On the second section of **Real-Time Metrics**, after the configuration filters, you find all the available charts.

:::note
The last point of the graph may appear as a downward metric. This occurs because the last data are still being aggregated, and thus appear to be dropping. For example: it's 3:40 PM now and you've requested data for the last 3 days. The data from 3-4 PM is still being calculated and aggregated, so the graph visualization may seem to have drop in the metrics.
:::

Each chart displays the following properties:

- **Title**: descriptive name for the graph.
- **Type of chart**: tag representing who created the chart and to whom it's available for.
    - **Azion Chart**: chart displayed by default by Azion's servers.
- **(?) Get help**: tag that opens a Help Center article, which you can use to discover more about each chart and find a few tips and practical examples.
- **Context menu**: extra options of actions related to the chart.
    - **Copy Query**: to copy the query of that specific chart to your clipboard.
    - **Export CSV**: to download and export the points presented on that specific chart according to the data displayed.
    - **Show Mean Line/Hide Mean Line**: to exhibit or stop exhibiting the average value of the chart. Each point of the chart is summed and divided by the total number of points, generating a mean for the data shown on that specific chart and time period.
- **Description**: a short text that explains what data that specific chart displays.
- **Aggregator**: type of aggregation being used in the query to generate the metrics on the chart. Either `Sum` or `Avg`.
- **Variation tag**: information shown on chart with only one series. It provides a percentage comparing the previous and current values of the chart in the corresponding time period. The tag shows a **+** if the current value is larger, a **-** if the previous value was larger, and no sign if the value is the same. Example: if you're using the "Last hour" period and it's 10:00, the chart shows data for the period from 9:00-10:00, and the feedback will show a comparison with the data from 8:00-9:00.
- **Graph series**: representation of data categories.
   - Example: in a line graph that shows the number of requests over time, you can have several series, each one representing a different domain. Each series will have data points connected by a line to exhibit how the number of requests varied over time for each domain.
- **Tooltip**: information available by hovering the cursor over the graph series, which displays the value and the name of each series of that specific point in a descending order, according to the value. This feature isn't available for viewports smaller than 540px.
- **Time interval line**: the x-axis of the graph, representing the time period line for the data on the graph.
- **Legend**: a list that reflects and describes series and data from the y-axis, based on the chart's aggregation type. You can select and deselect each legend item to change the data displayed on the graph.

Legends can be displayed differently according to the type of chart and amount of series represented on it. They can appear on the *bottom* of the chart or on the *right side*, and the legend exhibits a maximum of *16 series* per graph.

:::note
When you use the **Copy Query** button and paste it on the [GraphQL playground](https://manager.azion.com/metrics/graphql), you need to move what's exhibited under "VARIABLES" to the "**QUERY VARIABLES**" section, on the bottom of the page.

## Metrics' monitoring with charts

In the second section of Real-Time Metrics, right after the data interval filter, you find all the available charts for your account.

Even after you configure a data interval filter, you can still navigate through tabs and change the product you want to view metrics from. After you select a tab and, possibly, subtab, you can analyze your data for each chart.

Next, you can find detailed information about each tab and subtabs and about each of the charts available:

- [Build](#build)
    - [Edge Applications](#edge-applications) _-_ [L2 Caching](#l2-caching) _-_ [Edge Functions](#edge-functions) _-_ [Image Processor](#image-processor)

- [Secure](#secure)
    - [WAF](#waf) _-_ [Intelligent DNS](#intelligent-dns)

- [Observe](#observe)
    - [Data Streaming](#data-streaming)
