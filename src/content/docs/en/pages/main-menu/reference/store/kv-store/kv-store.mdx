## Overview

KV Store is a distributed key–value storage service that runs across Azion’s edge network. It lets you persist and retrieve small pieces of data with very low latency from anywhere your users are, without managing servers.

Typical use cases include:

- Session and authentication tokens
- User preferences and personalization
- Caching API responses and computed fragments
- Rate-limit counters and idempotency keys
- Shopping cart or draft state

---

## How it works

- Data is organized into namespaces that contain independent sets of keys.
- Each item is addressed by a key that is unique within its namespace.
- Values can be stored as text, JSON, or binary/streaming payloads.
- Data is replicated across Azion edge nodes to maximize availability and read performance.
- Single-key operations are atomic per key. Multi-key transactions are not supported.

## Business rules

## Data resilience

KV Store uses a distributed architecture with replication across Azion edge nodes. New writes are accepted at the edge and propagated to replicas to ensure durability and high availability. Reads are served from the closest healthy replica to minimize latency.

---

## Namespaces

A namespace is an isolated key space. Use namespaces to segment data by application, environment, or workload.

Recommended patterns:

- Separate namespaces for production and staging.
- Prefix keys to model hierarchy, for example: users/123/profile, flags/new-ui, carts/region-br/user-42.
- Keep keys short and meaningful; prefer a few path-like segments over long opaque identifiers.

Naming:

- Names must be unique within your account.
- Use lowercase letters, numbers, dashes, and underscores.

## Interacting with KV Store via Functions

(Create, Read, Update, Delete) 
The examples below illustrate common patterns.


```js
const aqui=1
```

---

## Methods

- put(namespace, key, value, options?)
  - value: string | object (JSON) | ArrayBuffer | ReadableStream
  - options: { metadata?: object, contentType?: string }
  - returns: void
- get(namespace, key, options?)
  - options: { type: 'text' | 'json' | 'arrayBuffer' | 'stream' }
  - returns: string | object | ArrayBuffer | ReadableStream
- delete(namespace, key)
  - returns: void

---

## Limits

These are the **default limits**:

- Per-key write rate: up to 1 write per second to the same key.
- Key size: up to 512 bytes (UTF‑8).
- Metadata size: up to 1024 bytes (JSON-serialized).
- Value size: up to 25 MB per item.

These are the **default limits** for each Service Plan:

| Scope | Developer | Business | Enterprise | Mission Critical |
| ----- | --------- | -------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| Namespaces | 10 | 50 | 200 | 200 |
| Maximum file size | 200 MB | 500 MB | 2 GB | 2 GB |
| Maximum storage per account | 5 GB | 50 GB | 300 GB | 300 GB |
