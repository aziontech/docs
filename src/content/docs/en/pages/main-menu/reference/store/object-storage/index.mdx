Azion **Edge Storage** is a scalable and secure storage service designed to integrate object storage with the Azion Edge Computing Platform using the S3 standard for object transactions. 

Edge Storage allows you to create buckets, which can be used as origins for edge applications or as directories for real-time object upload. Alongside bucket creation, you possess complete control over storage allocation. This includes management of read/write permissions and the ability to upload, change, and delete objects.

:::note
This product is available through the [Azion API](https://api.azion.com), [Edge Runtime](/en/documentation/devtools/runtime/overview/), and [Azion CLI](/en/documentation/products/azion-cli/overview/).

## Buckets

Buckets are the system used to organize stored objects. Similar to folders, buckets are the top-level containers to store objects. All buckets created with Azion **Edge Storage** are stored in the *us-east* cloud server.

Bucket names must be unique and range between 6 and 63 characters. Alphanumeric characters and hyphen (`-`) are accepted. Bucket names must not start with `azion`.

Best practices for naming buckets include specifying what types of objects are stored and the type of permissions for the objects. For example, a bucket for an edge application `Banking App` in read-only mode could be named `banking-app-ro`.

### Authentication and permissions

Actions involving buckets, such as uploading, listing, and deleting objects, always require authentication through the Azion account.

In addition to the required authentication, some transactions are restricted by bucket permissions. The permissions available are:

- **Read-only**: objects in the bucket can be read but not modified.
- **Read-write**: objects in the bucket can be modified.
- **Restricted**: objects in the bucket can be modified and read but can't be accessed by the Azion Edge Platform. Buckets can't be modified using Edge Runtime or CLI and can't be used as an origin for edge applications.

Personal and sensitive information shouldn't be uploaded to the bucket or in object due to encryption limitations for privacy protection.

## Objects

Objects, or files, can be uploaded, modified, downloaded, and removed from buckets using the [Azion REST API](https://api.azion.com), [Edge Runtime](/en/documentation/devtools/runtime/overview/) and the [Azion CLI](/en/documentation/products/azion-cli/overview/).

### Object key

An object key is a string of characters that composes a unique identifier for objects stored in **Edge Storage** buckets. Through the available tools, users can retrieve a file stored in a bucket by using its object key.

The object key isn't required to match the original file path or name from the local storage from which it was retrieved, nor contain the original file extension. However, when uploading a local file to a bucket, it's recommended to attribute the object key after the file to match local storage conventions. For example, for the local file `folder/file.png`, the object key should be the same.

The object key cannot be changed. Uploading a different object or modifying object contents using an existing key replaces the object. Once an object is replaced, earlier versions can't be retrieved.

### Prefix

A prefix is a combination of paths that simulate a folder hierarchy. Since buckets can't be organized into folders, you can use the forward slash (`/`) when creating keys to categorize objects in your bucket into a prefix.

For instance, the list of keys below represents the simulated hierarchy of an application stored in a bucket with prefixes:

```bash
README.md
src/index.js
src/index.html
src/assets/styles.css
src/assets/images/image.png
```

The object `README.md` is located at the root of the bucket. The `src` prefix corresponds to a folder and contains the objects `index.js` and `index.html`. Additionally, the `src/assets` prefix contains a `styles.css` object and the `src/assets/images` prefix, in turn, contains the `image.png` object.

When creating an edge storage origin, you can set a prefix to serve to the edge. For instance, using the example above, you can create an origin that only serves the `image.png` object by setting the prefix to `src/assets/images`.

---

## Origin

With **Edge Storage**, you can use buckets as an [origin](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/origins/#edge-storage) in Azion **Edge Application** to retrieve the content of an edge application.

You can determine if the content is retrieved from the root of the bucket or from a prefix within the bucket.

## Transactions

A transaction refers to an exchange between a client and **Edge Storage**. Any action related to buckets and objects (create, delete, list, and update) is considered a transaction. Each time one of these methods is used, a transaction is logged. 

All transactions are available in the [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/#cc7b8b24-4a82-4f70-8660-40e17f6d5440) documentation.

:::note
Transactions are charged by classes. If a transaction falls outside of the scope of class A operations, it'll be billed to your account. For more information on transaction and class charges, see the [Pricing](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/) page.
:::

Transaction history can be accessed through [Real-Time Events GraphQL API](/en/documentation/products/graphql-api/features/events-fields/#activityhistoryevents-activity-history).

The current release of the **Edge Storage** offers the following transactions:

| Class | Transaction name | HTTP method |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | [Post Object](#post-object) | `POST` |
| A | [Put Object](#put-object) | `PUT` |
| A | [Delete Object](#delete-object) | `DELETE` |
| A | [Delete Bucket](#delete-bucket) | `DELETE` |
| B | [Get Object](#get-object) |  `GET` |
| C | [List Objects](#list-objects) | `GET` |
| C | [Create Bucket](#create-bucket) | `POST` |
| C | [List Buckets](#list-buckets) | `GET` |
| C | [Update Bucket](#update-bucket) | `PATCH` |

:::note
Class A transactions require read-write permission for the bucket.

### Post Object

Uploads an object to a bucket.

Use the `--data-binary` option in the cURL command to send raw binary data, such as images or complex files without undergoing URL encoding.

You must specify the MIME type of the object being sent in the body using the `Content-Type` header. For example, objects with the `.txt` extension should contain the `Content-Type: text/plain` header. Alternatively, use the `application/octet-stream` MIME type to indicate that the data is a binary stream and the server should handle it as raw binary data.

Sending a new object with an object key that already existed in the bucket will replace the previous object.

### Put Object

Uploads an object to a bucket.

Sending a new object with an object key that already existed in the bucket will replace the previous object.

### Delete Object

Removes an object from a bucket.

When you delete an object that is being served on the edge, it will immediately stop being served and will no longer be listed in the bucket.

### Delete Bucket

Removes a bucket from an account.

Buckets that contain objects cannot be deleted. After removing the final object from a bucket, there is a 24-hour period before the bucket can be deleted.

### Get Object

Retrieves an object from a bucket

Add the `-O -J` options to the cURL command to download the object to your device using this transaction.

### List Objects

Retrieves a list of objects loaded into a bucket.

This transaction returns details of all objects in the bucket, including the size in bytes and the timestamp of the last modification.

### List Buckets

Retrieves a list of buckets associated with an account.

### Create Bucket

Creates a new bucket for an account.

### Update Bucket

Modifies bucket information.

Use this transaction to change the access permissions to the objects in the bucket. Buckets cannot be renamed with this transaction.
