Azion **Edge Storage** is a scalable and secure storage service designed to integrate object storage with the Azion Edge Platform using the S3 standard for object operations. 

Edge Storage allows you to create buckets, which can be used as origins for edge applications or as directories for real-time object upload. Alongside bucket creation, you possess complete control over storage allocation, bucket and object access management, as well as the ability to upload, change, and delete objects.

:::note
This product is available through the [Azion API](https://api.azion.com) and [Edge Runtime](/en/documentation/devtools/runtime/overview/).

## Buckets

Buckets are the system used to organize stored objects. Similar to folders, buckets are the top-level containers to store objects. Buckets can be created using the [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/#5fc02ebd-a8f7-4b49-9ef9-549054040ae2).

All buckets created with Azion **Edge Storage** are stored in the *us-east* cloud server.

Bucket names are exclusive between all Azion accounts. Names must range between 6 and 63 characters and must not start with `azion`. Alphanumeric characters and hyphen (`-`) are accepted.

Best practices for naming buckets include specifying what types of objects are stored and the type of permissions for the objects. For example, a bucket for an edge application `Banking App` in read-only mode could be named `banking-app-ro`.

---

## Objects

Objects, or files, can be uploaded, modified, downloaded, and removed from buckets using the [Azion API](https://api.azion.com), [Edge Runtime](/en/documentation/devtools/runtime/overview/), and the [S3 protocol](#s3-protocol-compatibility).

### Object key

An object key is a string of characters that composes a unique identifier for objects stored in **Edge Storage** buckets. Through the available tools, users can retrieve a file stored in a bucket by using its object key.

The object key isn't required to match the original file path or name from the local storage from which it was retrieved, nor contain the original file extension. However, when uploading a local file to a bucket, it's recommended to attribute the object key after the file to match local storage conventions. For example, for the local file `folder/file.png`, the object key should be the same.

The object key cannot be changed. Uploading a different object or modifying object contents using an existing key replaces the object. Once an object is replaced, earlier versions can't be retrieved.

### Prefix

A prefix is a combination of paths that simulate a folder hierarchy. Since buckets can't be organized into folders, you can use the forward slash (`/`) when creating keys to categorize objects in your bucket into a prefix.

For instance, the list of keys below represents the simulated hierarchy of an application stored in a bucket with prefixes:

```bash
README.md
src/index.js
src/index.html
src/assets/styles.css
src/assets/images/image.png
```

The object `README.md` is located at the root of the bucket. The `src` prefix corresponds to a folder and contains the objects `index.js` and `index.html`. Additionally, the `src/assets` prefix contains a `styles.css` object and the `src/assets/images` prefix, in turn, contains the `image.png` object.

When creating an edge storage origin, you can set a prefix to serve to the edge. For instance, using the example above, you can create an origin that only serves the `image.png` object by setting the prefix to `src/assets/images`.

### Origin

With **Edge Storage**, you can use buckets as an [origin](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/origins/#edge-storage) in Azion **Edge Application** to retrieve the content of an edge application.

You can determine if the content is retrieved from the root of the bucket or from a prefix within the bucket.

## Operations

An operation refers to any exchang of data between a client and **Edge Storage**. Any and all actions related to buckets and objects, such as create, delete, list, and update, is considered an operation. Each time one of these methods is used, either through the API or the S3 protocol, an operation is logged. 

All operations are available in the [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/#565230b1-5f75-49e5-b025-0dc9e271883d) documentation.

:::note
Class C operations are free. If an operation falls out of the scope of class C operations, it'll be billed to your account according to the established costs. For more information on operation and class charges, see the [Pricing](/en/documentation/products/pricing/) page.
:::

The current release of the **Edge Storage** offers the following operations:

| Class | Operation name | HTTP method | S3 capability |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | [ListObjects](#listobjects) | `GET` | `listFiles`<br />`listBuckets`* |
| A | [CreateBucket](#createbucket) | `POST` | – |
| A | [ListBuckets](#listbuckets) | `GET` | `listAllBucketNames` |
| A | [UpdateBucket](#updatebucket) | `PATCH` | – |
| B | [GetObject](#getobject) | `GET` | `readFiles` |
| C | [PostObject](#postobject) | `POST` | – |
| C | [PutObject](#putobject) | `PUT` | `writeFiles` |
| C | [DeleteObject](#deleteobject) | `DELETE` | `deleteFiles` |
| C | [DeleteBucket](#deletebucket) | `DELETE` | – |

> \* If `listBuckets` is enabled, when attempting to retrieve files that aren't in the bucket using an S3 credential, the proper `404 Not Found` status response returns instead of a `403 Forbidden` status. Find out more about S3 capabilities in [S3 protocol compatibility](#s3-protocol-compatibility).

### PostObject

Uploads an object to a bucket.

:::tip
For API cURL requests, use the `--data-binary` option in the command to send raw binary data, such as images or complex files without undergoing URL encoding.
:::

For the **Azion API**, you can specify the MIME type of the object being sent in the body using the `Content-Type` header. For example, objects with the `.txt` extension should contain the `Content-Type: text/plain` header. If the MIME type isn't specified, **Edge Storage** will attempt to interpret the file type based on the file extension. Alternatively, use the `application/octet-stream` MIME type to indicate that the data is a binary stream and the server should handle it as raw binary data.

Sending a new object with an object key that already exists in the bucket will replace the previous object.

### PutObject

Uploads an object to a bucket.

Sending a new object with an object key that already existed in the bucket will replace the previous object.

### DeleteObject

Removes an object from a bucket.

When you delete an object that is being served on the edge, it'll immediately stop being served and will no longer be listed in the bucket.

:::caution[warning]
For S3 credential access, this operation is allowed through the capability `deleteFiles`, which requires the `writeFiles` capability to be enabled.
:::

### DeleteBucket

Removes a bucket from an account.

Buckets that contain objects cannot be deleted. After removing the final object from a bucket, there is a 24-hour period before the bucket can be deleted.

### GetObject

Retrieves an object from a bucket.

:::tip
For API cURL requests, add the `-O -J` options to the command to download the object to your device using this operation.
:::

### ListObjects

Retrieves a list of objects loaded into a bucket.

This operation returns details of all objects in the bucket, including the size in bytes and the timestamp of the last modification.

### ListBuckets

Retrieves a list of buckets associated with an account.

### CreateBucket

Creates a new bucket for an account.

### UpdateBucket

Modifies bucket information.

Use this operation to change the access permissions to the objects in the bucket. Buckets cannot be renamed with this operation.

---

## Authentication and permissions

Operations involving buckets, such as uploading, listing, and deleting objects, always require authentication through the Azion account.

:::note
Go to [Teams Permissions](/en/documentation/products/accounts/teams-permissions/) to know more about **Edge Storage** account permissions.
:::

You can manage two kinds of permissions for your buckets and objects:

- **Bucket permissions**: manage access from the edge and other users to buckets and objects within buckets using the Azion REST API.
- **S3 credentials**: manage access for Azion account users through capabilities and assign operation permissions exclusive to S3 protocol access.

:::caution[warning]
Access permissions set for the bucket are exclusive to REST API operations and S3 access is ruled only by S3 credential permissions. This means that a **PutObject** operation can still be done through the S3 protocol for a bucket set to `read_only` if the credential used includes the `writeFiles` capability. 
:::

### Bucket permissions

In addition to the required authentication and necessary permissions, some API operations can be restricted by bucket permissions. The permissions available are:

- **Read-only**: objects in the bucket can be read but not modified.
- **Read-write**: objects in the bucket can be modified.
- **Restricted**: objects in the bucket can be modified and read but can't be accessed by the Azion Edge Platform. Buckets can't be modified using Edge Runtime and can't be used as an origin for edge applications.

### S3 credentials

**Edge Storage** offers compatibility with the S3 protocol through credentials. 

Credentials can be created for any bucket that you own or for your account as a whole to manage all your buckets. With them, you can control permissions for operations associated with that credential. The permissions for the credential are exclusive to access thorugh the S3 protocol.

To [create a S3 credential](en/documentation/products/guides/s3-protocol-for-edge-storage/), you must use an Azion personal token and run a `POST` request via API. However, after the credential is created, it works independently from your Azion token. This way, even if the token expires, the credential remains valid.

Once a credential is created, an *access key* and a *secret key* are generated, which can be used to set up access to the bucket through the S3 protocol. For security reasons, the *secret key* won't be available after the credential is created. Existing credentials can't be modified in any way.

Once a user's access is verified, they're allowed to make operations depending on the capabilities and permissions set for the credential. 

#### Capabilities

You can assign the following capabilities to S3 credentials:

- `listFiles`: equivalent to [ListObjects](#listobjects), returns a list of objects within the bucket.
- `readFiles`: equivalent to [GetObject](#getobject), returns an object from the bucket through the object key.
- `writeFiles`: equivalent to [PutObject](#putobject), allows modifying files in the bucket through the object key.
- `deleteFiles`: equivalent to [DeleteObject](#deleteobject), allows object deletion through the object key.
- `listAllBucketNames`: equivalent to [ListBuckets](#listbuckets), allows you to list all buckets associated with the account.
- `listBuckets`: if enabled, returns the proper `404 Not Found` response when attempting to retrieve files that aren't in the bucket using the credential.

---

## S3 protocol compatibility

After an [S3 credential](#s3-credentials) is created for a bucket, you can use the S3 protocol (`s3://`) to execute operations according to the [list of capabilities](#capabilities). 

The S3 protocol allows you to access buckets and objects using an Edge Storage URL. This configuration facilitates file operations through command line interface (CLI) tools, such as [s3cmd](https://s3cmd.org), database services, or functions.

You can use the access and secret keys provided by the [S3 credentials API](https://api.azion.com) to set up a connection using the S3 protocol.

<LinkButton link="/en/documentation/products/guides/s3-protocol-for-edge-storage/" label="learn How to access Edge Storage using the S3 protocol" outlined/>

To do so, you'll need the following information:

| Data | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Access key | The credential's access key generated upon creating the S3 credential with the Azion API |
| Secret key | The credential's secret key generated upon creating the S3 credential with the Azion API. This information is confidential and will only be available at the moment of creation |
| Region | The assigned server's region, which is `us-east-005` |
| S3 endpoint | The default S3 address for all operations, which is `s3.us-east-005.azionstorage.net` |
| DNS-style template | The host name template to access the bucket and objects. Can be `bucket+hostname:port/object-key` or `hostname:port/bucket`. <br /><br />For example, for a `file.txt` object in the `my-bucket` bucket, the host names could be: <br /><li><ul>`my-bucket.s3.us-east-005.azionstorage.net/file.txt`</ul><ul>`s3.us-east-005.azionstorage.net/my-bucket/file.txt`</ul></li> |
