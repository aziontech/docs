**Edge SQL** is a Store product that allows you to create and manage distributed database services with low latency. Fully ACID-compliant, Edge SQL is built on top of a database powered by libSQL and works while being replicated across Azion edge nodes. A database created on Edge SQL is stored in two types of instances: a **main** instance and its **replicas**.

With Edge SQL, you can:

- Store real-time telemetry data, ideal for IoT.
- Manage inventory of distributed e-commerce/retail distribution centers.
- Store and analyze access logs, quickly identifying and mitigating security attacks.
- Store and manage access data.

There are two ways to build a database through Edge SQL: using the Edge SQL REST API or writing an edge function. The REST API allows you create, read, list, and delete databases. An edge function allows you to write on a database.

### Implementation

| Scope | Resource |
| ----- | -------- |
| Manage databases with REST API | []() |
| Create queries | []() |
| Write on a database with an edge function | []() |

## Business rules

Writing databases, through REST API or edge function, is only possible in the [main instance](#main-instance). All [replicas](#replicas) are read-only.

:::caution[warning]
Once you delete a main instance, this action can't be undone. You'll still be able to read the replicas, but won't be able to write on them.
:::

During the creation of a database, especially your first one, there's a propagation time for it to be created on the edge nodes. Your `POST` request response will exhibit a `creating` state, and you can run `GET` requests to check once it's created.

:::note
if you receive a `creation_failed` state, try creating the database again or contact the [support team](/en/documentation/services/support/#service-channels) to check.

## Data resilience

With a distributed architecture running across Azion edge nodes, Edge SQL guarantees data is kept safe and available. Your data is created in a main instance and propagated through replicas across Azion edge nodes.

---

## Instances

### Main instance

The primary storage instance, it receives all *write* commands and synchronizes the received data with the replicas.

All databases](#databases) are created and all [queries](#query) are written on the main instance. After the automatic process handled by Azion, your data is processed on edge locations, snapshots are created, and merged into replicas.

:::caution[warning]
It's recommended to always create a backup of your [main instance](#main-instance) to guarantee your data is safe. As there's a propagation time which differs for the replicas, it's best to backup the main rather than the replicas.
:::

### Replicas

Replicas are *read-only* copies of the main instance. Replicas are updated within different propagation time, so they'll eventually be in sync in the main instance, but it doesn't occur instantly. The replication process occurs automatically through Azion back-end systems, in which snapshots are created and then merged in each replica.

They handle data storage, processing, and management in proximity to the devices reading the data, helping with data distribution, availability, and low latency.
