The **Security Response Team (SRT)** is a managed service designed to control and mitigate workload failures and DDoS attacks. The SRT is available 24x7 and can be activated during or after a DDoS attack to help track incidents, ascertain the root cause, and implement solutions alongside your business. You may also mobilize the SRT for post-attack analysis.

Customers with **Enterprise** or **Mission Critical** Service Plans have an hour package available for purchase and can request this service by contacting the [Sales](https://www.azion.com/en/contact-sales/) and Customer Success teams. 

For more detailed information, see [Azion Service Plans](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/#plans).
