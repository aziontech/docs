The **Managed Configurations** service provides management and control over your Azion edge infrastructure. This service employs the expertise of a team of experienced engineers to tackle certain day-to-day tasks on your behalf, such as setting up and maintaining your configurations.

The Managed Configuration service is operated by **Solution Architects**, who are responsible for implementing configuration changes requested by you, as the Azion customer. To request the Managed Configuration service for applications running on Azion, [open a Support Ticket](https://tickets.azion.com/en/support/login).

Each request for this service accounts for one configuration change. See [Pricing](/en/documentation/products/pricing/) for more information on how this service incurs charges.
