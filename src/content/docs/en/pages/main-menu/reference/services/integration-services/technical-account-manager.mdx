The **Technical Account Manager (TAM)** is your technical touchpoint. The TAM acts as a consultant, proactively providing strategic technical guidance to help accelerate the digital transformation and edge computing journey, and provide insights to maximize infrastructure investment (on-premises and/or in the cloud).

They also help with the use, performance, and security of the applications executed and delivered by Azion, minimizing the risks involved during deployment and updates of settings and applications. All this comes with the support of an Azion Specialist for your IT and business teams to improve the development, security, delivery, performance, reliability, observability, and cost optimization of your applications running on Azion and to keep them operationally healthy.
