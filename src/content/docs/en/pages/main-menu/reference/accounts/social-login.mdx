**Social Login** is an option of single sign-on that uses existing information from a social network to log in to third-party sites without the need to create a new login account for that particular site. It links accounts from one or more social networking services to a site, simplifying end users' logins and providing increasingly reliable information.

**Social Login** provides a number of advantages, such as:

* Pre-validated email.
* Agility in the access process.
* Ease of use for mobile devices.
* Simple and faster user registration process by eliminating the manual sign-up process.

In addition, it helps prevent users from providing false data or forgetting their login information.

> Currently, Azion supports Social Login with GitHub and Google accounts.
