The **User Session Timeout** feature allows you to define a **maximum idle time**, ensuring that sessions are automatically terminated after a period of inactivity. It also allows you to define a **maximum session time** to avoid sessions staying open indefinitely. This implementation increases the platform's security, protecting sensitive user data and preventing unauthorized access due to prolonged sessions.

By using this feature, you're able to:

- Configure a maximum idle time and session timeout to attend to compliance and security policies.
- Guarantee users' sessions and data are protected.

:::note
When an organization sets up the User Session Timeout, it applies to all account levels.

This feature is available for customers of all the [Azion Service Plans](https://www.azion.com/en/professional-services/).

### Maximum idle time

**Maximum idle time** refers to the period of inactivity after which a session is automatically terminated. It's defined by any API call or interface interaction within a session; if the time since the last access meets or exceeds the configured idle time, the session the session will expire, and the user will be logged out.

If the idle time setting is updated, active sessions will automatically conform to the new policy. For instance, if the idle time is reduced, sessions created before the update must follow the new duration and may be terminated if needed.

The idle time must range between *1 minute* and the *configured maximum session time*. The value must be in *minutes*.

By default, the maximum idle time allowed is *1440 minutes*, equivalent to *1* day.

### Session time

**Maximum session time** limits the total time a session can remain active, regardless of activity, ensuring sessions don't stay open indefinitely.

If the maximum session time setting is updated, active sessions will automatically conform to the new policy. For instance, if the maximum session time is reduced, sessions created before the update must follow the new duration and may be terminated if needed.

The time for this setting should be between *5 minutes* and *15 days*. The default value is *21600*, equivalent to *15 days* in minutes. The value must be in *minutes*.
