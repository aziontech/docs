**Personal Tokens** are a string of characters used to authenticate your user and access to certain interfaces and tools. You can create a long-lived authentication personal token in [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/) to call [Azion APIs](https://api.azion.com/) or to execute commands in the [command-line interface (CLI)](/en/documentation/products/cli/).

While creating a personal token, you'll have to provide:

- **Personal Token name**: descriptive and easy-to-remember name.
- **Expires in**: date of expiration for the token. You can choose the token expiration date between *1*, *7*, *15*, *30*, *90 days*, *1 year*, or a *custom date*.
- **Personal Token description** (optional): description to help you remember why the token was created and/or what it was created for.

:::tip
The Personal Token's expiration date should be chosen according to your project needs and duration. For use with APIs and CLI, for example, you can create a long-lived authentication token for practicality but you may have to be more careful and take extra security measures.
:::

You can only see your token when you first create it. After clicking the **OK** button, your token *can no longer be seen or copied* and you won't be able to access it again. Treat your tokens like passwords and save them in a safe place right after you create them.

You can create as many personal tokens as you like and you can view them under the **Personal Tokens** option in the **Account Menu**, located in the top-right corner of **RTM**. You can’t modify a token once it's created, but you'll be able to see its *scope*, *last modified date*, and *expiration date*.
