**Single sign-on (SSO)** allows you to give your team members one account for all the systems your company uses. If you have an **Enterprise** or **Mission Critical** Service Plan and have SSO configured for your company, your users can log in to Azion's plataform using their SSO credentials.

Only users with *Account Owner* status can configure team member login settings using one of two account authentication options: **Azion SSO** or an external **Identity Provider (IdP)**.

By using SSO, you can:

- Reduce password-related issues.
- Enhance security, minimizing potential vulnerabilities.
- Reduce support requests, since the user manages fewer passwords.
- Enable seamless navigation between apps.

## Identity Provider

An IdP is a trusted entity that allows you to enable SSO to access other sites or services, such as Azion. Your users can continue using their corporate user identities without having to remember a specific password or enter credentials each time they access Azion's platform. Microsoft Entra is an example of an IdP.

---

## Service Provider

Azion, in this context, is the service provider configured as an application in an identity provider to enable SSO.

## Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)

The Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an open standard protocol for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties, in particular between an Identity Provider and a Service Provider. SAML is an XML-based markup language for security statements (statements that service providers use to make access control decisions). Azion supports the SAML protocol, version 2.0.

## OpenID Connect (OIDC)

The OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an open standard identity protocol that uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication and authorization, and then builds identities that uniquely identify users.

## System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM)

The System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) is an open standard that streamlines user identity management across systems, enabling automated account creation, updates, and deletion between identity providers and service providers.
