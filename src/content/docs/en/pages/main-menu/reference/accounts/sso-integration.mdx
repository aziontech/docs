Single sign-on (SSO) allows you to give your team members one account for all the systems your company uses. If you have an Azion Enterprise account and have SSO configured for your company, your users can log in to **Real-Time Manager (RTM)** using their SSO credentials.

Only users with *Account Owner* status can configure team member login settings using one of two account authentication options: **Azion SSO** or an external **Identity Provider (IdP)**.

By using SSO, you can:

- Reduce password-related issues.
- Enhance security, minimizing potential vulnerabilities.
- Reduce support requests, since the user manages fewer passwords.
- Enable seamless navigation between apps.


## Implementation

| Task | Guide |
| ---- | ----- |
| Configure Azure SAML| [Using Azure AD custom SAML app as an IdP for Real-Time Manager](/en/documentation/products/guides/sso-azure-saml/) |
| Configure Google SAML | [Using Google custom SAML app as an IdP for Real-Time Manager](/en/documentation/products/guides/sso-google-saml/) |

## Identity Provider

An IdP is a trusted entity that allows you to enable SSO to access other sites or services, such as Azion. Your users can continue using their corporate user identities without having to remember a specific password or enter credentials each time they access RTM. Azure is an example of an IdP.

---

## Service Provider

Azion, in this context, is the service provider configured as an application in an identity provider to enable SSO.

---

## Security Assertion Markup Language

The Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an open standard protocol for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties, in particular between an Identity Provider and a Service Provider. SAML is an XML-based markup language for security statements (statements that service providers use to make access control decisions). Azion supports the SAML protocol, version 2.0.

---

## OpenID Connect

The OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an open standard identity protocol that uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication and authorization, and then builds identities that uniquely identify users.
