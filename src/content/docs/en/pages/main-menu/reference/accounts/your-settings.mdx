## Security settings

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: this is an extra layer of security you can activate in your account. 

> If the main account doesn't have the MFA enabled and your user has this permission, you can only enable it for use in your login. However, if the MFA is already enabled, you can't edit this option. See more about it on the [Multi-Factor Authentication](/en/documentation/products/accounts/multi-factor-authentication/) page.
