Each Azion product and services has specifc metrics that are calculated according to pre-defined characteristics and rules. They're charged based on usage and monthly.  

## Edge Application

### Data Transferred

Based on usage. Considers total volume of content traffic in registered applications during a month. Charges per gigabytes (GB) of content delivered in all applications in an account taking into account (a) the traffic between users or devices and Azion; and (b) the traffic when retrieving the content from the origin server.

Practical examples:

- X GB of traffic with content delivered directly by the edge
- X GB of traffic with content delivered directly by the edge + X GB of traffic with looked for on the origin

### Requests

Based on usage. Considers total amount of requests made to registered applications during a month. Charges per million of requests in all applications in an account independently of the origin response.
