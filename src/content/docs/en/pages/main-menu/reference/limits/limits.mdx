This reference documentation covers the user **limits** for Azion Products and their respective **quotas** for each **Service Plan**.

Limits are technical and functional capabilities of Azion's architecture and infrastructure.

:::tip
All Azion limits are customizable. If you need to increase the standard availability, contact the [sales team](https://www.azion.com/en/contact-sales/).
:::

Quotas are usability shares defined by the product. These values represent the allocation or distribution of specific resources. Quota values are based on the contracted Service Plan.

## Quotas

Quotas are defined by the Azion product being used and the service plan contracted. If a product, module, or feature doesn't have specified quotas, they run on a usage-based approach, meaning you pay as you use them.

### Build

#### Edge Application

[Edge Application](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/) product, modules, and features usage **quotas** per account, according to each service plan:

| Scope | Quota for Developer Plan | Quota for Business Plan | Quota for Enterprise Plan | Quota for Mission Critical Plan |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Maximum number of edge applications | 10 instances | 50 instances | 200 instances | Customizable |
| Maximum number of domains per edge application | 10 instances | 50 instances | 200 instances | Customizable |
| Maximum purge operations per month | 1,000 | 1,000* | 1,000* | 1,000* |

*\ The first 1000 purge operations per each month are included for all customers. After exceeding this volume, users will pay for each 1,000 additional purges.
