This reference documentation covers the user **limits** for Azion products and their respective **quotas** for each **Service Plan**.

Limits are technical and functional capabilities of Azion's architecture and infrastructure. These values must be respected to avoid abuse, misuse, and unrealistic charges.

Quotas are usability shares defined by the product. These values represent the allocation or distribution of specific resources. Quota values are based on the contracted Service Plan.
