**Azion Marketplace** is a digital catalog that makes it easy to find, test, and deploy edge-running software. With a wide range of options, you can quickly deploy new edge applications based on [templates](#azion-templates) or use [integrations](#azion-integrations) to improve, compose, or customize your applications.

As a digital catalog, it allows developers to implement a solution that meets their requirements, providing resources that can be used both inside and outside the **Azion Edge Platform**.

Additionally, Azion Marketplace provides a way for Azion to easily distribute the templates and integrations developed by the team, as well as allowing Independent Software Vendors (ISVs), software developers, and open-source communities to distribute software to an audience of thousands of buyers.

Azion Marketplace offers several advantages:

- **Wide range of options**: the available catalog covers different use cases and functionalities, such as security, performance, databases, artificial intelligence, and more.
- **Streamlined deployment and management**: in a few steps, you can discover, deploy, and configure templates or integrations that can be easily integrated into your existing infrastructure.
- **Time and effort optimization**: by deploying ready-to-use code, you save time and effort. Additionally, you can easily scale your applications and services across a global network of edge servers, without requiring extensive manual setup.
- **Improved performance and user experience**: by leveraging Azion's network, applications using Marketplace ready-to-use resources benefit from reduced latency and faster response times.
- **Enhanced security**: Azion offers products and services to protect your digital assets and mitigate threats, including bot management, validation, tokens, DDoS protection, web application firewalls, and more.

## How Azion Marketplace works

**Azion Marketplace** provides options to speed up your workflow: from development and deployment to management and monitoring. This includes [pre-built templates](#azion-templates) to deploy a new project from scratch and [integrations](#azion-integrations) to increase the capabilities of your applications and services.

By accessing [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/), you find the ideal option to attend to your needs. You can select it, complete the setup, and deploy it.

## Azion Templates

**Azion Templates** are pre-built and pre-configured projects designed to quickly create and deploy new edge applications attending to a variety of use cases.

## Azion Integrations

**Azion Integrations** allow you to improve, compose, or customize your applications, adding new functionalities and capabilities. These integrations are based on edge functions that can be triggered by specific events and execute specific tasks.

### Types of integrations

In Azion Marketplace, you'll find integrations that run edge functions in two ways: by using [Edge Firewall](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/) or by using [Edge Application](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/). The Edge Firewall functions are focused on network security, authentication, and traffic control, while Edge Application functions are best fit to process data or run services on the edge, closer to the user.

Check [Azion’s guides page](/en/documentation/products/guides/#marketplace) for more details on the installation for type of integration.

## How-to guides

Each solution may have different configurations and dependencies to be installed and for them to work adequately. To find out how to configure a specific solution and be able to install it successfully, go to the [Azion's guides page](/en/documentation/products/guides/#marketplace) and select the guide related to the solution you want to use.

## Marketplace’s permissions

In order to use Marketplace properly, some templates and integrations will need permissions or comply to certain requirements. This happens because they could have have semi-auto installations or work with third-party integrations.
