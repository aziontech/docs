Azion **Bot Protection** uses advanced algorithms and *Reputation Intelligence* to analyze the behavior of incoming data. This enables the detection of suspicious behavior, facilitating the implementation of preventive measures against malicious activities such as credential stuffing, vulnerability scanning, and site scraping.

This integration assigns a score based on rules and behaviors. If the score exceeds a predetermined threshold, the integration executes the predetermined action to deny, drop, or redirect the request. 

By using **Bot Protection**, you can:

- **Enhance user experience**
    - Reducing the impact of bots on the web infrastructure.
    - Providing bot protection by IP reputation.
    - Defining custom rule management to act on individual bots based on previous content extraction activity from requests.

- **Increase visibility**:
    - Measuring the amount and characteristics of the bot traffic trying to access your website and applications.
    - Exporting your logs, integrating your SIEM, or using the observability tools provided by Azion to monitor the malicious activity.
    - Combining other integrations to enhance Bot Protection eficiency, through use of fingerprint, captchas, JavaScript injection, or SDKs, to create robust rules.

- **Reduce financial risk**
    - Protecting your website and applications against credential abuse, card balance verification, and other forms of online fraud.

## How Azion Bot Protection works

Azion **Bot Protection** is *serverless* integration available at Azion **Marketplace**.

This integration is based on an edge funtion that runs on **Edge Firewall**. This type of function takes advantage of the features of Azion **Edge Firewall** and **Rules Engine** to protect your network, applications, and resources from security threats, including bad bot signatures or scripted bots. 

/// GRÁFICO ///

request > Edge Firewall > Executa Function > Entrega score > Human or good Bot > request permitida > Logs
<br/>
                                                            se for um Bad bot > action definida > logs

////

1. When a request arrives at a domain using Bot Protection, the Edge Firewall executes the function.
2. After the analysis, the function defines the score for that request, based on a predefined group of rules.
3. If the score is equals or higher to the predetermined treshold, the predefined action is executed.

Azion **Bot Protection** is able to execute **5 different actions** whenever the request's score is greater or equals the defined threshold:

- `allow`: allows the continuation of the request.
- `deny`: delivers a standard *Status Code 403* response.
- `drop`: terminates the request without a response to the user.
- `redirect`: allows the request to be redirected to a new URL/Location when the security threshold is reached. 
- `custom_html`: allows customized HTML content to be delivered to the user in case of a threshold violation.

The function also can POST the requested data to any compatible system with HTTP Receiver Protocol, allowing export the logs, as well as integration with SIEM and other Azion integrations and products. 

### Use cases

**Bot Protection** was deveoped by Azion to attent to uses cases envolving common practices of malicious bots and traffic.

- Reputation Intelligence

## Features

Azion **Bot Protection** is composed by different features that you can take advantage. 

### Reputation Intelligence

By using *Reputation Intelligence*, Bot Protection stablishes an additional security perimeter, cataloging the inbound and outbound traffic, based on **Network Lists**. Through these lists, Bot Protection is able to identify the profile of each request trying to reach your site, including location, device type, and browsing patterns.

Network Lists used by **Bot Protection** includes criterias such as:

- Tor Exit Nodes
- Reputation
- Proxies
- Malware
- Fraud

### Bot classification

With the scrores and Reputtation Intelligence, the integration is able to classificate diffet types of bots and traffic. 

- Legitimate

- Good bots
    - Social Network Bot
    - Monitoring Bot
    - Aggregator Bot
    - Enterprise Bot
    - Search Engine Bot

- Bad Bots
    - Bad Bot Signatures
    - Malicious Intent Detected
    - Scripted bots
    - Malicious Browser Behavior
    - Reputation Intelligence

### Device identification

Using Fingerprint, SDK and JavaScript injecting to identification.

### Redirect
One of the actions Bot Protection is able to execute is `redirect`. It allows the request to be redirected to a new URL/Location when the security threshold is reached. To enable this action, you must declare the variables as in the example:

```json
  "action": "redirect",
  "redirect_to": "http://xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/"
```

Where:

- `redirect_to`: defines the new URL/Location to redirect the requests. If this field isn't filled or it's filled with a value that isn't a *string*, the function will behave as if the `allow` action were enabled.

### Custom HTML

- `custom_html`: allows customized HTML content to be delivered to the user in case of a threshold violation. To enable this action, you must declare the variables as in the example:

```json
  "action": "custom_html",
  "custom_html": "This should be the custom HTML content",
  "custom_status_code": 418,
```

Where `custom_html` defines the HTML content to be delivered and `custom_status_code` the Status Code to be delivered.

- If `custom_html` isn't filled or it's filled with a value that isn't an *string*, the function will behave as would happen with the `allow` action enabled.
- If `custom_status_code` isn't filled or it's filled with a value that isn't a *number*, the default value will be a *Status Code 200*.

### Modes

Azion **Bot Protection** allows you to define the environment in which the function is expected to run, being API or an web application the possible modes.

The default mode is `web`. If any value other than the string "api" (case-sensitive in lowercase) is provided, the "web" mode will be used.

By enabling the `api` mode, no "Set-Cookie" will be performed, and any rules related to the use of cookies in Bot Protection will be ignored. To set this mode, add the following variables in the JSON Args:

```json
"mode": "api",
```

### Export HTTPS logs

JSON export of logs to HTTP endpoint

### SIEM integration

If you require the Bot Protection logs, you may join a SIEM platform to obtain full data. To do so, in the **Arguments** tab, update the function and put in the SIEM connection data.
### SIEM connection example
```json
{
"siem_integration": true,
  "send_data_to_siem_when": "always",
  "siem_connection_args": {
    "host": "example.com",
    "uri": "/inspect/01g43ftztkqgvcr65pjwbr0227",
    "port": "443",
    "scheme": "https",
    "additional_headers": {
      "Authorization": "secret123"
      }
   }
}
```
### Log example
When logs are sent to the SIEM, you'll receive the following information:
```json
{
  "geoip_region": "SP",
  "action": "deny",
  "asn": "396982",
  "request_id": "9581e2b51b5a082b12fed308f4eae564",
  "host": "ojgayey.map.azionedge.com",
  "host": "xxxxxxx.map.azionedge.com",
  "classified": "bad bot",
  "geoip_country": "BR",
  "http_user_agent": "curl/7.87.0",
  "bot category": [
    "Bad Bot Signatures"
  ],
  "request_uri": "/a",
  "remote_addr": "34.95.175.91",
  "score": 8
}
```
