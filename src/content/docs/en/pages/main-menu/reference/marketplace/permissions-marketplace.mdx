To install and deploy templates or integrations from Azion, you may have to grant privileges for **Marketplace** to read and write the configurations of your edge applications.

---

## Common permissions for integrations

Every integration has its own needs for privileges. For example, to read and write the **Rules Engine** of your edge application in order to create a rule to trigger the execution of the integration.

### Main Settings

The **Main Settings** tab on your edge application includes the main configurations needed to execute your integrations. When a integration asks for privileges to write and read **Main Settings**, this means this integration needs to read and/or write one of the following configurations on your edge application:

- **Functions**
    - Must be enabled in order to execute any integration from **Marketplace**. To do so, it's mandatory to allow access if you want to run any integration installed via **Marketplace**. It's used to change the viewer request/response, customize arguments (**Args**) for your functions, and choose *criteria* to execute in **Rules Engine**.
- **Application Acceleration**
    - This option will be mandatory if your integration needs to use advanced rules on **Rules Engines**, such as `Bypass Cache` or `Forward Cookies`.
- **Image Processor**
    - It helps to optimize the experience with images on your edge application.
- **Load Balancer**
    - A traffic balancer to assure you the best-on-class reliability and network congestion control.

:::note
Some integrations on Azion Marketplace may require the L2 Caching module. Contact the [Azion Sales team](https://www.azion.com/en/contact-sales/) to activate this module for your account.

### Rules Engine

Every edge application relies on **Rules Engine** in order to execute the *behavior* and *criteria* you need to run the application on the edge. For this, Azion **Marketplace** needs the privileges to read and write your rules on Rules Engine.

### Edge Firewall

Some integrations will run on the **Edge Firewall** instance. These integrations will need more privileges than granted to an edge application. To know the **Edge Firewall** access privileges, visit the documentation for [Teams Permissions](/en/documentation/products/accounts/teams-permissions/).

## Common requirements for templates

To guarantee the optimal performance of certain templates, some Azion products must be activated in your account and you must enable them separately via RTM. If these products are activated, the execution of the templates could generate usage-related costs. Check the [guides by template](/en/documentation/products/guides/#azion-templates) and the [pricing page](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/) for more information.

Additionally, some templates work with third-party tools to provide a more comprehensive and modern solution. Using this type of template will require compliance with certain requirements such as creating an account or initial setup. In some cases, this integration could generate cost by usage.
