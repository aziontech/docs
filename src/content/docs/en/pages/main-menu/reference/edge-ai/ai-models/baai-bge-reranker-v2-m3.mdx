## Usage 

### Rerank example

This is an example of a basic rerank request using this model:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  http://endpoint-url/rerank \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "model": "BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3",
        "query": "What is deep learning?",
        "documents": [
          "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers",
          "The weather is nice today",
          "Deep learning enables computers to learn from large amounts of data",
          "I like pizza"
        ]
}'
```

### Score example

This is an example of a basic score request using this model:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  http://endpoint-url/score \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "model": "BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3",
        "text_1": "What is deep learning?",
        "text_2": [
          "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers",
          "The weather is nice today",
          "Deep learning enables computers to learn from large amounts of data",
