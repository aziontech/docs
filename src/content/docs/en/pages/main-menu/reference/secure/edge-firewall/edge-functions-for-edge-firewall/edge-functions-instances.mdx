By activating the **Functions** module, you can instantiate serverless functions in your **Firewall** at Azion, as well as set up the conditions for its execution. Available for **Application** and **Firewall** products, its use allows you to run serverless functions in our robust distributed network of **Edge Nodes**, responding to events closer to the end user, ensuring greater scalability and availability.

## How it works

In **Firewall**, you will have to activate the **Functions** module, so it is possible to use existing functions provided by Azion Marketplace. For example:

- Bot Manager Lite
- Secure Token
- JWT

When instantiating an **Function**, it is not possible to change its source code, just inform the arguments that will be passed to the context of the function's execution, in *JSON*, through the **Args** tab.

:::note
The **Args** field in **Functions Instance** supports a maximum of 100KB of arguments.

To associate an execution trigger, you simply need to associate the instance with a **Behavior** of a **Rules Engine** Rule, in Request. Thus, when a request meets the criteria defined in the **Rules Engine** rules, the **Function** will be invoked and executed directly on Azion's Edges Nodes.
