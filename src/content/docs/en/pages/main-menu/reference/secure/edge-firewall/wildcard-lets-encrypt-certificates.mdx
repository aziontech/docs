SSL/TLS certificate management is fundamental to ensuring secure connections between clients and servers. In the context of distributed, high-availability environments like those offered by Azion, managing multiple certificates can become complex and costly. Wildcard certificates issued by Let's Encrypt allow you to protect a domain and all its subdomains with a single certificate, significantly simplifying this management.

This documentation demonstrates how using Let's Encrypt wildcard digital certificates can simplify certificate management for Azion customers, providing automation, security, and scalability.

## What are Wildcard Certificates?

A wildcard certificate is a type of SSL certificate that covers not only the main domain but also all its subdomains. For example, a certificate issued for `*.example.com` will protect:

- `www.example.com`
- `blog.example.com`
- `store.example.com`
- And any other subdomains

By using a wildcard certificate, there's no need to issue and renew individual certificates for each subdomain, which simplifies administration and reduces the risk of inconsistent configurations.

## Advantages of Let's Encrypt Wildcard Certificates

### Certificate Management Simplification

- **Reduced Number of Certificates**: A single certificate can cover all subdomains, eliminating the need to manage multiple certificates.
- **Automated Renewal**: Issuance and renewal are performed automatically by the Azion platform, ensuring security isn't compromised by unmanaged expirations.
- **Reduced Rate Limit Risks**: By potentially generating fewer different certificates for subdomains, the mechanism helps reduce the probability of hitting Let's Encrypt service issuance limits.

### Time and Resource Savings

- **Fewer Manual Configurations**: Certificate consolidation makes configuration and maintenance simpler, freeing up IT team time to focus on other demands.
- **Cost Reduction**: Obtaining and maintaining free Let's Encrypt certificates eliminates costs associated with paid certificates and the administrative complexity of multiple renewals.

### Scalability and Flexibility

- **Ease for Dynamic Environments**: In scenarios where new subdomains are created frequently (for example, microservices or development/test environments), wildcard certificates offer the necessary flexibility to keep up with this evolution without requiring constant adjustments.
- **Integration with Azion Platform**: Centralized certificate management, integrated with the Azion platform, enables rapid and secure deployment, plus renewal automation.

## Automated Issuance on Azion Platform

On Azion, Let's Encrypt certificate issuance is fully automated, using the DNS-01 challenge for domain validation. By choosing this solution, customers have native integration that eliminates the need for manual intervention in creating DNS TXT records.

### Automated Issuance Process

#### 1. DNS Zone Configuration

For automatic issuance to work, the customer's DNS zone must be configured and active in [Azion Edge DNS](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-dns/). This configuration allows the platform to have full control over the DNS records needed for validation.

#### 2. Validation via DNS-01 Challenge

During the issuance process, the Azion platform automatically generates the TXT record required for the DNS-01 challenge. This entry is inserted into the DNS zone automatically, without requiring additional actions from the customer.

#### 3. Certificate Issuance

With validation completed automatically, the wildcard certificate is issued and made available for use on all subdomains of the main domain. This centralized approach results in fewer certificate issuances, helping to reduce the risk of hitting Let's Encrypt service issuance limits.

## Integration and Centralized Management

The Azion platform natively integrates certificate issuance and renewal, centralizing the entire process and providing more efficient management.

### Complete Automation

Once the DNS zone is properly configured in Azion Edge DNS, management of the TXT records needed for the challenge is done automatically. This eliminates the need for manual manipulation and reduces configuration error risks.

### Monitoring and Renewal

Azion performs continuous monitoring of issued certificates. When renewal approaches, the platform initiates the validation process again and automatically updates the certificate, ensuring connection security remains uninterrupted.

### Reduced Issuances

By centralizing wildcard certificate issuance and management, the platform minimizes the number of different certificates generated, which in turn reduces the probability of hitting Let's Encrypt issuance limits.

### Deployment Ease

Integration with Azion's management environment enables certificates to be easily associated with customer domains and subdomains, maintaining consistency and compliance with security policies.

## Final Considerations

Adopting Let's Encrypt wildcard certificates, combined with Azion platform's automated issuance, offers a robust and economical solution for simplifying certificate management. By integrating the DNS-01 challenge validation process with centralized DNS zone management in Azion Edge DNS, companies can achieve a more secure, efficient, and scalable infrastructure, minimizing manual interventions, optimizing resources, and reducing risks associated with Let's Encrypt service issuance limits.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q1: What happens if the customer's DNS zone isn't configured in Azion Edge DNS?

**A1**: If the DNS zone isn't active on the Azion platform, issuance automation won't be possible and the validation process must be performed manually. It's essential that the DNS zone is correctly configured to take advantage of automation.

### Q2: How does automation ensure certificate security?

**A2**: Automated issuance eliminates the risk of manual failures in creating TXT records, ensuring that DNS-01 challenge validation is performed correctly and securely, maintaining the integrity of the renewal process.

### Q3: How does automation reduce the risk of hitting Let's Encrypt service limits?

**A3**: By using wildcard certificates to cover all subdomains, the Azion platform potentially generates fewer different certificates. This reduction in the number of issuances decreases the chance of exceeding limits imposed by the Let's Encrypt service.

### Q4: Can I track the status of certificate issuance and renewal?

**A4**: Yes, the Azion platform offers monitoring tools that allow you to track certificate issuance and renewal status, facilitating the identification of possible problems and quick implementation of solutions.
