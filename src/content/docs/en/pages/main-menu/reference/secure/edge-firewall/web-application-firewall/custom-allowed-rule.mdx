**Web Application Firewall (WAF) Custom Allowed Rules** is a feature that allows you to instantiate WAF Rules specifically for the need of your edge application, considering the actual application traffic, request, and data. Use WAF Custom Allowed Rules to amplify the security levels of your application and also to stop false positives.

## Prerequisites

To instantiate **Custom Allowed Rules** in a **WAF Rule Set**, you must have an **Edge Firewall** configuration with the **Web Application Firewall** module activated.

## WAF internal rules

Your **WAF Custom Allowed Rules** can be based on actual requests that were marked by WAF as possible threats. You can also allow a custom rule in case of tests and false positives.

When creating custom allowed rules for a WAF configuration, it's necessary to choose between the available internal rules for its composition. 

See the list of all available internal rules below:

:::caution[Warning]
Requests that fall under rules 1 to 18 will be blocked, even if the WAF is operating in *learning* mode. Read the [Rules Engine for Edge Firewall](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/rules-engine/) documentation for the definition of learning/blocking modes. Read this guide [how to check your WAF mode](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-check-your-waf-mode/).
