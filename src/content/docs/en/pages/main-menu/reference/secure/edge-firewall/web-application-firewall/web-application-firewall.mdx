**Web Application Firewall (WAF)** is an **Edge Firewall** module, developed to protect edge applications from threats such as *SQL Injections*, *Remote File Inclusion (RFI)*, *Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)*, and other web vulnerabilities. WAF analyzes HTTP and HTTPS requests, detects, and blocks malicious activity before it reaches your application infrastructure.

WAF operates in the seventh layer of the OSI model, the application layer, where the relationship between web applications and their respective network services and user data takes place. It also works as a barrier to filter and monitor traffic between your application and the requests from the internet.

**Web Application Firewall** is based on requests *scoring* methodology. Each HTTP/HTTPS request is compared to a very strict and detailed set of application standards and given a *score* that is associated with a particular family of threats. According to the *score* received by the request, it can be released or blocked directly in Azion's edge nodes, before the threat reaches its origin or causes any type of damage. You define the desired level of sensitivity for blocking each family of threats.

WAF can operate in two modes: **Learning** or **Blocking**. You can set the mode in a rule in [Rules Engine](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-firewall/rules-engine/) with the **Set WAF Rule Set** behavior or via [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/#cee49f12-e1d1-4d93-b117-2ef4554121b6).

You can use the **Learning** mode to avoid blocking lawful requests and malfunctions of your application. In this step, WAF identifies the legitimate behaviors of your application by placing them in an *allowlist*.

If internal traffic, tests, and false positives are being blocked by WAF, you can also fine-tune its settings in the **Tuning** feature, available inside a WAF configuration.

## Prerequisites

To configure a **WAF Rule Set**, which is what a WAF configuration is called, you must have an Edge Firewall configuration with the Web Application Firewall module activated.

## WAF Main Settings

The **Main Settings** section is configured by activating protection against specific threat families: SQL Injection, Remote File Inclusions (RFI), Directory Traversal, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), File upload, Evading tricks, Unwanted Access, and Identified Attack, and setting a sensitivity level: Lowest, Low, Medium, High, and Highest.

The **Threat Type Configuration** table categorizes threats into families, according to the purpose of the attack.

<Button href="/en/documentation/products/guides/secure/create-waf-rule-set/" text="go to create a rule set guide" variant="secondary"></Button>

It's possible to enable and disable protection for each threat family individually through the **Active** switch.

**Sensitivity** levels define how strictly WAF will consider a request as a threat. 

Each sensitivity level tolerates a defined number of threat indicatives and the WAF score represents this amount of threat indicatives. The more flexible the sensitivity level is, the higher the WAF score it accepts. The most rigid sensitivity levels, on the other hand, only accept requests with fewer signs of threats.

## WAF Tuning

**WAF Tuning** is an analytical tool that shows IPs from requests that match the WAF rules. The Tuning tab is where you can make the WAF's operation more flexible. IPs are displayed grouped in the **Filter WAF rule** table. You can filter by Domain, Time Range, Network Lists, IP, and Countries.

In the filters below **Filter Possible Attacks**:

1. Enter the domain (required), time range, which network lists you prefer to use, which IPs you are investigating, and the country of origin of the requests.
2. Click the **Apply filter** button.

:::note
To see IPs marked by WAF, you must at least specify the domain (or the domains) of your application. The other fields are optional but enable a more detailed selection.
:::

By clicking the **Apply filter** button, a list of **Possible Attacks** will be displayed. This list includes the fields **Rule ID**, **Description**, **Hits**, **IPs**, **Countries**, **Top 10 IPs Address**, and **Top 10 Countries**.

## Allowed Rules

This tab allows you to create, edit, and delete *Allowed Rules*.

The Allowed Rules are composed of the fields:

| Field              | Description                                                                                                                                                                       |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Rule ID`          | Unique numeric ID of a WAF Rule.                                                                                                                                                     | 
| `Rule Description` | Automatic textual description of what the rule is/does.                                                                                                                           |
| `Reason`           | Alternative manual textual description.                                                                                                                                           |
| `URI`              | *Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)* is the path that goes after the domain in the URL.                                                                                            |
| `Path`             | When specified, restricts the application of the `Match Zone` only to the defined path. The path delimits the scope of action of the rule.                                          | 
| `Match Zone`       | Parts or fields of the requisition that'll be compared with the `match pattern`. It can be `Path`, `Query String`, `Request Header`, `Request Body`, `File Name`, or `Raw Body`. | 
| `Active`           | Allowed Rule active status switch.                                                                                                                                                |

### Match Zone dropdown options

The **Match Zone** dropdown opens the options available to complete this field. Each option has a specific behavior, as explained in the table below.


| Field                        | Description                                                                                                   |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Path`                       | `Match pattern` will be compared with the request path.                                                       |
| `Query String`               | `Match pattern` will be compared to the *query string*, also called `GET arguments`.                          |
| `Request Header`             | `Match pattern` will be compared to the HTTP headers of the request.                                          |
| `Request Body`               | `Match pattern` will be compared to the body of a POST, also called `POST arguments`.                         |
| `File Name` (Multipart Body) | `Match pattern` will be compared with the name of the files in *multipart POSTs* .                             |
| `Raw Body`                   | `Match pattern` will be compared to the uninterpreted body of a requisition, also called the *unparsed body*. |
