**Web Application Firewall (WAF)** is an Azion **Firewall** module, developed to protect applications from threats such as *SQL Injections*, *Remote File Inclusion (RFI)*, *Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)*, *Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)*, *protocol violations* (such as empty body in POST), *Code Injection*, and other web vulnerabilities, including the [most common cyberthreats](https://www.azion.com/en/learning/websec/how-does-waf-protect-against-cyberthreats/#what-are-the-most-common-cyberthreats). WAF analyzes HTTP and HTTPS requests, detects, and blocks malicious activity before it reaches your application infrastructure.

WAF operates in the seventh layer of the OSI model, the application layer, where the relationship between web applications and their respective network services and user data takes place. It also works as a barrier to filter and monitor traffic between your application and the requests from the internet.

**Web Application Firewall** is based on requests *scoring* methodology. Each HTTP/HTTPS request is compared to a very strict and detailed set of application standards and given a *score* that is associated with a particular family of threats. According to the *score* received by the request, it can be released or blocked directly in Azion's edge nodes, before the threat reaches its origin or causes any type of damage. You define the desired level of sensitivity for blocking each family of threats.

WAF can operate in two modes: **Learning** or **Blocking**. You can set the mode in a rule in [Rules Engine](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-firewall/rules-engine/) with the **Set WAF Rule Set** behavior or via [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/#ace1b2f6-253a-48a1-bf58-4c5381e22c21).

You can use the **Learning** mode to avoid blocking lawful requests and malfunctions of your application. In this step, WAF identifies the legitimate behaviors of your application by placing them in an *allowlist*.

If internal traffic, tests, and false positives are being blocked by WAF, you can also fine-tune its settings in the **Tuning** feature, available inside a WAF configuration.

### POST requests and supported content types

When analyzing `POST` requests, WAF only parses the request body when the `Content-Type` header uses one of the following types:

- `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
- `multipart/form-data`
- `application/json`
- `application/vnd.api+json`
- `application/csp-report`

When the `Content-Type` isn’t one of the supported types, the request body may be considered non‑parsable by WAF. This affects how some protocol validation rules are applied, including rules related to validating the `POST` format.

## Prerequisites

To configure a **WAF Rule Set**, which is what a WAF configuration is called, you must have an Firewall configuration with the Web Application Firewall module activated.

## WAF Main Settings

The **Main Settings** section is configured by activating protection against specific threat families: SQL Injection, Remote File Inclusions (RFI), Directory Traversal, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), File upload, Evading tricks, Unwanted Access, and Identified Attack, and setting a sensitivity level: Lowest, Low, Medium, High, and Highest.

The **Threat Type Configuration** table categorizes threats into families, according to the purpose of the attack.

<Button href="/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-firewall/web-application-firewall/rules-set/#threat-types" label="go to types of threats reference" type="primary" theme="light" /> <br></br>

<Button href="/en/documentation/products/guides/secure/create-waf-rule-set/" label="go to create a rule set guide" type="primary" theme="light" />

It's possible to enable and disable protection for each threat family individually through the **Active** switch.

**Sensitivity** levels define how strictly WAF will consider a request as a threat. 

Each sensitivity level tolerates a defined number of threat indicatives and the WAF score represents this amount of threat indicatives. The more flexible the sensitivity level is, the higher the WAF score it accepts. The most rigid sensitivity levels, on the other hand, only accept requests with fewer signs of threats.

<Button href="/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-firewall/web-application-firewall/rules-set/#sensitivity-levels" label="go to sensitivity levels reference" type="primary" theme="light" />

## WAF Rule IDs

Each WAF rule has a unique numeric identifier, called `Rule ID`. 

- **Visibility:** the `Rule IDs` appear on the **WAF Tuning** and **Allowed Rules** screens.
- **Usage:** you can use the `Rule ID` to identify, filter, and allow/block specific behaviors of your application.
- **Full list:** see the description of rule families and their `Rule IDs` in [WAF Rule Sets](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-firewall/web-application-firewall/rules-set/).

### Rule 13: POST format validation

**Rule 13** in WAF is related to validating the format of `POST` requests, ensuring that the request body complies with the message formats defined by HTTP standards.

It considers, among other factors:

- The HTTP method used (`POST`).
- The configured `Content-Type`.
- How the body is serialized (for example, `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `multipart/form-data`, `application/json`).

To understand the expected formats and the semantics of `POST` requests, see:

- [RFC 7231 – Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231)
- [RFC 2388 – Returning Values from Forms: multipart/form-data](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2388)

You can find the detailed description of Rule 13 and its parameters on the [WAF Rule Sets](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-firewall/web-application-firewall/rules-set/) page.

## WAF Tuning

**WAF Tuning** is an analytical tool that shows requests detected for each WAF rule. All matches are displayed grouped by **rule ID**, along with additional information to help in the identification, such as **total hits, number of URIs, unique IPs**, and more to help setup the **Allowed Rules** for the given WAF to match best calibration for your application. You can filter by **Domain**, **Time Range**, **Network Lists**, **IP**, and **Countries**.

<Button href="/en/documentation/products/guides/secure/tune-waf/" label="go to tune WAF guide" type="primary" theme="light" /> 

When selecting a listed Rule shown in the results, you can drill down into the **More Details** screen to view related occurrences for the given Rule ID. This enables you to understand and pinpoint the exact cases that should be added to the **Allowed Rules**, supported by filtering options such as **Network List, Country, IP**, and **Path**.

In the filters below, you can enter the **Domain** (required), **Time Range**, which **Network Lists** you prefer to use, which **IPs** you are investigating, and the **Country** of origin of the requests.

:::note
To see requests identified by WAF, you must at least specify the domain (or the domains) of your application.
:::

By clicking the **Apply filter** button, a list of **Possible Attacks** will be displayed. This list includes the fields **Rule ID**, **Description**, **Hits**, **IPs**, **Countries**, **Top 10 IPs Address**, and **Top 10 Countries**. Now you can select the ones you need and click **Allow Rules** to add them to the Allowed Rules of this WAF.
<Button href="/en/documentation/products/secure/firewall/web-application-firewall/custom-allowed-rules/" label="go to WAF Custom Allowed Rules reference" type="primary" theme="light" />

## Allowed Rules

This tab allows you to create, edit, and delete *Allowed Rules*.

The Allowed Rules are composed of the fields:

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `Rule ID` | Unique numeric ID of a WAF Rule. See the list of rules in [WAF Rule Sets](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-firewall/web-application-firewall/rules-set/). |
| `Rule Description` | Automatic textual description of what the rule is/does |
| `Reason` | Alternative manual textual description |
| `URI` | *Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)* is the path that goes after the domain in the URL |
| `Path` | When specified, restricts the application of the `Match Zone` only to the defined path. The path delimits the scope of action of the rule | 
| `Match Zone` | Parts or fields of the requisition that'll be compared with the `match pattern`. Read more about each option in the [Match Zones table](#match-zone-dropdown-options) below | 
| `Active` | Allowed Rule active status switch |

### Match Zone dropdown options

The **Match Zone** dropdown opens the options available to complete this field. Each option has a specific behavior, as explained in the table below.

| Field | Description | Field example | Matches on |
| ----- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| `Conditional Query String` | `Match pattern` will be compared with query string parameters of the request | `?id=123&user=admin` | You can select to add either the key name or the value in the allowed rule |
| `Conditional Request Body` | `Match pattern` will be compared with the body of the request under certain conditions | `{"username": "admin", "password": "123456"}` | You can select to add either the key name or the value in the allowed rule |
| `Conditional Request Header` | `Match pattern` will be compared with the HTTP headers of the request under certain conditions | `User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/97.0.4692.71 Safari/537.36` | You can select to add either the header name or the value in the allowed rule |
| `File Name (Multipart body)` | `Match pattern` will be compared with the name of the files in *multipart POSTs* | - | - |
| `Path` | `Match pattern` will be compared with the request path | - | - |
| `Query String` | `Match pattern` will be compared to the *query string*, also called `GET arguments` | - | You can select to add either the key name or the value in the allowed rule |
| `Raw Body` | `Match pattern` will be compared to the uninterpreted body of a requisition, also called the *unparsed body* | - | - |
| `Request Body` | `Match pattern` will be compared to the body of a POST, also called `POST arguments` | - | You can select to add either the key name or the value in the allowed rule |
| `Request Header` | `Match pattern` will be compared to the HTTP headers of the request | - | You can select to add either the header name or the value in the allowed rule |
