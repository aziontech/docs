**DDoS Protection** is an [Edge Firewall](/en/documentation/edge-firewall/) module that protects your applications against *Denial of Service (DoS)* and *Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)* attacks, at the network, transport, and application layers (layers 3, 4, and 7 of the OSI model, respectively). 

At Azion, DDoS Protection is **unmetered**. It offers protection against DoS and DDoS attacks with unmetered bandwidth. This means that, no matter how much DDoS attack traffic is directed to your edge applications, or to the Azion infrastructure, the Azion dedicated network will guarantee that all services are constant and not affected by the attack.

It works by running specific algorithms directly on Azion's distributed network to detect small attacks coming from a single IP and large-scale attacks coming from criminal botnet networks. 

The mitigation of DDoS attacks is carried out by Azion and doesn't impact the performance of its applications. Also, it doesn't require specific configuration, but it's possible to configure custom rules for specific detection, mitigation, and targeted attacks.

## Prerequisites

To activate **DDoS Protection - Unmetered** you need to have an Azion **Business**, **Enterprise**, or **Mission Critical** [service plan](/en/documentation/services/service-plans/). The **Developer** plan doesn't offer support for DDoS Protection.

The account type configuration is available at Real-Time Manager (RTM), going to the **Account menu**, located in the upper-right corner. Under **Billing & Subscriptions**, then on the **Subscriptions** tab, at the last section, [Service Plans](https://manager.azion.com/billing-subscriptions/subscriptions).

## DDoS Protection - Unmetered advantages and characteristics

### Always-on mitigation

**DDoS Protection - Unmetered** is *always-on*. It's continuously monitoring network flow by inspecting incoming traffic. It also provides advanced traffic analysis and signature algorithms to detect and block malicious traffic in time and with no impact on your applications.

You can also optimize protection against DDoS attacks at the application layer (layer 7) using the [Web Application Firewall](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/web-application-firewall/), an [Edge Firewall](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/) module.

### Flexible and customizable protection

Azion will be able to apply customized rules to mitigate sophisticated attacks from the network, transport, and application layers. These rules can be applied instantly, allowing you to quickly and efficiently protect your content or application. You can implement custom rules to mitigate specific attacks, using **Edge Firewall** and **Web Application Firewall**.

### Advanced detection

**DDoS Protection - Unmetered** offers advanced detection, inspecting network flows, as well as monitoring each application layer for its resources delivered by Azion using **Edge Firewall** and **Web Application Firewall**. It uses advanced algorithms and *Software-defined Networking (SDN)* for granular detection and mitigation of DDoS attacks, such as **HTTP Floods**, **HTTP Slow Reads**, **DNS Query Floods**, **SYN/ACK Flood**, and many others.

### Mitigation of complex attacks

**DDoS Protection - Unmetered** offers sophisticated algorithms for automated attack mitigation. It's suitable for medium-sized businesses to companies that use Azion in mission-critical systems, with a direct impact on business results, and that want protection against any volume of attack.

### Support for add-ons extensions

**DDoS Protection - Unmetered** has support for *add-ons*, such as **Infrastructure Protection** and **DNS Protection**, which together guarantee the protection of your entire *Autonomous System (AS)* infrastructure and your *Domain Name System (DNS)* service.

#### Protecting your infrastructure with Infrastructure Protection

The **Infrastructure Protection** add-on protects your *Autonomous System Number (ASN)* infrastructure against DDoS attacks. The mitigation of DDoS attacks against your infrastructure is performed using *Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)* and can be activated during an attack or remain always-on.

#### Protection for your DNS with DNS Protection

The **DNS Protection add-on** protects your DNS service from DDoS attacks. By keeping your DNS Master server hidden and spreading Azion's DNS servers to the internet, you'll rely on Azion to ensure the continuity of your services. The Azion DNS service is distributed in many different geographic locations and has protection against DDoS attacks.

Azion's DNS servers get their configuration from the customer's Master server, whether it's inside their infrastructure or in the cloud. If your infrastructure already uses the [DNSSEC](/en/documentation/products/intelligent-dns/dnssec-compatibility/) extension, you can count on DDoS Protection without giving up the guarantee of integrity and authenticity of your records, thus providing security and availability for address resolution for your business.

### Attack visibility

**DDoS Protection - Unmetered** offers complete visibility of application attacks through [RTM](https://manager.azion.com) or [Azion API](https://api.azion.com) to be able to view the attack volume. In conjunction with the **Security Response Team (SRT)**, you'll have access to post-event analysis and investigations.

### Security Response Team (SRT)

**DDoS Protection - Unmetered** offers 24/7 access to Azion's [Security Response Team (SRT)](/en/documentation/services/security-response-team/). The team can be contacted during an attack, after an attack, or even preventively, in the construction of customized rules. This service is available as an add-on for **Enterprise** and **Mission Critical** service plans. Whenever contacted, the SRT will support you in incident triage, root cause identification, and application of necessary mitigations on your behalf.
