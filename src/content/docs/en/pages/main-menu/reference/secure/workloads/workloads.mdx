**Workloads** is an [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com) tool that centralizes communication protocol settings, such as certificates, domains, ports and protocols.

When you [build an edge application](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/build-an-application/), your application is given an automatically generated **Azion Workload**, in the format `xxxx.map.azionedge.net`. You can create multiple Workloads for your edge applications.

If you already own a domain, you can [redirect your traffic to Azion](/en/documentation/products/guides/point-domain-to-azion/) by configuring the records in your DNS provider and listing your **custom domains**.

You may also bind a **Digital Certificate** to domains that use the HTTPS protocol.

## Infrastructure

Select the infrastructure type for your workload. Once this option is saved, it cannot be modified.

- **Production**: production environment of the application. The Azion domain will be in the format `xxxx.map.azionedge.net`.
- **Staging**: environment for testing the application. This configuration won't impact the **Production** environment. The Azion domain will be in the format `xxxx.preview.azionedge.net`.

:::tip
The local `etc/hosts` file maps IP addresses to domains. When you [associate the edge node IP with the CNAME](/en/documentation/products/guides/stage-edge-application-through-hosts-file/) assigned to your domain in your `hosts` file, you force your computer's DNS resolution to access this domain through the edge node and not through public DNS servers. This way, you can stage your application locally as if it were already deployed on your custom domain on the edge before you [point your domain](/en/documentation/products/guides/point-domain-to-azion/) to Azion.

---
## Domains

Manage the domains linked to your application. Ensure proper DNS configuration by mapping CNAME records to the workload domain. You can also use [Edge DNS](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-dns/) to simplify domain management and link your domains to Azion.

### Workload Domain

A Workload domain will be generated upon creating a Workload.

You may restrict access to the default workload domain generated after creating a workload (such as `xxxxx.map.azionedge.net`) by disabling the **Workload Domain Allow Access** switch.

### Azion Custom Domain

Azion Custom Domain lets you set up a custom domain for your application using the format `example.azion.app`.

---
## Deployment Settings

Configure your workload deployment by selecting an [Edge Application](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/) and an [Edge Firewall](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-firewall/). You can also set up [custom error pages](TBD) to handle errors and configure cache time-to-live (TTL) settings based on the HTTP status code returned from the edge connectors.
---
## Protocol Settings

Configure the communication protocols used between the workload and its users. This section allows you to define security, compatibility, and performance settings to optimize how your workload operates at the edge.


- **HTTP**: delivers your application using only the HTTP protocol.
- **HTTP & HTTPS**: delivers your application using both the HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

:::note
If you choose to deliver your application through HTTP & HTTPS, you must associate a [digital certificate](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-firewall/digital-certificates/) to your domain.
:::

#### HTTP/3 support

If you choose to deliver your application through **HTTP & HTTPS**, you can enable **HTTP/3 support**. Based on the QUIC protocol standard, HTTP/3 provides faster load times and lower latency when compared to previous versions.

When you enable HTTP/3 support, your edge applications can utilize this protocol version in compatible browsers only through *HTTP port 80* and *HTTPS port 443*.

Upon a user's first request to an edge application with HTTP/3, the handshake and first response will be conducted using TCP and HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2. The response from this exchange will assign a value to the [Alt-Svc header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Alt-Svc) that indicates that the latest version of the protocol is available to the browser. If the browser supports HTTP/3, the QUIC protocol and HTTP/3 will be used, unless the cached response misses or expires.


### Ports

Azion offers a simultaneous multiport solution, which means you can customize through which HTTP and HTTPS ports your application will be delivered through. You must choose *at least one port* for each protocol, but you can select from all available ports for delivery.

:::note
If you enable [HTTP/3 support](#http3-support), multiport configuration will be overwritten to the default ports 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS. Simultaneous multiport isn't available for applications with HTTP/3 support.

#### Available ports

| HTTP Port    | HTTPS Port    |
|--------------|---------------|
| 80 (default) | 443 (default) |
| 8008         | 8443          |
| 8080         | 9440          |
| 8880         | 9441          |
|              | 9442          | 
|              | 9443          |
|              | 7777          |
|              | 8888          |
|              | 9553          |
|              | 9653          |
|              | 8035          |
|              | 8090          |



### Minimum TLS version

The **Transport Layer Security (TLS)** protocol allows you to encrypt web traffic. The following TLS versions can be used with edge applications:

- TLS 1.0 (*deprecated*)
- TLS 1.1 (*deprecated*)
- TLS 1.2
- TLS 1.3

You can choose the minimum version of TLS that'll be supported by your edge application. By choosing recent versions of the protocol, older devices or browsers might not be able to access the edge application.

Azion blocks TLS Renegotiation and TLS Resumption by default. If you want to customize this setup, [contact the Sales team](https://www.azion.com/en/contact-sales/).


### TLS Ciphers

Ciphers are cryptography algorithms utilized to encrypt *plaintext* into *ciphertext*, which requires a key to be decrypted. Azion gives you the possibility to change the *cipher suite* your edge application will use in order to protect your application against TLS attacks.

The cipher suite will determine which cryptographic algorithms will be used in the TLS connections of your edge application. Both client and server will *negotiate* the cipher suite to securely encrypt and decrypt the data exchanged during the session.

The table below shows the ciphers available in each cipher suite.

| Cipher                          | TLSv1.2_2018 | TLSv1.2_2019 | TLSv1.2_2021 | TLSv1.3_2022 |

## Mutual Authentication Settings

Enable Mutual Authentication (mTLS) to require that both client and server present an authentication protocol to each other.

Azion Workloads also have **Support for Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS)**, an authentication method for users and visitors that validates the digital certificate on both sides of a request, client, and edge (server). Adding support for mTLS to your **Edge Application** ensures a more secure *TLS/TLS handshake* and is an *Open Banking* requirement.

:::tip
You may need mTLS if your edge application deals with financial services and payments.
:::

To enable this feature, contact our [Sales Team](https://www.azion.com/en/contact-sales/).

---

## Digital Certificate

To use your domain in HTTPS, you'll need a TLS certificate (X.509). Without additional costs, you may include your TLS certificates in [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com) or generate a *Let's Encrypt*™ certificate, which will be automatically managed by Azion.
