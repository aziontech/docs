**Workloads** is an [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com) tool that centralizes communication protocol settingss, such as certificates, domains, ports and protocols.


When you [build an edge application](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/build-an-application/), your application is given an automatically generated **Azion domain**, in the format `xxxx.map.azionedge.net`. You can create multiple Workloads for your edge applications.

If you already own a domain, you can [redirect your traffic to Azion](/en/documentation/products/guides/point-domain-to-azion/) by configuring the records in your DNS provider and listing your **custom domains**.

You may also bind a **Digital Certificate** to domains that use the HTTPS protocol.

## Environment

Before going operational, you can activate a testing configuration to preview setups. When creating a new Domain, you can choose the environment type:

- **Global Edge Network*: production environment of the application. The Azion domain will be in the format `xxxx.map.azionedge.net`.
- **Staging Network**: environment for testing the application. This configuration won't impact the **Production** environment. The Azion domain will be in the format `xxxx.preview.azionedge.net`.

To enable environment selection, contact the [Sales Team](https://www.azion.com/en/contact-sales/).

---
## Infrastructure

Select the infrastructure type for your workload. Once this option is saved, it cannot be modified.



---
## Domains

Manage the domains linked to your application. Ensure proper DNS configuration by mapping CNAME records to the workload domain. You can also use Edge DNS to simplify domain management and seamlessly link your domains to Azion.

## Deployment Settings

Configure the deployment of your workload by selecting the appropriate Edge Application and Edge Firewall. The Edge Application handles traffic routing and processing at the edge, while the Edge Firewall provides security by filtering and blocking malicious traffic.

---
## Protocol Settings

Configure the communication protocols used between the workload and its users. This section allows you to define security, compatibility, and performance settings to optimize how your workload operates at the edge.


- **HTTP**: delivers your application using only the HTTP protocol.
- **HTTP & HTTPS**: delivers your application using both the HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

:::note
If you choose to deliver your application through HTTP & HTTPS, you must associate a [digital certificate](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-firewall/digital-certificates/) to your domain.
:::

#### HTTP/3 support

If you choose to deliver your application through **HTTP & HTTPS**, you can enable **HTTP/3 support**. Based on the QUIC protocol standard, HTTP/3 provides faster load times and lower latency when compared to previous versions.

When you enable HTTP/3 support, your edge applications can utilize this protocol version in compatible browsers only through *HTTP port 80* and *HTTPS port 443*.

Upon a user's first request to an edge application with HTTP/3, the handshake and first response will be conducted using TCP and HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2. The response from this exchange will assign a value to the [Alt-Svc header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Alt-Svc) that indicates that the latest version of the protocol is available to the browser. If the browser supports HTTP/3, the QUIC protocol and HTTP/3 will be used, unless the cached response misses or expires.


### Ports

Azion offers a simultaneous multiport solution, which means you can customize through which HTTP and HTTPS ports your application will be delivered to. You must choose *at least one port* for each protocol, but you can select from all available ports for delivery.

:::note
If you enable [HTTP/3 support](#http3-support), multiport configuration will be overwritten to the default ports 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS. Simultaneous multiport isn't available for applications with HTTP/3 support.
:::

#### Available ports

| HTTP Port    | HTTPS Port    |
|--------------|---------------|
| 80 (default)  | 443 (default)  |
| 8008         | 8443          |
| 8080         | 9440          |
| 8880         | 9441          |
|              | 9442          |
|              | 9443          |
|              | 7777          |
|              | 8888          |
|              | 9553          |
|              | 9653          |
|              | 8035          |
|              | 8090          |



### Minimum TLS version

The **Transport Layer Security (TLS)** protocol allows you to encrypt web traffic. The following TLS versions can be used with edge applications:

- TLS 1.0 (*deprecated*)
- TLS 1.1 (*deprecated*)
- TLS 1.2
- TLS 1.3

You can choose the minimum version of TLS that'll be supported by your edge application. By choosing recent versions of the protocol, older devices or browsers might not be able to access the edge application.

Azion blocks TLS Renegotiation and TLS Resumption by default. If you want to customize this setup, [contact the Sales team](https://www.azion.com/en/contact-sales/).



### TLS Ciphers

Ciphers are cryptography algorithms utilized to encrypt *plaintext* into *ciphertext*, which requires a key to be decrypted. Azion gives you the possibility to change the *cipher suite* your edge application will use in order to protect your application against TLS attacks.

The cipher suite will determine which cryptographic algorithms will be used in the TLS connections of your edge application. Both client and server will *negotiate* the cipher suite to securely encrypt and decrypt the data exchanged during the session.

The table below shows the ciphers available in each cipher suite.

| Cipher | TLSv1.2_2018 | TLSv1.2_2019 | TLSv1.2_2021 | TLSv1.3_2022 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 | ✔︎ | ✔︎ | ✔︎ | ✕ |
| TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 | ✔︎ | ✔︎ | ✔︎ | ✕ |
| TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 | ✔︎ | ✔︎ | ✔︎ | ✕ |

## Mutual Authentication Settings

Enable Mutual Authentication (mTLS) to require that both client and server present an authentication protocol to each other.


Azion's Domains also have **Support for Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS)**, an authentication method for users and visitors that validates the digital certificate on both sides of a request, client, and edge (server). Adding support for mTLS to your **Edge Application** ensures a more secure *TLS/TLS handshake* and is an *Open Banking* requirement.

:::tip
You may need mTLS if your edge application deals with financial services and payments.
:::

To enable this feature, contact our [Sales Team](https://www.azion.com/en/contact-sales/).

---
## CNAME

CNAME is the standard service responsible for creating CNAME settings, enabling you to customize the edge application's domain.

You may restrict access to your application from the Azion domain by enabling the **CNAME Access Only** switch.

The **default limit** is *50* CNAMEs per domain. However, you can increase the limits based on your plan, contacting the [technical support team](/en/documentation/services/support/). To know more about Domains limits, check the [section](#limits) below.

---

## Digital Certificate

To use your domain in HTTPS, you'll need a TLS certificate (X.509). Without additional costs, you may include your TLS certificates in [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com) or generate a *Let's Encrypt*™ certificate, which will be automatically managed by Azion.

---



## Local staging of custom domain

The local `etc/hosts` file maps IP addresses to domains. When you [associate the edge node IP with the CNAME](/en/documentation/products/guides/stage-edge-application-through-hosts-file/) assigned to your domain in your `hosts` file, you force your computer's DNS resolution to access this domain through the edge node and not through public DNS servers. This way, you can stage your application locally as if it were already deployed on your custom domain on the edge before you [point your domain](/en/documentation/products/guides/point-domain-to-azion/) to Azion.
