## Migration overview

Azion is rolling out API v4 in the coming months to improve platform performance, flexibility, and resource management. This update is more than an API change, it introduces new core concepts, such as **Workloads** and **Edge Connector**, and brings significant enhancements to both the API and Azion Console.

API v4 features a new asynchronous, event-driven architecture designed for higher performance and resilience. The new Workload resource model centralizes configuration, making it easier to manage, reuse, and scale your applications. Edge Connector enables more flexible and secure backend integrations.

Azion API v4 is now available in `Preview` for new developer plan accounts and will be released in waves for `General Availability (GA)` according to your service plan.

**Key points about the migration**:

- The migration affects both the platform (with the introduction of **Workloads** and **Edge Connector**) and the API endpoints.
- Some configuration settings have moved to new locations to improve reusability and clarity.
- New personal accounts created from **August 1, 2025**, will use API v4 by default. Existing accounts will be migrated in waves.
- Azion will contact customers with a Technical Account Manager contract to coordinate the migration. Developer-tier accounts will migrate automatically.
- During the transition, you may see documentation with banners allowing you to switch between v3 and v4 versions of a page.
- After your account is migrated you will not be able to use the the v3 API endpoints or create new `Domains`, `Origins` or `Error Responses`. You must use the equivalent new resources. 

API v4 represents a technological shift, providing a foundation for future features and improved operational efficiency across the Azion Web Platform.

## API migration

All API endpoints will be migrated to v4 in waves. To view the available endpoints and parameters, see the [API v4 reference](api.azion.com/v4)

API v3 is now **deprecated** and will no longer receive updates. It will be discontinued on **March 1, 2026**. After this date, all operations must be performed exclusively using API v4.

### Required action

Automations, scripts, and CI/CD pipelines connected to Azion must be updated to use API v4 by the specified deadline.

### New Features

- JWT authentication.
- Activity History via GraphQL for full auditability.
- New event-driven architecture.

### Migration Benefits

- Improved performance
- Increased flexibility

---

## Changes in Edge Applications

The functionality of Edge Applications remains unchanged. However, some configuration options that were previously managed within **Edge Applications** have been moved to other components as part of the migration.

| Setting                                      | New Location      |
|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Delivery Settings                                         | Workloads                  |
| Origin Settings                                      | Edge Connector                  |
| Error Responses                                      | Custom Pages                    |
| Load Balancer                                        | Edge Connector                  |

## Workloads

Azion has adopted the Workload concept to centralize application logic, separating business rules from infrastructure. This enables versioning, reuse, and consistent policy application across environments, following a model inspired by Kubernetes.

**Workloads** replace **Azion Domains**. All settings previously managed in **Azion Domains** are now organized under **Workloads**.

### Operational Changes and User-Facing Impact

The following settings have moved from **Azion Domains** to **Workloads**.

| Setting                        | Previous Location      | New Location in v4         |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Environment Type                | Domains               | Workload (top-level)                   |
| Domain Settings                 | Domains               | Workload > Domain Settings             |
| Edge Application                | Domains > Settings    | Workload > Deployment Settings         |
| Edge Firewall                   | Domains > Settings    | Workload > Deployment Settings         |
| CNAME (text input box)          | Domains > Settings    | Workload > Domain Settings             |
| Digital Certificate             | Domains > Settings    | Workload > Protocol Settings           |
| CNAME Access Only               | Domains > Settings    | Workload > Domain Settings             |
| mTLS (Mutual TLS) Settings      | Domains               | Workload > Mutual Authentication Settings|

**Delivery Settings** previously configured within an Edge Application can now be found in **Workloads** under **Protocol Settings**:

- Protocol Settings
- Delivery Ports
- Minimum TLS version
- TLS Ciphers

#### Notable Behavioral Changes

- **CNAME Access Only**
  - *Previous behavior*: When enabled, the application could only be accessed via CNAME (for example, `app.example.com`).
  - *New behavior*: Replaced by “Allow access via Workload Domain,” enabling access through the auto-generated workload URL (for example, `xxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`).

#### API Usage

Each Workload is implicitly associated with a Deployment. The Deployment defines the relationship between the Workload and the Edge Application (mandatory), as well as optional components such as Edge Firewall and Custom Pages.

When creating a **Workload** via the API, you must also create a Workload Deployment to bind the Workload to an Edge Application. This association ensures that the **Workload** is correctly linked to the intended Edge Application. 

When using the Console, this association is created automatically when you select `Deployment Settings`.

##### Example requests

**Creating a Workload**:

<Code lang="bash" code={`curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.azion.com/v4/workspace/workloads \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "name": "Example Workload",
  "active": true,
  "infrastructure": 1,
  "protocols": {
    "http": {
      "versions": [
        "http1",
        "http2"
      ]
    }
  },
  "workload_domain_allow_access": true
}'
`} />


**Creating a Workload Deployment**:

<Code lang="bash" code={`curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.azion.com/v4/workspace/workloads/<workload_id>/deployments \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "name": "Workload Deployment Example",
  "current": true,
  "active": true,
  "strategy": {
    "type": "default",
    "attributes": {
      "edge_application": <edge_application_id>
    }
  }
}'
`} />

### What happens to my existing Domains?

Domains will be automatically converted to Workloads in phases, ensuring compatibility with the original configurations. The migration will occur in waves. For more information about migration dates, see the details provided below.

After your account is migrated you'll not be able to create new Domains.

### Required action

If you have an automation that currently uses the **Domains** API endpoints you must update it to use v4 **Workloads** endpoints.

### New Features

- **Custom Pages**: Replaces and expands on the previous Error Responses feature. More details are provided [below](#custom-pages).
- **Azion Custom Domain**: You to set up a custom azion domain for your application using the format `example.azion.app`.

### Migration Benefits

- **Improved Organization**: Logically group all resources related to an application or service into a single unit (Workload), making management, visualization, and navigation more efficient. This structure creates clear relationships between components.
- **Scalability and Flexibility**: Simplifies deployment, updates, and scaling of complex applications by allowing all required components to be managed as part of a Workload.
- **Simplified Management**: Centralizes configuration and control of different application elements, reducing operational complexity.
- **Foundation for New Capabilities**: Required for future features such as configuration versioning and more intuitive service connections, for example, linking a domain directly to Edge Storage without relying on an Edge Application.

## Edge Connector

**Edge Connector** centralizes connection settings, allowing you to reuse them across multiple applications, and provides granular control over performance, security, and routing through a unified interface for connecting **Edge Applications** to an origin (your data source), natively incorporating features such as load balancing, HMAC authentication, and Origin Shield.

**Edge Connector*** replaces Edge Application's **Origin** settings. All settings previously managed in Edge Applications **Origins** tab are now organized under **Edge Connector***.

### Operational Changes and User-Facing Impact

All settings previously managed in Edge Applications **Origins** tab are now organized under **Edge Connector***.

| Setting                        | Previous Location      | New Location in v4         |
|-------------------------|------------------------------- |----------------------------------------------------|
| Type                    | Edge Application > Origins > Host Settings                  | Connector Type                                     |
| Protocol Policy         | Edge Application > Origins > Host Settings                  | Connector Options > Transport Protocol Policy       |
| Host Header             | Edge Application > Origins > Host Settings                  | Connector Options > Host                           |
| Address                 | Edge Application > Origins > Host Settings                  | Connector Options > Address Management > Address    |
| Path                    | Edge Application > Origins > Host Settings                  | Connector Options > Path                           |
| HMAC Authentication     | Edge Application > Origins > Host Settings                  | HMAC                                      |
| Connection Timeout      | Edge Application > Origins > Host Settings > Timeouts       | Load Balancer Configuration > Connection Timeout    |
| Between Bytes Timeout   | Edge Application > Origins > Host Settings > Timeouts       | Load Balancer Configuration > Read/Write Timeout    |

#### Notable Behavioral Changes

- **Connector Type**
  - *Previous behavior*: Options included `Single Origin` and `Load Balancer`. This defined whether you could configure one or multiple origins.
  - *New behavior*: `Single Origin` and `Load Balancer` types have been unified into the `HTTP` type. When using multiple origins, you must enable the **Load Balancer Module** to add more origins. 

- **HMAC Authentication**
  - *Previous behavior*: Availiable when configuring an Origin.
  - *New behavior*: Now you must enable the **Origin Shield Module** when configuring an `HTTP` type **Edge Connector**.  

- **Timeouts**
  - *Previous behavior*: `Connection Timeout` and `Between Bytes Timeout` had fixed values.
  - *New behavior*: Now you can configure `Connection Timeout` and `Read/Write Timeout` values in the Load Balancer Configuration section of the Edge Connector.

#### API Usage

You can manage **Edge Connectors** and their configuration through the API using the available v4 endpoints. Refer to the [API reference](https://api.azion.com/v4#/operations/GetEdgeConnectorConnectors) for details on supported operations and parameters.

##### Example requests

## Custom Pages

**Custom Pages** is an Azion feature that allows you to customize error pages for users based on the status code received from an [Edge Connector](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-connector/) when fetching the content from your origin.

**Custom Pages*** replaces Edge Application's **Error Responses** settings. All settings previously managed in Edge Applications' **Error Responses** tab are now organized under **Custom Pages**.

### Operational Changes and User-Facing Impact

All settings previously managed in Edge Aplications **Error Responses** tab are now organized under **Custom Pages**.


| Setting                | Previous Location                                 | New Location in v4                                      |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Default Error Response      | Edge Application > Error Responses                | Custom Pages > Page Codes              |
| Custom Error Response       | Edge Application > Error Responses                | Custom Pages                                            |

| Set Origin                  | Edge Application > Error Responses > Set Origin   | Custom Pages > Response Details > Page Path (URI)       |

#### Notable Behavioral Changes

- **Relationship**
  - *Previous behavior*: Error pages were a part of an **Edge Application**.
  - *New behavior*: Custom Pages are separate resources and are linked to a **Workload**.

- **Edge Connector per Page Code**
  - *Previous behavior*: All error responses had to have the same **Origin**.
  - *New behavior*: You can now assign a specific **Edge Connector** to each error response page code in Custom Pages. This allows you to customize the response for each error code individually.

#### API Usage

You can manage **Custom Pages** and their configuration through the API using the available v4 endpoints. Refer to the [API reference](api.azion.com/v4#/operations/GetWorkspaceCustomPages) for details on supported operations and parameters.

To use a **Custom Page**, you must link it to a **Workload** using the **Workload deployment** endpoint. When using the Console, this association is created under a Workload's deployment setting.

##### Example requests

**Creating a Custom Page**:

<Code lang="bash" code={`curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.azion.com/v4/workspace/custom_pages \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "name": "401 error page",
  "active": true,
  "pages": [
    {
      "code": "401",
      "page": {
        "type": "page_connector",
        "attributes": {
          "connector": <edge_connector_id>,
          "ttl": 300,

---

## Planned migration timeline

The migration process will occur over the next six months.

---

## Recommendations

Here are recommended actions to ensure a smooth migration:

- **Monitor Azion communications**: Stay informed about migration dates, guides, and any tools provided for the transition.
- **Plan your migration**: Assess how your current settings will fit into the new structure and strategically plan the migration of your resources.
- **Prepare your team**: Ensure your team understands the Workloads concept and its impact on application development and deployment on the Azion Web Platform.
- **Test new features**: As the new features are implemented, test the new capabilities to optimize your applications and services.

---
## Q&A

### How can I test the new features?

Starting **August 1, 2025**, new Developer accounts will have access to the updated features. To evaluate these features, you can create a personal account that is not associated with your organization's account. This allows you to test the new functionality independently.

### Do I have to do something?

Most users will not need to take any action, as the migration process is automatic and preserves existing configurations. However, if you use custom automation, scripts, or CI/CD pipelines that interact with the previous API endpoints, you must update them to use the new v4 endpoints. Review your integrations to ensure compatibility after migration.

## What should I do if I need assistance?

You can contact our [support team](/en/documentation/services/support) ) or ask [Azion Copilot](https://console.azion.com/copilot).
