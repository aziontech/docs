You can use two methods to create your Azion account: *email* and *Social Login*. The next sections will provide more information on the sign-up process.

## Creating an account using Social Login

Azion also allows you to create your account through Social Login. Currently, the platform supports **GitHub** and **Google** accounts.

To create an account using a Social Login, proceed as follows:

1. From the [sign-up page](https://console.azion.com/signup), click the *Social Login* option of your choice:

- **Continue with GitHub**
- **Continue with Google**

2. If requested, enter your username and password according to the chosen *Social Login* option.

   - In some cases, you'll need to complete a few more steps, such as proceeding with authorization options.

3. Complete the form to personalize your experience, according to your preferences.
4. Click the **Submit** button.

By choosing to create your account via Social Login, there's no need to verify your email.
