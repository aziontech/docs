To begin using Azion Edge Platform and all the available products, you need to complete the sign-up process and log in to the configuration interface, [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).

You can use two methods to create your Azion account: *email* and *Social Login*. The next sections will provide more information on the sign-up process.
