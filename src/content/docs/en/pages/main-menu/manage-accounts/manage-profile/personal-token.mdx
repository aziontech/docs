[Personal Tokens](/en/documentation/products/accounts/personal-tokens/) allow you to authenticate your access to interfaces and tools such as the [Azion CLI](/en/documentation/products/build/develop-with-azion/cli/) and [Azion API](/en/documentation/products/overview-azion-api/).

## Creating a personal token

### Via RTM

1. Log in to [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. In the **Account Menu** on the top-right corner, represented by three horizontal lines, and select **Personal Tokens**.
3. Click the **Add a personal token** button.
4. Fill in the required fields:

   - **Personal Token name**
   - **Expires in**. You can choose the token expiration date between 1, 7, 15, 30, 90 days, 1 year, or a custom date.
   - **Personal Token description** (optional)

5. Click the **Create Token** button.
6. Click the **visibility** icon in the **Personal Token** field to see your token.
7. Click the **copy token** icon to copy your token.

:::note
You can only see your token when you first create it.

### Via API

1. Run the following cURL command in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with an already existing personal token:

```
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/iam/personal_tokens' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{   
    "name": "One day token",
    "expires_at": "2023-07-26T00:00",
    "description": "example"
}'
```

You can also change the `name`, `expires_at`, and `description` fields.

:::tip
Check the [Azion API documentation](https://api.azion.com/) and the [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/aziontech/azionapi-openapi/) to know more about all features available via API.
