```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/iam/personal_tokens' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{   
    "name": "One day token",
    "expires_at": "2023-07-26T00:00",
    "description": "example"
}'
```

You can also change the `name`, `expires_at`, and `description` fields.
