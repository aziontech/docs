Azion has two user interfaces: Real-Time Manager and Console, which is in *Preview* stage. Currently, Console is only available for Developer plans and new accounts. Follow the steps according to the user interface you're using.

To generate credentials to use and authenticate services, follow these steps:

<Tabs client:visible>
    <Fragment slot="tab.console">Console</Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.rtm">Real-Time Manager</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.console">
1. Access [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com/).
2. Access the **Credentials** page on the **Account menu** on the top-right corner, represented by the avatar.
3. Click the **+ Credential** button.
4. Choose a name for your credential.
5. Describe how or by whom the credential will be used in the **Description** field in **Settings**.
    - Example: `Credential used for Edge Nodes registration`.
6. Click the **Save** button.
</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.rtm">
1. Access [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. Access the **Credentials** page on the **Account menu** on the top-right corner, represented by the avatar.
3. Click the **Add Credential** button.
4. Choose a name for your credential.
5. Describe how or by whom the credential will be used in the **Description** field in **Settings**.

</Fragment>

</Tabs>

A token will be generated after the credential is saved.

When clicking on the created credential on the **Credentials** page, you can:

- Copy the generated token.
- Delete your credential.
- Edit your credential. You can update your credential's *name*, *description*, and *status* (active/inactive).
