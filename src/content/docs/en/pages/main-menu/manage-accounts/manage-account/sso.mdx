If you have an [Enterprise plan](https://www.azion.com/en/professional-services/) and have SSO configured for your company, your users can log in to Azion using their SSO credentials.

To access **SSO Management**:

1. Log in to [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com).
2. On the upper-right corner of the page, select the avatar menu. This is the **Account menu**.
3. Select **SSO Management**.

:::note
Only users with *Account Owner* status can configure team member login settings using one of two account authentication options: **Azion SSO** or an external **Identity Provider (IdP)**.

## Adding an IdP

After accessing the page, click the **Add Identity Provider** button and choose the protocol you want to register.

You can choose to configure a SAML Identity Provider or an OIDC Identity Provider.
