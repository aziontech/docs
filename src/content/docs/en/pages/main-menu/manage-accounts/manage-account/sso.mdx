:::caution[important]
Azion has two user interfaces: Real-Time Manager and Console, which is in *Preview* stage. Currently, Console is only available for Developer plans and new accounts. Follow the steps according to the user interface you're using.
:::

If you have an [Enterprise plan](https://www.azion.com/en/professional-services/) and have SSO configured for your company, your users can log in to Azion using their SSO credentials.

To access **SSO Management**:

<Tabs client:visible>
    <Fragment slot="tab.console">Console</Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.rtm">Real-Time Manager</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.console">
1. Log in to [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com).
2. On the upper-right corner of the page, select the avatar menu. This is the **Account menu**.
3. Select **SSO Management**.
</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.rtm">

## Adding an IdP

After accessing the page, click the **Add Identity Provider** button and choose the protocol you want to register.

You can choose to configure a SAML Identity Provider or an OIDC Identity Provider.
