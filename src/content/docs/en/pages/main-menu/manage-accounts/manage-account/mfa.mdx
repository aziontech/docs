### Enable MFA for an specific user linked to the account

2. Click the **Account Menu** on the top-right corner, represented by the avatar, and select **Users Management**.
3. Select the desired user to access their profile.
4. In the Security Settings section enable the **Multi-Factor Authentication** switch.

2. Click the **Account Menu** on the top right-right corner, represented by the avatar, and select **Account Settings**.

## Setting up an MFA mobile application 

To install an authenticator application on your mobile phone, consult your operational system's app store (such as iOS' App Store or Android's Google Play). You can use Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator applications, for instance.

Once you've downloaded the application and logged in, follow these steps to connect the Azion's account to your chosen authenticator application:

1. Locate and click the **+** button.
2. Select the account type you're going to add. The camera will start.
3. Scan the QR code that appears when you log into Azion's platform.
4. Type the six-digit code and click **Verify Code**.

With MFA, you must have access to your mobile phone to log into Azion and provide the 6-digit code.

## Logging in to Azion using MFA

To log in to Azion's platform with Multi-Factor Authentication activated:

1. On Console's login page, insert your login credentials (email and password) and click **Sign In**.
2. Start your authenticator application.
3. Type the six-digit code in the specified space on Console and click **Verify**.

## Disabling MFA for an user linked to an account

In case of loss or theft of your mobile phone, you won't be able to log in to Azion unless an **Account owner** resets the MFA function.

:::note
MFA can be reset only if the MFA enforcement isn't mandatory for the account's users.
:::

To do so, you can ask for an **Account owner** user to deactivate your MFA function. In case you're an **Account owner**:

1. Access [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com).
2. Click the **Account Menu** on the top-right corner, represented by the avatar, and select **Users Management**.
3. Select the desired user to access their profile.
4. Disable the MFA switch.
5. Click **Save** to finish the process.

If you're the only **Account owner** within the account, it's necessary to contact the [support team](https://tickets.azion.com/en/support/loginen/support/login) to reset the MFA.
