With [Teams Permissions](/en/documentation/products/accounts/teams-permissions/), you can create and manage teams, as well as control and configure access rights for distinct teams within your organization.

:::note
You must be the **Account Owner** or have the **Edit Users** permission to perform these settings.
:::

To access Teams Permissions:

1. Log in to [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. On the upper-right corner of the page, select the avatar menu. This is the **Account menu**.
3. Click in **Teams Permissions**.

---

## Adding teams

You can create teams before or after adding users.

To add a new team:

1. On the **Teams Permission** screen, click **Add team**.
2. Type a name for the new team in the field **Name for Team**.
3. In the **Permissions** section, you'll see the **Available Permissions* and **Chosen Permissions** selection boxes.
4. Click in the permission you want to grant to the team in **Available Permissions** and then on the **arrow** to move it to **Chosen Permissions**.

By selecting permissions, you grant access to the functions set for that permission to users on that team only.

:::note
Permissions are independent from each other. For example, the Edit Users permission doesn't enable a team to view users. In that case, you must activate View Users as well.

## Activating configurations

At the bottom of the screen, you'll find the following options:

- **Active**: enables or disables a user on the system.
- **Cancel**: with this option, you return to the **Teams Permissions** page, and you also discard any edits.
- **Save**: once you finish your settings, click the **Save** button.

When you save your configurations, you'll return to the **Teams Permissions** screen, where you'll see the list of teams, their permissions, and whether they're *Active* or not.

## Modifying team permissions

You can modify the team permissions in **RTM** whenever you like.

1. [Log in to RTM](https://manager.azion.com/) and select **Teams Permissions**
2. On the **Teams Permissions** screen, select the desired team.
3. Change permissions through the selection boxes. 

The selection process is the same as for the selection boxes described in [Adding teams](#adding-teams).

## Deleting teams

Before deleting teams, you must remove all users from the team.

1. [Log in to RTM](https://manager.azion.com/) and select **Teams Permissions**.
2. On the **Teams Permissions** screen, while hovering the cursor over teams, you'll see the **trash can** icon being enabled. Click the trash can to delete a team.
3. When you click the trash can, a message will appear asking you to confirm the deletion. To confirm, type the required word in the text box.
4. Click the **Delete** button to confirm the deletion request. You'll then return to the **Teams Permissions** screen, where a confirmation message is displayed.
