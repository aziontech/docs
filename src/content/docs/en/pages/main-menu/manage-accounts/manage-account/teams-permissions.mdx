import Tabs from '~/components/tabs/Tabs'

:::caution[important]
Azion has two user interfaces: Real-Time Manager and Console, which is in *Preview* stage. Currently, Console is only available for Developer plans and new accounts. Follow the steps according to the user interface you're using.
:::

With [Teams Permissions](/en/documentation/products/accounts/teams-permissions/), you can create and manage teams, as well as control and configure access rights for distinct teams within your organization.

To access **Teams Permissions**:

<Tabs client:visible>
    <Fragment slot="tab.console">Console</Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.rtm">Real-Time Manager</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.console">
1. Log in to [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com).
2. On the upper-right corner of the page, select the avatar menu. This is the **Account menu**.
3. Click in **Teams Permissions**.
</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.rtm">
1. Log in to [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. On the upper-right corner of the page, select the avatar menu. This is the **Account menu**.
3. Click in **Teams Permissions**.
</Fragment>

</Tabs>

:::note
You must be the **Account Owner** or have the **Edit Users** permission to perform these settings.

## Adding teams

You can create teams before or after adding users.

To add a new team:

<Tabs client:visible>
    <Fragment slot="tab.console">Console</Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.rtm">Real-Time Manager</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.console">
1. On the **Teams Permission** screen, click **+ Team**.
2. Type a name for the new team in the field **Name**.
3. In the **Permissions** section, you'll see the **Available Permissions** and **Chosen Permissions** selection boxes.
4. Click in the permission you want to grant to the team in **Available Permissions** and then on the **arrow** to move it to **Chosen Permissions**.

By selecting permissions, you grant access to the functions set for that permission to users on that team only.

:::note
Permissions are independent from each other. For example, the **Edit Users** permission doesn't enable a team to view users. In that case, you must activate **View Users** as well.
