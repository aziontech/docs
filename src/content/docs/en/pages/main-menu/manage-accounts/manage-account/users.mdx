## Adding users to an account

You can add users before or after [creating teams](/en/documentation/products/accounts/teams-permissions/).

To add a new user:

<Tabs client:visible>
    <Fragment slot="tab.console">Console</Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.rtm">Real-Time Manager</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.console">
1. On the **Users Management** screen, click **+ User**. You'll see three sections with their respective fields:
   - **Profile**: **First name**, **Last name**, **Timezone**, and **Language**.
   - **Contact Information**: **Email** and **Phone Number**.
   - **Security Settings**: **Teams**, **Social login**, and **Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication**.
2. Fill in the fields as prompted. Fields marked with an asterisk are required.
   - If you haven't yet created a team when adding a user, you can choose the **Default Team**.
3. Click the **Save** button.

When you save your configurations, you return to the **Users Management** screen, where you'll see the list of users sorted by contact details, the team they belong to, MFA status, and whether they are *Active* or not.
