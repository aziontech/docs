[Users Management](/en/documentation/products/accounts/users-and-teams/) allows you to add, modify, and delete users to your account.

To access Users Management:

1. Log in to [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. On the upper-right corner of the page, select the avatar menu. This is the **Account menu**.
3. Click in **Users Management**.

## Adding users to an account

You can add users before or after [creating teams](/en/documentation/products/accounts/teams-permissions/).

To add a new user:

1. On the Users Management screen, click **Add user**. You'll see three sections with their respective fields:

- **User profile**: **First name**, **Last name**, **Timezone**, and **Language**.
- **Contact information**: **Email** and **Mobile**.
- **Security settings**: **Account owner**, **Teams**, and **Multi-Factor Authentication**.

2. Fill in the fields as prompted. Fields marked with an asterisk are required.

If you haven't yet created a team when adding a user, you can choose the **Default Team** [in RTM](https://manager.azion.com/).

### Select boxes: Available Teams and Chosen Teams

1. To select the teams where the user'll be allocated, click the desired team in **Available Teams** and then on the **arrow** to move your selection to the **Chosen Teams** box.

In order to speed up the process, you can select more than one team at the same time:

   - You can select all teams at once using the *Choose all* option, located below the **Available Teams** box.
   - You can also select in sequence by holding down the *Shift* key while clicking on the desired options.
   - Or alternatively select by holding down the *Shift*, *Ctrl*, or *Cmd* keys while clicking on the desired teams.

2. You can also undo your selection at any time. Click the desired team in **Chosen Teams** and then the **arrow** to move your selection back to the **Available Teams** box.

You can still deselect all teams at once by using the **Clear selection** option, located below the **Chosen Teams** box, and use the *Shift*, *Ctrl*, or *Cmd* keys, as described above.

## Activating your configurations

- **Active**: enables or disables a user on the system.
- **Cancel**: with this option, you return to the **Users Management** page, and you also discard any edits.
- **Save**: once you finish your settings, click the **Save** button.

When you save your configurations, you return to the **Users Management** screen, where you'll see the list of users sorted by contact details, the team they belong to, MFA status, and whether they are *Active* or not.

:::note
New users will receive an automatic email to activate the account, which will be available for 14 days. If it isn't activated within that period, they will be automatically removed from RTM.
