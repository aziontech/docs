[Users Management](/en/documentation/products/accounts/users-management/) allows you to add, modify, and delete users to your account.

To access **Users Management**:

1. Log in to [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com).
2. On the upper-right corner of the page, select the avatar menu. This is the **Account menu**.
3. Click in **Users Management**.

## Adding users to an account

You can add users before or after [creating teams](/en/documentation/products/accounts/teams-permissions/).

To add a new user:

1. On the **Users Management** screen, click **+ User**. You'll see three sections with their respective fields:
   - **Profile**: **First name**, **Last name**, **Timezone**, and **Language**.
   - **Contact Information**: **Email** and **Phone Number**.
   - **Security Settings**: **Teams**, **Social login**, and **Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication**.
2. Fill in the fields as prompted. Fields marked with an asterisk are required.
   - If you haven't yet created a team when adding a user, you can choose the **Default Team**.
3. Click the **Save** button.

When you save your configurations, you return to the **Users Management** screen, where you'll see the list of users sorted by contact details, the team they belong to, MFA status, and whether they are *Active* or not.

:::note
New users will receive an automatic email to activate the account, which will be available for *14 days*. If it isn't activated within that period, they'll be automatically removed from Azion's platform.
