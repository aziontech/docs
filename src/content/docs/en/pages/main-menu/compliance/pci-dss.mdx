## What's PCI

**PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)** is a certification issued by the **PCI Security Standards Council** that defines the international security requirements necessary for companies in the payment card sector and their service providers to operate reliably, adequately protecting both their technology systems and their customers' data and operations.

Created and governed by major credit card companies worldwide, PCI-DSS is required for any business that handles credit card transactions.

So whether you have an online store or are otherwise adopting PCI standards as best practice, you must undergo a thorough annual process responding to 12 requirements, encompassing 250+ individual controls, that check how the company handles security, privacy, and availability in its systems. Businesses that process a high level of transactions must meet a higher level of PCI compliance, requiring more frequent network scans and external audits.

Although PCI certification is required for e-commerce, all digital businesses can benefit from using a PCI-certified provider. By providing a higher standard of security, PCI compliance reduces the likelihood of data breaches, elevates user trust, and enables industry-specific use cases, such as securing patient data for healthcare companies or enabling online tuition payments for educational groups.
