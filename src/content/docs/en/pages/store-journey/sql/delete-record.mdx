This guide demonstrates how to use Azion **Edge SQL** to delete a record in your database using the Azion API.

## Deleting a record

Run the following `POST` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and `{id_database}` with the ID of the database from which you want to delete the record:

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'https://api.azion.com/v4/edge_sql/databases/{id_database}/query' \
--header 'Authorization: Token <token_value>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
"statements": [
"delete from people where name = '\''name'\'' "
]
}'
```

You should receive a response indicating the success or failure of the operation.
