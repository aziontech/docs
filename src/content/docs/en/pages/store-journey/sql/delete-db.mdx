This guide demonstrates how to use Azion **Edge SQL** to delete a database related to your account using the Azion API.

## Deleting databases

Run the following `DELETE` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and `[DB_ID]` with the ID of the database you want to delete:

```bash
curl --location --request DELETE 'https://api.azion.com/v4/edge_sql/databases/[DB_ID]' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token <token_value>'
``` 

You should receive the following response:


```
{
  "state": "pending",
  "data": null
}
```

:::note 
The deletion of a database is async. You can check its state by retrieving information of the database.
