EdgeSQL Shell is a command-line interface (CLI) tool for interacting with Azion Edge SQL, allowing users to manage databases, execute SQL commands, and perform various database operations.

This guide will show you how to install EdgeSQL Shell and start taking advantage of its features to easily manage your databases.

## Requirements

In order to install EdgeSQL Shell you must have the following dependencies installed:

-  Python 3.x
-  [Psycopg2](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/)
-  [MySQL Connector/Python](https://pypi.org/project/mysql-connector-python/)

You'll also need an Azion [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/).

## Installing EdgeSQL Shell

1. Clone the EdgeSQL Shell git repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/aziontech/edgesql-shell.git
```

2. Enter the directory:

```sh
cd edgesql-shell
```

3. Install the Python dependencies:

```sh
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
brew install postgresql
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Install the required system dependencies:

```sh
pip install mysql-connector-python
pip install psycopg2
```

5. Set your **personal token** as an environment variable:

```sh
 export AZION_TOKEN="<your_auth_token_here>"
```

6. Execute the following command to run the EdgeSQL Shell:
