This guide demonstrates how to use Azion **Edge SQL** to delete an existing database using the Azion API.

## Deleting a database

Run the following `DELETE` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and `{id_database}` with the ID of the database you want to delete:

```bash
curl --location --request DELETE 'https://api.azion.com/v4/edge_sql/databases/{id_database}' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]'
```

You should receive a response similar to this:

```bash
 {"state":"pending","data":null}
```

:::note
This action can't be undone, but there's a propagation time. After deleting a database, you won't be able to retrieve its information.
