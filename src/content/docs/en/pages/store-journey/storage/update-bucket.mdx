This guide walks you through updating an Object Storage bucket using the Azion API and Azion CLI. It includes changing the permissions of a bucket, which can be crucial for managing access to your data. 

## Updating a bucket

<Tabs client:visible>
    <Fragment slot="tab.cli">Azion CLI</Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.api">API</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.cli">

## Requirements 

- [Azion CLI installed](/en/documentation/products/azion-cli/overview/#installing-azion-cli). 
- [A personal token configured](/en/documentation/devtools/cli/globals/#token).

To update a bucket: 

```bash 
azion update edge-storage bucket
```

Azion CLI will present a series of interactions, so the bucket can be updated. Run `azion update edge-storage bucket -h` for further information about the data that can be updated. 

</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.api">

In this example, you will change the permission of the bucket. 
 
Run the following `PATCH` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and `bucket_name` with the name of the bucket to attribute the read-write permission:

```bash
curl --location --request PATCH 'https://api.azion.com/v4/storage/buckets/<bucket_name>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json;' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--data '{
    "edge_access": "read_write"
}'
```

You should receive the following response:

```json
{
  "state": "executed",
  "data": {
    "name": "my-bucket-ro",
    "edge_access": "read_write"
  }
}
```

:::note 
The bucket's name cannot be updated.

:::caution[Warning]
When a bucket is configured with **read-write permissions**, any user can access and modify its content (for example, by sending a PUT request to overwrite files). If the bucket is used as an origin for an applications, this configuration may expose the content to unauthorized modifications. However, suppose the bucket is accessed through an function. In that case, the risk is managed by the logic implemented in the function code, allowing developers to enforce stricter controls over who can access or modify the data. To mitigate risks, always verify the required permissions for each use case and implement proper access controls.
