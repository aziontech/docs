This guide walks you through updating an Edge Storage bucket using the Azion API and Azion CLI. It includes changing the permissions of a bucket, which can be crucial for managing access to your data. 

## Updating a bucket

<Tabs client:visible>
    <Fragment slot="tab.cli">Azion CLI</Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.api">API</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.cli">

## Requirements 

- [Azion CLI installed](/en/documentation/products/azion-cli/overview/#installing-azion-cli). 
- [A personal token configured](/en/documentation/devtools/cli/globals/#token).

To update a bucket: 

```bash 
azion update edge-storage bucket
```

Azion CLI will present a series of interactions, so the bucket can be updated. Run `azion update edge-storage bucket -h` for further information about the data that can be updated.

<Fragment slot="panel.api">

In this example, you will change the permission of the bucket. 
 
Run the following `PATCH` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and `bucket_name` with the name of the bucket to attribute the read-write permission:

```bash
curl --location --request PATCH 'https://api.azion.com/v4/storage/buckets/<bucket_name>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--data '{
    "edge_access": "read_write"
}'
```

You should receive the following response:

```json
{
  "state": "executed",
  "data": {
    "name": "my-bucket-ro",
    "edge_access": "read_write"
  }
}
```

:::note 
The bucket's name cannot be updated.
