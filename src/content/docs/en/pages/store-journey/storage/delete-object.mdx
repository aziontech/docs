This guide walks you through deleting an Edge Storage bucket's object using the [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/), [Azion CLI](/en/documentation/products/azion-cli/overview/), and [Azion Runtime](/en/documentation/runtime/api-reference/storage/).

## Deleting an object from a bucket

    <Fragment slot="tab.api">API</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.cli">
## Requirements 

- [Azion CLI installed](/en/documentation/products/azion-cli/overview/#installing-azion-cli). 
- [A personal token configured](/en/documentation/devtools/cli/globals/#token).

To delete an object: 

```bash 
azion delete edge-storage object --bucket-name bucketname  --object-key objectname
```

</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.api">

To delete an object, run the following `DELETE` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/), `<bucket_name>` with the name of your bucket, `<object_key>` with an ID or name for the object:

```bash
curl --request DELETE \
  --url https://api.azion.com/v4/storage/buckets/<bucketName>/objects/<objectKey> \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

You should receive the following response:

```json
{
  "state": "executed",
  "data": {
    "object_key": "people-100.txt"
  }
}
```

</Fragment>

You can create an edge function to delete an object:

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/) > **Edge Functions**.
2. Click the **+ Edge Function** button.
3. Name your function. Example: `delete_object`.
4. In the **Code** tab, add the following JavaScript code:

```js
import Storage from "azion:storage";

async function handleRequest(event) {
    const bucket = "mybucket";
    const storage = new Storage(bucket);
    const key = "test";
    try{
        await storage.delete(key);
    }catch(error){
        return new Response(error, {status:500});
    }
    return new Response("Ok");
}

addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {
    event.respondWith(handleRequest(event));
});
```


:::note 
Remember to replace "mybucket" with your bucket's name and "test" with the object key.
:::

5. Click the **Save** button.

:::note
See the [Edge Storage API](/en/documentation/runtime/api-reference/storage/) reference for more details on functions available for other types of requests.
:::

Once you have the edge function ready, you need to create an edge application that will proxy the deleting process for the bucket and instantiate the edge function.
