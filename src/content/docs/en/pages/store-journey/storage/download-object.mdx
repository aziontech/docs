This guide walks you through downloading an object from an Edge Storage bucket using the [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/) and [Azion Runtime](/en/documentation/runtime/api-reference/storage/).

## Downloading an object from a bucket

<Tabs client:visible>
    <Fragment slot="tab.runtime">Azion Runtime</Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.api">API</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.api">

To download the object, run the following `GET` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/), `<bucket_name>` with the name of your bucket, and `<object_key>` with the key created for the object:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azion.com/v4/storage/buckets/<bucket_name>/objects/<object_key>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]'
```

You should now see the contents of the object in your terminal.

:::note
To download the object to your device locally, add the cURL options `-O` to use the header-provided object name and `-J` to write the output into a file, as follows:

<Code lang="bash" code={`
curl --location 'https://api.azion.com/v4/storage/buckets/<bucket_name>/objects/<object_key> -O -J' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]'
