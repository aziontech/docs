This guide walks you through downloading an object from an Object Storage bucket using the [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/) and [Azion Runtime](/en/documentation/runtime/api-reference/storage/).

## Downloading an object from a bucket

To download the object, run the following `GET` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/), `<bucket_name>` with the name of your bucket, and `<object_key>` with the key created for the object:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azion.com/v4/storage/buckets/<bucket_name>/objects/<object_key>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json;' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]'
```

You should now see the contents of the object in your terminal.

:::note
To download the object to your device locally, add the cURL options `-O` to use the header-provided object name and `-J` to write the output into a file, as follows:

<Code lang="bash" code={`
curl --location 'https://api.azion.com/v4/storage/buckets/<bucket_name>/objects/<object_key> -O -J' \
--header 'Accept: application/json;' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]'
`} />

When working with files that have a prefix in the object key, like `folder/file.csv`, using these options won't create a new directory. Instead, the file will be downloaded directly to the root folder where the command was initiated.

You can create an function to download objects from your bucket using a `GET` console command. To do so:

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Functions**.
2. Click the **+ Function** button.
3. Name your function. Example: `my-bucket GET`.
4. In the **Code** tab, add the following JavaScript code, passing your bucket's name and the object key:

```js
import Storage from "azion:storage";

async function handleRequest(event) {
    try{
        const bucket = "mybucket";
        const storage = new Storage(bucket);
        const key = "test";
        const storageObject = await storage.get(key);
        return new Response(storageObject.content);
    }catch(error){
        return new Response(error, {status:500});
    }
}

addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {
    event.respondWith(handleRequest(event));
});
```

:::note 
Remember to replace "mybucket" with your bucket's name and "test" with the object key.
:::

5. Click the **Save** button.

:::note
See the [Object Storage API](/en/documentation/runtime/api-reference/storage/) reference for more details on functions available for other types of requests.
:::

Once you have the function ready, you need to create an applications that will proxy the process for the bucket and instantiate the function.
