This guide walks you through downloading an object from an Edge Storage bucket using the [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/) and [Azion Runtime](/en/documentation/runtime/api-reference/storage/).

## Downloading an object from a bucket

To download the object, run the following `GET` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/), `<bucket_name>` with the name of your bucket, and `<object_key>` with the key created for the object:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azion.com/v4/storage/buckets/<bucket_name>/objects/<object_key>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]'
```

You should now see the contents of the object in your terminal.

:::note
To download the object to your device locally, add the cURL options `-O` to use the header-provided object name and `-J` to write the output into a file, as follows:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azion.com/v4/storage/buckets/<bucket_name>/objects/<object_key> -O -J' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]'
```

When working with files that have a prefix in the object key, like `folder/file.csv`, using these options won't create a new directory. Instead, the file will be downloaded directly to the root folder where the command was initiated.

You can create an edge function to download objects from your bucket using a `GET` console command. To do so:

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Edge Functions**.
2. Click the **+ Edge Function** button.
3. Name your function. Example: `my-bucket GET`.
4. In the **Code** tab, add the following JavaScript code, passing your bucket's name and the object key:

```js
import Storage from "azion:storage";

async function handleRequest(event) {
    try{
        const bucket = "mybucket";
        const storage = new Storage(bucket);
        const key = "test";
        const storageObject = await storage.get(key);
        return new Response(storageObject.content);
    }catch(error){
        return new Response(error, {status:500});
    }
}

addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {
    event.respondWith(handleRequest(event));
});
```

:::note 
Remember to replace "mybucket" with your bucket's name and "test" with the object key.

5. Click the **Save** button.

:::note
See the [Edge Storage API](/en/documentation/runtime/api-reference/storage/) reference for more details on functions available for other types of requests.
:::

Once you have the edge function ready, you need to create an edge application that will proxy the process for the bucket and instantiate the edge function.
