This guide walks you through setting a bucket as origin of an applications using the [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/), [Azion CLI](/en/documentation/products/azion-cli/overview/), and [Azion Runtime](/en/documentation/runtime/api-reference/storage/).

<LinkButton link="/en/documentation/products/store/object-storage/" label="go to Object Storage reference" severity="secondary" target="_blank" />

There are separate instructions for API v3 using [legacy Origin](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/domains/) settings and API v4 using the new [Connector](/en/documentation/products/secure/connectors) product.

## Create a bucket and upload files

This section describes how you can upload objects to a bucket and maintain project structure using the [Azion API](https://api.azion.com). In this scenario, you'll create a static application using two files, distributed into folders as follows:

<Code lang="txt" code={`src/index.html
src/styles/style.css
`} />

1. Create the following `index.html` file inside of a local `src` directory:

<Code lang="html" code={`<!-- src/index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>I am an object from a bucket.</p>
</body>
</html>
`} />

2. Now create the `style.css` file, which is referenced in the HTML, under the `styles` folder in the same directory:

<Code lang="css" code={`/* src/styles/style.css */
body {
background-color: black;
}

h1, p {
    color: #F3652B;
}
`} />

3. Run the following `POST` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and writing the desired bucket name in `name` to create a read-only bucket:

<Code lang="bash" code={`curl --location 'https://api.azion.com/v4/storage/buckets' \
--header 'Accept: application/json;' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--data '{
    "name": "app-origin",
    "edge_access": "read_only"
}'
`} />

4. You should receive the following response:

<Code lang="json" code={`{
  "state": "executed",
  "data": {
    "name": "app-origin",
    "edge_access": "read_only"
  }
}
`} />

5. Run the following `POST` requests in your terminal for each file, replacing `<bucket_name>` with the name of the bucket you just created:

    - For the `index.html` file, run the following command using `src/index.html` as the object key, and adding the object path as data:

<Code lang="bash" code={`curl --location 'https://api.azion.com/v4/storage/buckets/<bucket_name>/objects/src/index.html' \
--header 'Accept: application/json;' \
--header 'Content-Type: text/html' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--data '@./src/index.html'
`} />

    - For the `styles.css` file, run the following command using `src/styles/style.css` as the object key, and adding the object path as data:

<Code lang="bash" code={`curl --location 'https://api.azion.com/v4/storage/buckets/<bucket_name>/objects/src/styles/style.css' \
--header 'Accept: application/json;' \
--header 'Content-Type: text/css' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--data '@./src/styles/style.css'
`} />

6. You should receive the following responses for the files:

<Code lang="json" code={`{
    "state": "executed",
    "data": {
        "object_key": "src/index.html"
    }
}
`} />

<Code lang="json" code={`{
    "state": "executed",
    "data": {
        "object_key": "src/styles/style.css"
    }
}
`} />

:::caution[Warning]
When a bucket is configured with **read-write permissions**, any user can access and modify its content (for example, by sending a PUT request to overwrite files). If the bucket is used as an origin for an applications, this configuration may expose the content to unauthorized modifications. However, suppose the bucket is accessed through an function. In that case, the risk is managed by the logic implemented in the function code, allowing developers to enforce stricter controls over who can access or modify the data. To mitigate risks, always verify the required permissions for each use case and implement proper access controls. Read more on [Authentication and permissions](/en/documentation/products/store/object-storage/#authentication-and-permissions).

## Create an applications and set origin type to Object Storage

Now that your bucket is populated with files, you can create a new applications and a domain to set the bucket as the origin of the content and serve these objects.

To facilitate this process, use the [Applications Proxy](/en/documentation/products/guides/edge-application-proxy-template/) template:

1. Access [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com).
    - If you don't have an account yet, create a new one [by visiting the sign-up page](https://console.azion.com/signup).
2. On the homepage, select the **+ Create** option.
3. Find the **Applications Proxy** card in the templates section and select it.
4. Give your application an easy-to-remember name.
5. In **Route to bypass**, type `/` to specify the root path of the application.
6. Wait for the deployment process to finish.
7. Copy the domain of the application, in the format `http://xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/`.

:::note
The link to the applications allows you to see it on the browser. However, it takes a certain time to propagate and configure the application in Azion’s edge locations. It may be necessary to wait a few minutes for the URL to be activated and for the application page to be effectively displayed in the browser.
:::

Now you need to configure a new **Connector** to link your application to your Object Storage bucket. To do so:

1. [Access Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Connectors**.
2. Click the **+ Connector** button.
3. In the **General** section, give your connector a unique and descriptive name (e.g., `My Object Storage Connector`).
4. In the **Connector Type** section, select **Object Storage**.
5. In the **Connection Options** section:
    - For **Bucket**, select the name of the bucket you created in the previous steps.
    - For **Prefix**, enter `/src` (or the prefix you used when uploading your objects).
6. Set the **Status** to **Active**.
7. Click the **Save** button.

To activate the Connector in your applications:

1. Access the **Rules Engine** tab.
2. Edit the default rule or add a new request rule.
3. In the **Criteria** section, to apply the Connector for your whole application, set the **criteria** to `If ${uri} starts with /`.
4. In the **Behavior** section, select the Set Connector behavior.
5. Select the Connector you want to apply.
6. Click the **Save** button.
7. Wait some time for the changes to propagate to the edge.

Once the changes have been made, access `http://xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/index.html` to see the HTML file you uploaded with the applied CSS style.

3. Find the **Applications Proxy** card in the templates section and select it.
4. Give your application an easy-to-remember name.
5. In **Origin Address**, type `httpbin.org`. 
    - This is a temporary origin that will later be replaced with an Object Storage origin.
6. In **Route to bypass**, type `/` to specify the root path of the application.
7. Wait for the deployment process to finish.
8. Copy the domain of the application, in the format `http://xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/`.

It may be necessary to wait a few minutes for the URL to be activated and for the application page to be effectively displayed in the browser.

Now you need to configure a new **Object Storage** origin and determine that your application should retrieve content from the bucket and prefix you created. To do so:

1. [Access Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Applications**.
2. Click the proxy application you created in the previous steps.
3. Navigate to the **Origins** tab.
4. Click the **+ Origin** button.
5. Give your origin an easy-to-remember name.
6. In **Origin Type**, select **Object Storage**.
7. In **Bucket Name**, add the name of the bucket you created in the previous steps.
8. In **Prefix**, add `/src`, which is the prefix you added to the object keys uploaded previously.
9. Click the **Save** button.

To activate the origin in your applications:

10. Navigate to the **Rules Engine** tab.
11. Select the **Default Rule**.
12. Under **Behaviors**, in the **Set Origin** behavior, replace the **Default Origin** with the origin you created for your bucket.
13. Click the **Save** button.
14. Wait some time for the changes to propagate to the edge.

Once the changes have been made, access `http://xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/index.html` to see the HTML file you uploaded with the applied CSS style.
