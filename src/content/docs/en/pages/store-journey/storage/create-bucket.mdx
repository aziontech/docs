This guide shows how to use Azion's **Edge Storage** service to create a read-only bucket and assign read-write permissions using the Azion API. 

## Creating a bucket

Run the following `POST` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and `name` with the desired bucket name to create a new read-only bucket:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azion.com/v4/storage/buckets' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--data '{
    "name": "my-bucket-ro",
    "edge_access": "read_only"
}'
```

You should receive the following response:

```json
{
  "state": "executed",
  "data": {
    "name": "my-bucket-ro",
    "edge_access": "read_only"
  }
}
```

## Attributing read-write permission to bucket

Run the following `PATCH` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and `bucket_name` with the name of the bucket to attribute the read-write permission:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azion.com/v4/storage/buckets/<bucket_name>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--data '{
    "edge_access": "read_write"
}'
```

You should receive the following response:

```json
{
  "state": "executed",
  "data": {
    "name": "my-bucket-ro",
    "edge_access": "read_write"
  }
}
```

Now, you have successfully created a bucket and attributed read-write permissions to it. You can start storing and retrieving objects from this bucket.
