This guide walks you through deleting an Edge Storage bucket using the Azion API and Azion CLI. 

## Deleting a bucket

<Tabs client:visible>
    <Fragment slot="tab.cli">Azion CLI</Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.api">API</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.cli">

### Requirements 

- [Azion CLI installed](/en/documentation/products/azion-cli/overview/#installing-azion-cli). 
- [A personal token configured](/en/documentation/devtools/cli/globals/#token).

To delete a bucket: 

```bash 
azion delete edge-storage bucket --name yourbucketname
```

</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.api">
 
Run the following `DELETE` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and `bucket_name` with the name of the bucket you want to delete:

```bash
curl --location --request DELETE 'https://api.azion.com/v4/storage/buckets/bucket_name' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]'
```

You'll receive a response similar to this: 

```bash 
/{"state":"executed","data":{"name":"bucketname","edge_access":"read_only"}}% 
```
</Fragment>

</Tabs>
