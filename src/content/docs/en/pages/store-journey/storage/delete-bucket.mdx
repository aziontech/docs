## Requirements 

- [Azion CLI installed](/en/documentation/products/azion-cli/overview/#installing-azion-cli).

Run the following `DELETE` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and `bucket_name` with the name of the bucket you want to delete:

```bash
curl --location --request DELETE 'https://api.azion.com/v4/storage/buckets/bucket_name' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]'
```

Response: 

```bash 
/{"state":"executed","data":{"name":"bucketname","edge_access":"read_only"}}% 
```
