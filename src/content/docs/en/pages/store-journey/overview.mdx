Welcome to the Azion Store Products journey. This documentation introduces [SQL Database](/en/documentation/products/store/edge-sql/) and [Object Storage](/en/documentation/products/store/edge-storage/), powerful tools for efficient data management and processing.

## Object Storage

Azion Object Storage is an object storage model that organizes data into "buckets" for efficient organization. It supports the S3-compatible API, classifies data operations into classes, and incorporates data replication in its architecture. Key features include S3-compatible API, public buckets, integration with Functions, globally distributed, Integration with Azion's network, and granular permissions.

### Object Storage Use Cases & Applications

Object Storage is ideal for backup and recovery, content management, rich media, static-site hosting, storage of unstructured data, and Jamstack websites.

## SQL Database

Azion SQL Database is a cutting-edge SQL solution tailored for edge computing, providing ultra-low latency querying to enhance serverless applications. It's fully ACID-compliant and uses SQLite's dialect, offering developers a familiar environment. Its architecture implements Main/Replicas for data resilience, ensuring fault tolerance through replication across the Azion Global Infrastructure.

### SQL Database use cases and applications

SQL Database is suitable for real-time telemetry data storage, access log analysis, efficient access data management, and supporting applications requiring quick data retrieval.
