Welcome to the Azion Store Products journey. This documentation introduces [Edge SQL](/en/documentation/products/store/edge-sql/) and [Edge Storage](/en/documentation/products/store/edge-storage/), powerful tools for efficient data management and processing.

## Edge Storage

Azion Edge Storage is an object storage model that organizes data into "buckets" for efficient organization. It supports the S3-compatible API, classifies data operations into classes, and incorporates data replication in its architecture. Key features include S3-compatible API, public buckets, integration with Edge Functions, globally distributed, Integration with Azion's network, and granular permissions.

### Edge Storage Use Cases & Applications

Edge Storage is ideal for backup and recovery, content management, rich media, static-site hosting, storage of unstructured data, and Jamstack websites.
