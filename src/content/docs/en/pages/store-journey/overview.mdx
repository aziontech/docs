Welcome to Azion's Store products journey documentation. Here, we introduce you to [Edge SQL]() and [Edge Storage](), our powerful tools for efficient data management and processing.

## Edge Storage

Azion Edge Storage is an object storage model that organizes data into "buckets" for efficient organization. It supports the S3-compatible API, classifies data operations into three classes, and incorporates data replication in its architecture. Key features include S3-Compatible API, Public Buckets, Integration with Edge Functions, Globally Distributed, Integration with Azion CDN, and Granular Permissions.

### Edge Storage Use Cases & Applications

Edge Storage is ideal for Backup and Recovery, Content Management, Rich Media, Static Site Hosting, Storage of Unstructured Data, and Jamstack Websites.
