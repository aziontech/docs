Once you create an edge application with Azion, you have a range of configurations you can modify. In this guide, you'll learn to modify the protocols, delivery ports, and the encryption type that your application uses to interface with your end-users.

:::note

:::

## Via RTM

In this section, you'll modify some configurations of your application. You can see if the changes ocurred by [accessing your Azion domain](/en/documentation/products/guides/configure-a-domain/).

1. [Access RTM](https://manager.azion.com).
2. On the upper-left corner of the page, open the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, and select **Edge Application**.
3. Click the edge application you want to configure. From this screen, you can alter the application's name, delivery settings, and which modules it uses.

The following steps will guide you through editing an edge application's settings for a boilerplate application. Feel free to change these settings whenever necessary to suit your requirements.

### Delivery protocols

Modify your application to support the available [delivery protocols](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/main-settings/#delivery-protocols).

1. Go to the **Main Settings** tab.
2. Under **Delivery Protocol**, switch to **HTTP & HTTPS**.
3. Click the **Save** button.

After some propagation time, you'll be able to access your edge application using the HTTPS protocol. To test it, access the `https://xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net` address. You should still see the configured application, only now the request was made using a more secure protocol.

You can also make the following cURL request in your terminal with the HTTPS schema:

```bash
curl -I https://xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/
```

If you receive a `2xx` or `3xx` response, it means your application is running on HTTPS protocol.

:::note
HTTP applications are automatically protected by the Azion SAN certificate. However, HTTPS applications require a [custom certificate](/en/documentation/products/guides/create-a-digital-certificate/).
:::

### Delivery ports

Choose between the supported [delivery ports](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/main-settings/#ports) for each protocol selected.

1. Go to the **Main Settings** tab.
2. Under **Ports HTTP**, in addition to port `80`, select port `8008`.
3. Under **Ports HTTPS**, in addition to port `443`, select port `8443`.
4. Click the **Save** button.

Wait a few minutes for the changes to propagate to the edge and try to access your application using one of the new ports; for example, navigate to `https://xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net:8443` and check if your application is running on the custom port.

Alternatively, you can make the following cURL request from your terminal:

```bash
curl -I https://xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net:8443
```

A successful response means your application is also running on port `8443`.

### TLS cipher suite and version

Specify the [minimum TLS version](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/main-settings/#minimum-tls-version) and [cipher suite](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/main-settings/#ciphers) supported by your application.

1. Go to the **Main Settings** tab.
2. Under **Minimum TLS version**, select **TLS 1.2**.
3. Under **Supported Ciphers list**, select **TLSv1.2_2021**.
4. Click the **Save** button.

It may take some time to propagate your changes to the edge. To verify whether your changes took place, you can inspect the `https://xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net` page using your browser and locate the security settings of the application. You can also [run the DIG command](/en/documentation/products/guides/run-the-dig-command/) to get more information on your security settings.

The application may still be running in TLS 1.3, since you selected the minimum version and not the exact TLS version. However, you can check the cipher suite being used against the [list of supported ciphers](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/main-settings/#ciphers).

### Modules

[Modules](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/#modules) can unlock additional functionalities and features for your applications. See the [Pricing page](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/) for more details.

For now, you'll enable two modules. The **Application Acceleration** and **Edge Functions** modules will be used for when you [tune your cache settings](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/tune-cache-settings/), [instantiate an edge function](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/instantiate-edge-functions/), and [work with Rules Engine](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/work-with-rules-engine/). 

If you're an [Account owner](/en/documentation/products/guides/users-management/), start by enabling the following modules for your account:

1. [Access RTM](https://manager.azion.com).
2. On the top-right corner, click the **Account menu**.
3. Select **Billing & Subscriptions**.
4. Navigate to the **Subscriptions** tab.
5. Enable the **Application Acceleration** and **Edge Functions** switches.
6. Click the **Save** button.

:::note[Optional]
You may also take this chance to update your payment method on the **Payment Methods** tab.
:::

7. On the upper-left corner of the page, open the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, and then select **Edge Application**.
8. Click the edge application you want to configure.
9. Enable the modules **Application Acceleration** and **Edge Functions**.
10. Click the **Save** button.

## Via API

1. Run the following `GET` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) to retrieve your `<edge_application_id>`:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_applications \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]'
```

2. You'll receive a response with all your existing edge applications. Copy the value of the `<edge_application_id>` that you want to configure.
3. Run a `PATCH` request to modify the application as follows:

```bash
curl --location --request PATCH 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_applications/<edge_application_id>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--data '{
    "delivery_protocol": "http,https",
    "http_port": [80, 8008],
    "https_port": [443, 8443],
    "minimum_tls_version": "tls_1_2",
    "supported_ciphers": "TLSv1.2_2021",
    "edge_functions": true,
    "application_acceleration": true
}'
```

  | Key | Description |
  | --- | --- |
  | `delivery_protocol` | When set to `http,https`, enables the HTTPS protocol support. |
  | `http_port` | Sets new HTTPS ports to the application. In this case, the array `[80, 8008]` defines that both ports 80 and 8008 can be used by HTTP requests. |
  | `https_port` | Sets new HTTPS ports to the application. In this case, the array `[443, 8443]` defines that both ports 443 and 8443 can be used by HTTP requests. |
  | `minimum_tls_version` | When set to `tls_1_2`, establishes that the minimum TLS version should be 1.2. |
  | `supported_ciphers` | Sets the supported cipher suite, with its value in this case being `TLSv1.2_2021`. See the full list of [list of supported ciphers](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/main-settings/#ciphers) for further details.
  | `edge_functions` | Enables the **Edge Functions** module. |
  | `application_acceleration` | Enables the **Application Acceleration** module. |

4. You'll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
    "results": {
        "id": <edge_application_id>,
        "name": "example.org",
        "delivery_protocol": "http,https",
        "http_port": [
            80,
            8008
        ],
        "https_port": [
            443,
            8443
        ],
        "minimum_tls_version": "tls_1_2",
        "active": true,
        "debug_rules": false,
        "http3": false,
        "websocket": false,
        "supported_ciphers": "TLSv1.2_2021",
        "application_acceleration": true,
        "caching": true,
        "device_detection": false,
        "edge_firewall": false,
        "edge_functions": true,
        "image_optimization": false,
        "l2_caching": false,
        "load_balancer": false,
        "raw_logs": false,
        "web_application_firewall": false
    }
}
```

5. Wait a few minutes for the changes to propagate.
6. Test your changes by accessing your application using the HTTPS protocol and custom ports configured above. You can access your application through a browser using the address `https://xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net:8443` and inspect the page or use the following cURL command for a `2xx` or `3xx` status response:

```bash
curl -I https://xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net:8443
```

7. Check the supported cipher suite by inspecting the page or [running the DIG command](/en/documentation/products/guides/run-the-dig-command/).
