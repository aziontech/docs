Once you create an edge application with Azion, you have a range of configurations you can modify. In this guide, you'll learn to modify the modules/add-ons that your application uses to interface with your end-users.

In this guide, you'll modify some configurations of your application. You can see if the changes ocurred by [accessing your Azion Workload](/en/documentation/products/guides/configure-a-workload/).

        1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Edge Application**.
        2. Click the edge application you want to configure. From this screen, you can alter the application's name, delivery settings, and which modules/add-ons it uses.

        The following steps will guide you through editing an edge application's settings for a boilerplate application. Feel free to change these settings whenever necessary to suit your requirements.

        **Add-ons**

        [Add-ons](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/#modules) can unlock additional functionalities and features for your applications. See the [Pricing page](/en/documentation/products/pricing/) for more details.

        For now, you'll enable two add-ons. The **Application Accelerator** and **Edge Functions** add-ons will be used for when you [tune your cache settings](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/tune-cache-settings/), [instantiate an edge function](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/instantiate-edge-functions/), and [work with Rules Engine](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/work-with-rules-engine/). 

        Next, to enable the add-ons for your application:

        3. Go to the **Main Settings**.
        4. Enable the add-ons **Application Accelerator** and **Edge Functions**.
        5. Click the **Save** button.

        1. Run the following `GET` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) to retrieve your `<edge_application_id>`:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/v4/edge_application/applications' \
     --header 'Accept: application/json;' \
     --header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]'
```

        2.  You'll receive a response with all your existing edge applications. Copy the value of the `<edge_application_id>` that you want to configure.
        3.  Run a `PATCH` request to modify the application as follows:

```bash
curl --location --request PATCH 'https://api.azionapi.net/v4/edge_application/applications/<application_id>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json;' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--data '{

    "edge_functions": true,
    "application_acceleration": true
}'
```

        | Key | Description |
        | --- | --- |
        | `edge_functions` | Enables the **Edge Functions** add-on |
        | `application_acceleration` | Enables the **Application Accelerator** add-on |

        4.  You'll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
        "state": "executed",
        "data": {
            "id": <edge_application_id>,
            "name": "string",
            "last_editor": "string",
            "last_modified": "2019-08-24T14:15:22Z",
            "add-ons": {
                "edge_cache_enabled": true,
                "edge_functions_enabled": true,
                "application_accelerator_enabled": true,
                "image_processor_enabled": false,
                "tiered_cache_enabled": false
            },
        "active": true,
        "debug": false,
        "product_version": "string"
        }
    }
```

        5.  Wait a few minutes for the changes to propagate.
        6.  Test your changes by accessing your application. You can access your application through a browser using the address `http://xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net:8008` and inspect the page or use the following cURL command for a `2xx` or `3xx` status response:

```bash
curl -I http://xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net:8008
```

        7.  Check the supported cipher suite by inspecting the page or [running the DIG command](/en/documentation/products/guides/run-the-dig-command/).
