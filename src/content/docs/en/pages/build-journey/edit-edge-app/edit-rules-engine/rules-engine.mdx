Implementing rules in your application using [Rules Engine](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/rules-engine/) will allow you to determine the tasks it should execute in specific scenarios without modifying your application's code.

:::caution[warning]
To unlock the full capabilities of Rules Engine, you should activate the [Application Accelerator](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/application-accelerator/) module. If **Application Accelerator** is activated, data transfer could generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/) for more information.
:::

This guide demonstrates the process of creating rules with a practical example, but most rules will be unique to each application and its needs. In addition to activating variables such as [device groups](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/create-device-groups/), [cache settings](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/cache-settings/), and [origins](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/work-with-origins/), you can create a wide variety of rules in both the request and response phases.

With this guide, you'll create a rule in the response phase to remove an HTTP header using the **Filter Response Header** behavior.

---

## Via Azion Console

To activate the **Application Accelerator** module:

1. [Access Azion Console](https://console.azion.com).
2. On the upper-left corner of the page, open the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, and select **Edge Application**.
3. Click the edge application you want to configure. 
4. Activate the **Application Accelerator** module.
5. Click the **Save** button.

The `Server` header stores information about the server that generated the response. By removing this header, end-users won't receive information about the infrastructure of your application, enhancing your security by reducing the information available to potential attackers.

:::note
Exercise caution when removing any headers from your edge application and ensure that this action doesn't interfere in any applicable standards and guidelines.
:::

To remove the `Server` header:

1. Navigate to the **Rules Engine** tab.
2. Click the **Add Rule** button.
3. On the dropdown menu, select **Response Phase**.
4. Give your rule a name and, if necessary, a description.
5. In the **Criteria** section, select the `${uri}` variable.
6. As a comparison operator, select **starts with**.
7. As an argument, add the value `/`.
8. In the Behaviors section, select **Filter Response Header**.
9. As an argument, add `Server`.
10. Click the **Save** button.

## Via API

1. Run the following `PATCH` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and the `<edge_application_id>` variable with [your edge application ID](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/configure-main-settings/) to activate the [Application Accelerator](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/application-accelerator/) module:

```bash
curl --location --request PATCH 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_applications/<edge_application_id>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--data '{
    "application_acceleration": true
}'
```

2. You'll receive a response with the updated value.
3. Run the following `POST` request to create a rule in the response phase, replacing `<edge_application_id>` with the `id` value you received in the previous response:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_applications/<edge_application_id>/rules_engine/response/rules' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "name": "FilterRespHeader Server",
    "behaviors": [
        {
            "name": "filter_response_header",
            "target": "Server"
        }
    ],
    "criteria": [
        [
            {
                "variable": "${uri}",
                "operator": "is_equal",
                "conditional": "if",
                "input_value": "/"
            }
        ]
    ]
}'
```

4. You'll receive the following response:

```json
{
    "results": {
        "id": <rule_id>,
        "name": "FilterRespHeader Server",
        "phase": "response",
        "behaviors": [
            {
                "name": "filter_response_header",
                "target": "Server"
            }
        ],
        "criteria": [
            [
                {
                    "variable": "${uri}",
                    "operator": "is_equal",
                    "conditional": "if",
                    "input_value": "/"
                }
            ]
        ],
        "is_active": true,
        "order": 1,
        "description": null
    }
}
```

5. Wait a few minutes for the changes to propagate.
