Configure your edge application to handle error responses from the origin using [Error Responses](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/error-responses/). Azion allows you to set a cache TTL for error pages, a custom path, or deliver another HTTP code in the response without needing to change the source code of your application.

With this guide, you'll modify the default error response of your application, setting a cache TTL for each error received from the origin.

---

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Edge Application**.
2. Click the edge application you want to configure.
3. Select the **Error Responses** tab.

In the **Error Responses** section, the **Status Code** field can't be modified. This field represents every error status code received from the origin. The **Default Response TTL** field allows you to customize the cache TTL for every status code received.

4. In **Default Response TTL**, set the cache *time-to-live* (TTL), in seconds, for all error pages.
5. Click the **+ Error Response** button.
6. In the new **Status Code** field, select the status code you want to customize. For example: `404`.
7. Add a cache TTL in the **Custom Response TTL** field.

You can also determine a specific path from your origin that will be delivered to the user and a custom status code in the response. These modifications are optional.

8. In the **Page Path** field, add a *path* to an error page created in the source. For example: `/error/404`.
9. In the **Response Status Code** field, customize the HTTP status that'll be received by the user.
10. In the **Set Origin** section, select the origin of error page URIs.
11. Click the **Save** button.

When errors are received from the origin, your edge application will cache and display the error page based on the new configuration.
