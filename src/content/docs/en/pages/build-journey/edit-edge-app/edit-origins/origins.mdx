Define [an origin](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/origins/) to determine the source of the content of your application. It can be an application, a web server, or a storage.

When you [create an edge application](/en/documentation/products/start-with-a-template/), a default origin is created and activated automatically. This guide will show you how to create and activate a new origin with different configurations without removing or editing the default origin.

If you're not sure which steps apply to your account, see [this guide](/en/documentation/products/guides/verify-account-migration/) to determine if your account has already been migrated.

To configure origins via Workloads:

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Workloads**.
2. Select your workload.
3. Navigate to **Deployment Settings**.
4. In **Origins**, click **+ Origin**.
5. Configure the origin name, address, and settings as needed.
6. Click **Save**.

:::note
With Workloads, origins are configured as part of the deployment settings and rules for routing to specific origins are handled automatically based on your workload configuration.

To configure origins via traditional Domains interface:

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Edge Application**.
2. Click the edge application for which you want to configure a new origin.
3. Select the **Origins** tab.
4. Click the **+ Origin** button.
5. Give your new origin a name. For example: `httpbin.org`
6. Under **Type**, keep the option **Single Origin** selected.

:::tip
To implement load balancing algorithm for multiple origins, see the [guide on multiple origins with Load Balancer](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/multiple-origins/).
:::

7. Under **Protocol Policy**, select **Enforce HTTPS**.
8. Under **Address**, add `httpbin.org`
9. Under **Host Header**, add `customhost.com`.
10. Leave **Path** blank.
11. Click the **Save** button.

:::note
If your origin is under a host followed by a path, such as `https://bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/applications/your-app`, you must separate the URL and add the host `bucket.s3.amazonaws.com` into the **Address** field and add the path `/applications/your-app` into the **Origin path** field.
:::

You've created a new origin, but it isn't active in your application yet. You need to define what will trigger a request to the new origin. 

1. Navigate to the **Rules Engine** tab.
2. Click the **+ Rule** button.
3. Give a name for your rule.
4. Select **Request Phase**.
5. Under the **Criteria** section, select the variable `${uri}`.

:::note
The `${uri}` variable may already be selected by default if you didn't activate **Application Accelerator**. For more information on Edge Application modules, see the [Edge Application documentation](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/#modules).
:::

6. As a comparison operator, select **is equal**.
7. As an argument, add `/httpbin`.
8. In the **Behaviors** section, select **Set Origin** from the behavior list.
9. Select the new origin you created.
10. Click the **Save** button.
11. Wait a few minutes for the changes to propagate and access `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/httpbin`.

To configure origins via API v4:

1. Create a new origin:

<Code lang="bash" code={`curl --request POST \\
  --url https://api.azion.com/v4/edge_applications/<edge_application_id>/origins \\
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \\
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\
  --header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \\
  --data '{
    "name": "httpbin.org SO HTTPS Host:customhost.com",
    "origin_type": "single_origin",
    "addresses": [
      {
        "address": "httpbin.org"
      }
    ],
    "origin_protocol_policy": "https",
    "host_header": "customhost.com"
  }'`} />

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | Sets the string in value as a name of the origin |
| `origin_type` | Sets the new origin type to `single_origin` |
| `addresses` | Takes a list of objects for each address of the origin |
| `origin_protocol_policy` | When `https`, enforces an HTTPS connection with the origin |
| `host_header` | Sets the string in value as the value of the `Host` header sent to the origin |

2. Create a Rules Engine rule to activate the origin:

<Code lang="bash" code={`curl --request POST \\
  --url https://api.azion.com/v4/edge_applications/<edge_application_id>/rules_engine/request/rules \\
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \\
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\
  --header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \\
  --data '{
    "name": "Set httpbin /httpbin",
    "behaviors": [
      {
        "name": "set_origin",
        "target": "<origin_id>"
      }
    ],
    "criteria": [
      [
        {
          "variable": "${uri}",
          "operator": "is_equal",
          "conditional": "if",
          "argument": "/httpbin"
        }
      ]
    ]
  }'`} />

To configure origins via API v3:

1. Run the following `POST` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and the `<edge_application_id>` variable with [your edge application ID](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/configure-main-settings/):

<Code lang="bash" code={`curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_applications/<edge_application_id>/origins' \\
  --header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \\
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\
  --header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \\
  --data '{
    "name": "httpbin.org SO HTTPS Host:customhost.com",
    "origin_type": "single_origin",
    "addresses": [
      {
        "address": "httpbin.org"
      }
    ],
    "origin_protocol_policy": "https",
    "host_header": "customhost.com"
  }'`} />

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | Sets the string in value as a name of the origin |
| `origin_type` | Sets the new origin type to `single_origin`. For more information on load balancing, check [Work with multiple origins](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/multiple-origins/) |
| `addresses` | Takes a list of objects for each address of the origin. Since this is an entry of the single origin type, you may only send one object with the `address` value in the array |
| `origin_protocol_policy` | When `https`, enforces an HTTPS connection with the origin, not affecting the protocol from user requests |
| `host_header` | Sets the string in value as the value of the `Host` header sent to the origin |

2. You'll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
  "results": {
    "origin_id": <origin_id>,
    "origin_key": <origin_key>,
    "name": "httpbin.org SO HTTPS Host:customhost.com",
    "origin_type": "single_origin",
    "addresses": [
      {
        "address": "httpbin.org",
        "weight": null,
        "server_role": "primary",
        "is_active": true
      }
    ],
    "origin_protocol_policy": "https",
    "is_origin_redirection_enabled": false,
    "host_header": "customhost.com",
    "method": "",
    "origin_path": "",
    "connection_timeout": 60,
    "timeout_between_bytes": 120,
    "hmac_authentication": false,
    "hmac_region_name": "",
    "hmac_access_key": "",
    "hmac_secret_key": ""
  }
}
```

:::caution[warning]
Endpoints that require origin identification use the `origin_key` value. For example, a `PATCH` request for an origin must be made to the URL `https://api.azionapi.net/edge_applications/<edge_application_id>/origins/<origin_key>`. This doesn't apply to cases when you must reference an origin outside the `/origins/` endpoints, such as when creating a new rule to activate your origin.
:::

3. Run the following `POST` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/), the `<edge_application_id>` variable with [your edge application ID](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/configure-main-settings/), and the `<origin_id>` variable with the origin ID from when you [created a new origin via API](#via-api):

<Code lang="bash" code={`curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_applications/<edge_application_id>/rules_engine/request/rules' \\
  --header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \\
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\
  --header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \\
  --data '{
    "name": "Set httpbin /httpbin",
    "behaviors": [
      {
        "name": "set_origin",
        "target": "<origin_id>"
      }
    ],
    "criteria": [
      [
        {
          "variable": "${uri}",
          "operator": "is_equal",
          "conditional": "if",
          "input_value": "/httpbin"
        }
      ]
    ]
  }'`} />

4. You'll receive a response confirming that the rule was created.
5. Wait a few minutes for the changes to propagate and access `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/httpbin`. Also, try accessing any other unconfigured URI: you should receive a `404` error.
