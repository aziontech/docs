Define [an origin](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/origins/) to determine the source of the content of your application. It can be an application, a web server, or a storage.

When you [create an edge application](/en/documentation/products/start-with-a-template/), a default origin is created and activated automatically. This guide will show you how to create and activate a new origin with different configurations without removing or editing the default origin.

---

## Via RTM

1. [Access RTM](https://manager.azion.com).
2. On the upper-left corner of the page, open the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, and then select **Edge Application**.
3. Click the edge application for which you want to configure a new origin.
4. Select the **Origins** tab.
5. Click the **Add Origin** button.
6. Give your new origin a name. For example: `httpbin.org`
7. Under **Origin Type**, keep the option **Single Origin** selected.

:::tip
To implement load balancing algorithm for multiple origins, see the [guide on multiple origins with Load Balancer](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/multiple-origins/).
:::

8. Under **Host Header**, add `customhost.com`.
9. Leave **Origin Path** blank.
10. Under **Origin Protocol Policy**, select **Enforce HTTPS**.
11. Under **Address**, add `httpbin.org`.
12. Click the **Save** button.

:::note
If your origin is under a host followed by a path, such as `https://bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/applications/your-app`, you must separate the URL and add the host `bucket.s3.amazonaws.com` into the **Address** field and add the path `/applications/your-app` into the **Origin path** field.
:::

You've created a new origin, but it isn't active in your application yet. You need to define what will trigger a request to the new origin. 

1. Navigate to the **Rules Engine** tab.
2. Click the **Add Rule** button and select **Request Phase**.
3. Under the **Criteria** section, select the variable `${uri}`.

:::note
The `${uri}` variable may already be selected by default if you didn't activate **Application Acceleration**. For more information on Edge Application modules, see the [Edge Application documentation](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/#modules).
:::

4. As a comparison operator, select **is equal**.
5. As an argument, add `/httpbin`.
6. In the **Behaviors** section, select **Set Origin** from the behavior list.
7. Select the new origin you created.
8. Click the **Save** button.
9. Wait a few minutes for the changes to propagate and access `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/httpbin`.

## Via API

1. Run the following `POST` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and the `<edge_application_id>` variable with [your edge application ID](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/configure-main-settings/):

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_applications/<edge_application_id>/origins' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--data '{
        "name": "httpbin.org SO HTTPS Host:customhost.com",
        "origin_type": "single_origin",
        "addresses": [
            {
                "address": "httpbin.org"
            }
        ],
        "origin_protocol_policy": "https",
        "host_header": "customhost.com"
}'
```

  | Key | Description |
  | --- | --- |
  | `name` | Sets the string in value as a name of the origin. |
  | `origin_type` | Sets the new origin type to `single_origin`. For more information on load balancing, check [Work with multiple origins](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/multiple-origins/). |
  | `addresses` | Takes a list of objects for each address of the origin. Since this is an entry of the single origin type, you may only send one object with the `address` value in the array. |
  | `origin_protocol_policy` | When `https`, enforces an HTTPS connection with the origin, not affecting the protocol from user requests. |
  | `host_header` | Sets the string in value as the value of the `Host` header sent to the origin. |

2. You'll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
    "results": {
        "origin_id": <origin_id>,
        "origin_key": <origin_key>,
        "name": "httpbin.org SO HTTPS Host:customhost.com",
        "origin_type": "single_origin",
        "addresses": [
            {
                "address": "httpbin.org",
                "weight": null,
                "server_role": "primary",
                "is_active": true
            }
        ],
        "origin_protocol_policy": "https",
        "is_origin_redirection_enabled": false,
        "host_header": "customhost.com",
        "method": "",
        "origin_path": "",
        "connection_timeout": 60,
        "timeout_between_bytes": 120,
        "hmac_authentication": false,
        "hmac_region_name": "",
        "hmac_access_key": "",
        "hmac_secret_key": ""
    }
}
```

:::caution[warning]
Endpoints that require origin identification use the `origin_key` value. For example, a `PATCH` request for an origin must be made to the URL `https://api.azionapi.net/edge_applications/<edge_application_id>/origins/<origin_key>`. This doesn't apply to cases when you must reference an origin outside the `/origins/` endpoints, such as when creating a new rule to activate your origin.
:::

3. Run the following `POST` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/), the `<edge_application_id>` variable with [your edge application ID](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/configure-main-settings/), and the `<origin_id>` variable with the origin ID from when you [created a new origin via API](#via-api):

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_applications/<edge_application_id>/rules_engine/request/rules' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--data '{
    "name": "Set httpbin /httpbin",
    "behaviors": [
        {
            "name": "set_origin",
            "target": "<origin_id>"
        }
    ],
    "criteria": [
        [
            {
                "variable": "${uri}",
                "operator": "is_equal",
                "conditional": "if",
                "input_value": "/httpbin"
            }
        ]
    ]
}'
```

4. You'll receive a response confirming that the rule was created.
5. Wait a few minutes for the changes to propagate and access `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/httpbin`. Also, try accessing any other unconfigured URI: you should receive a `404` error.

Check the [Azion API documentation](https://api.azion.com/) and the [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/aziontech/azionapi-openapi/) to know more about all features available via API.
