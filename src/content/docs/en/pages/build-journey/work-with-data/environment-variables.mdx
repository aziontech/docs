Environment variables are a crucial aspect of software development and deployment. 
They are used to store sensitive information or configuration settings that shouldn't be hardcoded into the codebase.

They offer some key benefits: 

- Security

- Configuration flexibility

- Portability

- Collaboration

- Version control

- Compliance

The environment variables can be managed through the [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/) and used inside edge functions by calling the `Azion.env.get()` interface.
