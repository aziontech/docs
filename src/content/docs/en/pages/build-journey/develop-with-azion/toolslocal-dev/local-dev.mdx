In the rapidly evolving landscape of edge computing, the ability to develop and test applications locally is crucial for efficient and effective development workflows.

- Initialization and Application Building.
- Adaptation for Edge
- Local Development Server
- Efficient Debugging and Testing
- Accelerated Development Workflow
- Enhanced Collaboration
