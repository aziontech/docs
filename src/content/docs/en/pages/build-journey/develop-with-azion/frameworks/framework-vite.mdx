VitePress is listed on [the Jamstack documentation](https://jamstack.org/generators/vitepress/) as a static site generator, aligned to the Jamstack approach. It is powered by [Vue](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html).

## Initializing a VitePress project on the edge

Now, it's time to initialize a VitePress project using the Azion CLI.

1. Initialize the project:

```sh 
  azion init
```

2. Give your project a name, or press `enter` to accept the given suggestion:

```sh
? Your application's name:  (black-thor)
```

3. Choose the VitePress preset:

```sh 
? Choose a preset:  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
  Angular
  Astro
  Docusaurus
  Eleventy
  Emscripten
  Gatsby
  Hexo
  Hono
  Hugo
  Javascript
  Jekyll
  Next
  React
  Rustwasm
  Svelte
  Typescript
> Vitepress
  Vue
```

4. Choose one of the available templates.

5. With the template fetched and configured, you can now start a local development server.

```sh
Do you want to start a local development server? (y/N) 
```

The following steps are based on the answer you gave. 

- [If you chose to have a local development server running](/en/documentation/products/cli/frameworks/vite/#answering-yes-to-local-dev).
- [If you chose not to have a local development server running](/en/documentation/products/cli/frameworks/vite/#answering-no-to-local-dev).

### Answering yes to local dev

1. Install the project dependencies. Input `y` when the interaction prompts:

```sh
  Do you want to install project dependencies? This may be required to start local development server (y/N)
```

Wait until the installation is complete.

Output:

```sh
Your Edge Application was built successfully
[Azion] [Server] › ✔  success   Function running on port 0.0.0.0:3333, url: http://localhost:3333
```

2. On the browser, go to `http://localhost:3333/` and you can now see your VitePress project running.

#### Deploying the project

When your project is running locally, you're still able to deploy it to the edge. To do so: 

1. Stop the terminal execution with `control + c`.
2. Access the project folder:

```sh
cd [your-project-name] 
```

3. Deploy the project:

```sh
azion deploy
```

4. Wait while the project is built and deployed to the Azion Edge Platform.

:::note 
Once the deployment is triggered, Azion will open the browser and take the user to a page on Azion Console where the deployment logs and process can be monitored. If it doesn't open automatically, just click on the provided link.
::: 

After the deployment is complete, you'll receive a domain to access your VitePress project on the Azion's platform.

Wait a few minutes so the propagation takes place, and then access your application using the provided domain, which should be similar to `https://xxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`.

### Answering no to local dev

Now, after indicating you don't want to have a local server running, deploy your VitePress project to the edge.

1. Enter `y` to the following interaction, indicating you want to deploy the project:

```sh
   Do you want to deploy your project? (y/N) 
```

2. Install the project dependencies. Input `y` when the interaction prompts:

```sh 
  Do you want to install project dependencies? This may be required to deploy your project (y/N)
```

3. Wait while the project is built and deployed to the Azion Edge Platform.

:::note 
Once the deployment is triggered, Azion will open the browser and take the user to a page on Azion Console where the deployment logs and process can be monitored. If it doesn't open automatically, just click on the provided link.

After the deployment is complete, you'll receive a domain to access your VitePress project on the Azion's platform.
