The **Jamstack** architecture at the edge has emerged as a game-changing paradigm, 
combining the power of serverless computing with the efficiency of edge locations. At its core, Jamstack, 
which stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup, decentralizes traditional web server functions, pushing them closer to the user. 
This shift not only accelerates website loading times but also enhances security and scalability.

## Azion CLI 

At Azion, you can initialize, build, secure, and deploy applications making use of a list of frameworks. It's possible through the combination of [Azion Bundler](https://github.com/aziontech/bundler) and [Azion CLI](/en/documentation/products/azion-cli/overview/), which
makes the necessary adaptation for the frameworks to run as they should on the Azion Web Platform.

The following table brings **some** of the frameworks that are adapted to the edge: 

| Framework | CLI | Console |

| Angular | [How to build with Angular](/en/documentation/products/cli/frameworks/angular/) | [Angular boilerplate](/en/documentation/products/guides/angular-boilerplate/) |
