## Requirements

Before getting started, you must have:

- An [Azion platform account](/en/documentation/products/accounts/creating-account/) with [Edge Functions](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-functions/) enabled.
- [The latest version of Azion CLI installed](/en/documentation/products/azion-cli/overview/).
- Code editor.
- Access to the terminal.
- Node.js ≥ 18.

## Initializing a Next project on the edge

1. Initialize the project:

```sh 
  azion init
```

2. Accept the suggested name to your project, or enter the name you choose:

```sh 
(Hit enter to accept the suggested name in parentheses) Your project's name:  (dynamic_caligari)
```

Output: 

```sh
Getting templates available
```

3. Choose the Next template: 

```sh 
Getting templates available? Choose a template for your project: (Use arrow keys)
  Angular 
  Astro 
  Hexo 
 ❯Next 
  React 
  Vue 
  Vite 
```

4. Choose the template: 

```sh
? Choose the template: (Use arrow keys)
❯ Next 13 - Static (export) 
  Next 13 - Azion Runtime (App Router)  
  Next 13 - Azion Runtime (Pages Router) 
  Next 12 - Node Runtime (Edge compatible with polyfills) 
```

Now, Next's CLI will follow the process and initialize your Next project.

5. A series of interactions will be prompted, answer them as you prefer.

The following steps are based on the answer you gave when asked about local development. 

- [If you chose to have a local development server running](/en/documentation/products/cli/frameworks/next/#answering-yes-to-local-dev).
- [If you chose not to have a local development server running](/en/documentation/products/cli/frameworks/next/#answering-no-to-local-dev).

### Answering yes to local dev

1. Install the project dependencies. Input `y` when the interaction prompts:

```sh 
  Do you want to install project dependencies? This may be required to start local development server (y/N)
```

Wait until the installation is complete.

Output:

```sh
Your Edge Application was built successfully
[Azion Bundler] [Server] › ✔  success   Function running on port http://localhost:3000/
```

2. On the browser, go to `http://localhost:3000/`, and you can now see your Next project running.

#### Deploying the project

When your project is running locally, you're still able to deploy it to the edge. To do so: 

1. Stop the terminal execution with `control + c`. 
2. Access the project folder:

```sh
cd [your-project-name] 
```

3. Deploy the project: 

```sh
azion deploy
```

4. Wait while the project is built and deployed to the Azion Edge Platform.

After the deployment is complete, you'll receive a domain to access your Next project on the Azion's platform.

Wait a few minutes so the propagation takes place, and then access your application using the provided domain, which should be similar to `https://xxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`.

### Answering no to local dev

Now, after indicating you don't want to have a local server running, deploy your Next project to the edge. 

1. Enter `y` to the following interaction, indicating you want to deploy the project:

```sh
   Do you want to deploy your project? (y/N) 
```

2. Install the project dependencies. Input `y` when the interaction prompts:

```sh 
  Do you want to install project dependencies? This may be required to deploy your project (y/N)
```

3. Wait while the project is built and deployed to the Azion edge platform.

:::note 
Once the deploy is triggered, Azion will open the browser and take the user to a page on Azion Console where the deployment logs and process can be monitored. If it doesn't open automatically, just click on the provided link.
::: 


After the deployment is complete, you'll receive a domain to access your Next project on the Azion's platform.

Wait a few minutes so the propagation takes place, and then access your application using the provided domain, which should be similar to `https://xxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`.
