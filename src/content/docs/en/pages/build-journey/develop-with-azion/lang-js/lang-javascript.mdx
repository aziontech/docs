## Before you begin

To get started and excel as an edge developer, it's important to:

- Be familiar with JavaScript.
- Know the concept of [Strict mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode).
- Have an [account on Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/accounts/creating-account/).

Azion Functions works on the [Azion Runtime](/en/documentation/runtime/overview/), which is a set of tools that enable the development.

It's paramount to take a look at the list of available APIs, methods, and types. [Learn more about Azion Runtime](/en/documentation/runtime/overview/).

## Code Editor

The [Functions Code Editor](/en/documentation/products/applications/functions/runtime-api/code-editor/) provides a development experience similar to what developers are accustomed to. The [Functions ChatGPT Integration](/en/documentation/products/applications/functions/runtime-api/ai-integration/) helps you to write, refactor, and review code.

## Functions and Applications

To develop your first function for Applications:

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Functions**.
2. Click **+ Function**.
3. Choose a name for your function.
4. Write your function. But wait, before that, keep reading:

**Writing an function**

First, the functions for applications work based on a [fetch event](/en/documentation/products/applications/functions/runtime-apis/javascript/fetch/). It's initialized with an `addEventListener` function, passing `fetch` as the event type, and an event. For example:

```javascript
  addEventListener('fetch', event => {
      event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request));
    });
```

Second, it's necessary to define the behavior of the `handleRequest` function. This function has the `event.request` as the signature. This data can be used later on to implement the necessary logic, such as:

- Manipulate cookies.
- Implement a behavior based on the request method (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE).
- Access request metadata.

The `handleRequest` function can be defined as:

```javascript
  const html = `<!DOCTYPE html>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>This markup was generated by Azion - Functions.</p>
  </body>`
  
  async function handleRequest(request) {
    return new Response(html, {
      headers: {
        "content-type": "text/html;charset=UTF-8",
      },
    })
  }
```

In this example, the response will be the HTML content, declared previously by the const `html`. The headers can be manipulated as well, and in the example, the content type is set.

5. Click the **Save** button.

## Testing and Debugging

After writing your functions, you can preview the response and inspect the code. The preview simulates a request, and this simulation can be altered to meet the developer's needs.

Learn more about [Azion Preview Deployment](/en/documentation/products/applications/functions/runtime-api/preview-deployment/).

It's possible to debug the functions through:

- [Data Stream](/en/documentation/products/guides/debugging-functions-data-stream/)
- [GraphQL API](/en/documentation/products/guides/debugging-functions-graphql/)

## Function instantiation

Once you've saved your function, it's necessary to instantiate it in an application.
