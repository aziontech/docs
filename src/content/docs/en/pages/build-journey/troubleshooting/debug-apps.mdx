The debugging process allows checking if the rules, messages, and variables you've created are working properly. When you constantly debug an application or an edge function, you improve your monitoring process and you're able to identify errors and then fix them.


## Applications

To debug your application rules:

<LinkButton link="/en/documentation/products/guides/debug-rules/" label="Debug rules created with rules engine" severity="secondary" /> <br></br>

## Functions

To debug your functions:

<LinkButton link="/en/documentation/products/guides/debugging-functions-data-stream/" label="Debug functions on Data Stream" severity="secondary" /> <br></br>

<LinkButton link="/en/documentation/products/guides/debugging-functions-graphql/" label="Debug functions using graphql api" severity="secondary" /> <br></br>
