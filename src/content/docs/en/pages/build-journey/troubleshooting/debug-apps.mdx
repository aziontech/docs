The debugging process allows checking if the rules, messages, and variables you've created are working properly. When you constantly debug an application or an function, you improve your monitoring process and you're able to identify errors and then fix them.


## Applications

To debug your application rules:

<Button href="/en/documentation/products/guides/debug-rules/" label="Debug rules created with rules engine" type="primary" theme="light" /> <br></br>

## Functions

To debug your functions:

<Button href="/en/documentation/products/guides/debugging-functions-data-stream/" label="Debug functions on Data Stream" type="primary" theme="light" /> <br></br>

<Button href="/en/documentation/products/guides/debugging-functions-graphql/" label="Debug functions using graphql api" type="primary" theme="light" /> <br></br>
