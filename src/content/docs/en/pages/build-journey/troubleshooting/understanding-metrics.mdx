After creating edge applications and edge functions, you can also count on [Observe](/en/documentation/products/observe/) products to monitor their behaviors and how they're performing.

- [Real-Time Metrics](/en/documentation/products/observe/real-time-metrics/): access to charts with aggregated data to explore behaviors throughout longer periods of data storage.
- [GraphQL API](/en/documentation/devtools/graphql-api/overview/): access to aggragated and raw data via API with customized queries with only the data you request.
- [Real-Time Events](/en/documentation/products/observe/real-time-events/): access to logs with raw data to perform extensive analysis.

## Edge applications

To monitor your edge applications performance, behaviors, and accesses:

<LinkButton outlined link="/en/documentation/products/observe/real-time-metrics/#edge-applications" label="view aggregated metrics" variant="secondary" /> <br></br>

<LinkButton outlined link="/en/documentation/devtools/graphql-api/features/#datasets" label="query data" variant="secondary" /> <br></br>

<LinkButton outlined link="/en/documentation/products/observe/real-time-events/#edge-applications" label="view raw data" variant="secondary" /> 

## Edge functions

To monitor your edge functions invocations, performance, and accesses:

<LinkButton outlined link="/en/documentation/products/observe/real-time-metrics/#edge-functions" label="view aggregated metrics" variant="secondary" /> <br></br>

<LinkButton outlined link="/en/documentation/devtools/graphql-api/features/#datasets" label="query data" variant="secondary" /> <br></br>

<LinkButton outlined link="/en/documentation/products/observe/real-time-events/#edge-functions" label="view raw data" variant="secondary" />
