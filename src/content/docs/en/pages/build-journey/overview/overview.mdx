Azion Build products are your starting point for utilizing the power of edge computing in your applications.

## Edge Application

**Edge Application** allows you to build applications closer to end users, offering low latency processing at the edge. When you build an edge application, you can determine the origin of your content and configure the domain that will be used to deliver your application to end users.

Through the reverse proxy architecture, the edge processes user requests and maintains cached data, decentralizing object storage and optimizing data transfer rates and efficiency. This scalability allows you to adapt to the growth of traffic demand without overloading your infrastructure and reducing maintenance costs.

When a user requests content from your edge application, their browser converts the requested domain into a pre-set IP address via DNS resolution. This directs the request to an edge node, where all the processing of an application occurs. At this stage, in addition to security and observability customizations, the edge node processes and includes any security and observability modifications. The request then goes through each Edge Application configuration, and any cached content at the edge gets delivered directly. Following this, the system uses load balancing algorithms to distribute requests across multiple origins. Post mediation by the Azion Platform, the request reaches its origin that responds back. The edge once again processes this response before delivering it to the user.
