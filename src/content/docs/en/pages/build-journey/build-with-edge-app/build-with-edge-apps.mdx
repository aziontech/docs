[Edge Application](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/) allows you to create new applications and define the variables of your application. It also enables you to automate actions at the request-response level. 

Azion provides a range of tools to configure your edge applications: 

- [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com): provides a user-friendly interface to configure your application and monitor data.
- [Azion CLI](/en/documentation/products/build/develop-with-azion/cli/): enables the team to interact with Azion's system directly from the command line interface.
- [Azion API](https://api.azion.com): allows you to integrate and automate application deployment, scaling, and monitoring processes.
- [Azion SDK](/en/documentation/products/build/develop-with-azion/sdk/go/): improve the development of your Go application.
- [Terraform](/en/documentation/products/build/develop-with-azion/terraform-provider/): integrate your infrastructure with Azion using Terraform.
- [Azion Runtime](/en/documentation/products/build/develop-with-azion/runtime-apis/): leverage APIs for networking and data handling.

## Step 1: Configure application

After you [create your application](/en/documentation/products/start-with-a-template/), you can change the delivery protocols and ports, as well as the encryption type that it uses to interface with your end-users in [Workloads](/en/documentation/products/secure/workloads/). 

Start by [customizing your main settings](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/configure-main-settings/) and [linking your application to a domain](/en/documentation/products/guides/configure-a-domain/).

---

## Step 2: Set variables

Next, you can configure your application's behavior by setting variables and parameters that can be customized to fit its requirements. You can define the following instances:

- **Cache settings**: [tune edge cache settings](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/tune-cache-settings/) to reduce the load on origin servers and speed up delivery. Define values such as browse and edge cache expiration, large file optimization, cache keys, and adaptive delivery based on devices.
- **Edge Connector**: [adjust your origin settings](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/work-with-origins/) to fit the needs of your application and define the values of the `Host` header and origin address. 
- **Device groups**: [group end-users based on their devices](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/create-device-groups/), operating systems, or browsers with information provided by the `User-Agent` header.
- **Edge functions**: [instantiate edge functions](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/instantiate-edge-functions/) to minimize resource usage by processing at the edge.

Some variables may have already been created by default when you first built your application. You can edit your default settings or create new ones if necessary.

---

## Step 3: Activate settings

To use your variables, you need to [set up rules](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/work-with-rules-engine/) that trigger specific actions in your application. 

In both the request and response processing stages, you can tailor a set of rules to handle requests according to the requirements of your application. This allows you to automate responses to user interactions, manage data flow, and carry out tasks based on incoming requests or outgoing responses, all governed by conditional business logic.
