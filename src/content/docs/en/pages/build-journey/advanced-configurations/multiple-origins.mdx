When you [create an edge application](/en/documentation/products/start-with-a-template/), you need to define an origin. However, more complex and robust infrastructures may need multiple origins for the same application. The [Load Balancer](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-connector/load-balancer/) feture allows you to use load balancing algorithms to manage high access numbers and control the behaviors of your origin.

:::caution[warning]
If **Load Balancer** is activated, data transfer could generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](/en/documentation/products/pricing/) for more information.
:::

There are separate instructions for API v3 using [legacy Origin](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/domains/) settings and API v4 using the new [Edge Connector](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-connector) product.

:::tip
If you're not sure which steps apply to your account, see [this guide](/en/documentation/products/guides/verify-account-migration/) to determine if your account has already been migrated.
:::

The following steps will walk you through a hypothetical scenario where the default origin should be of the Load Balancer-type with the [Round Robin algorithm](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/load-balancer/#balancing-method). Feel free to interpret and modify the step-by-step instructions according to your specific use case.

The following business rules of different origin servers must be configured with load balancing:

- The application should have three origins.
  - The primary server should have a higher load capacity.
  - The secondary server should have a medium load capacity, enough to handle large surges of incoming traffic.
  - The backup server should have a low load capacity and only be active in special circumstances.
- Each of these servers should be hosted in a different storage provider or cloud service since server outages don't often occur simultaneously.
- All origins must contain the same content and be set up in the exact same way for the edge application.

Therefore, the setup would be:

| Origin | Role | Address | Load capacity | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Primary server | `example.com` | High load capacity | Should always be active. |
| 2 | Secondary server | `example.net` | Medium load capacity | Should always be active. |
| 3 | Backup server | `example.org` | Low load capacity | Should only be active in case of maintenance or traffic surges. |

Now you need to configure a new **Edge Connector** to link your application to your Edge Storage bucket. To do so:

1. [Access Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Edge Connector**.
2. Click the **+ Edge Connector** button.
3. In the **General** section, give your connector a unique and descriptive name (for example, `Multiple Origins Edge Connector`.
4. In the **Connector Type** section, select **HTTP**.
5. Enable the **Load Balancer** switch, this enables you to add multiple addresses.
6. In the **Method** field, select **Round-Robin**.
7. In the first **Address** field, specify the primary server. For example, `example.com`.
8. Since this origin has a higher load capacity, in the **Weight** field, add a weight of `3` to this first origin.
9. In the **Server Role** field, keep **Primary** selected.
10. Keep this address **Active**.
11. In the second **Address** field, specify the secondary server. In this case, `example.net`.
12. Due to its lower capacity, in the **Weight** field, add a weight of `2` to this address.
13. In the **Server Role** field, select **Primary**. This address has a lower weight value, so the preferred address for connections will be the first.
14. Keep this address **Active**.
15. Add a third origin by clicking the **+ Add Address** button.
16. In the **Address** field, specify the backup origin. In this case, `example.org`.
17. Keep the **Weight** field blank. It'll assume a default value of `1`.
18. In the **Server Role** field, select **Backup**.
19. Disable this address by turning off the **Active** switch.
20. Click the **Save** button.

To activate the Edge Connector in your edge application:

1. Access the **Rules Engine** tab.
2. Edit the default rule or add a new request rule.
3. In the **Criteria** section, to apply the Edge Connector for your whole application, set the **criteria** to `If ${uri} starts with /`.
4. In the **Behavior** section, select the Set Edge Connector behavior.
5. Select the Edge Connector you want to apply.
6. Click the **Save** button.
7. Wait some time for the changes to propagate to the edge. Then, access your application or use the command line to make a request and check if the changes were made.

First, to enable the **Load Balancer** module:

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Edge Application**.
2. Click the edge application for which you want to configure a new origin with load balancer.
3. On the **Main Settings** tab, under **Modules**, activate **Load Balancer**.
4. Click the **Save** button.

:::caution[warning]
In this section, you'll modify your default origin, which is of the Single Origin-type, into a Load Balancer-type origin. Editing your default origin will override the origin you configured when creating the edge application. To create a different origin, see [how to work with origins](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/work-with-origins/).
:::

To customize the origin according to the scenario described above:

1. Select the **Origins** tab.
2. In the **Origins** tab, click the **Default Origin** from the list.
3. Give your new origin a name.
4. Under **Type**, select **Load Balancer**.
5. In the **Method** field, select **Round-Robin**.
6. In the first **Address** field, specify the primary server. For example, example.com`.
7. Since this origin has a higher load capacity, in the **Weight** field, add a weight of `3` to this first origin.
8. In the **Server Role** field, keep **Primary** selected.
9. Keep this origin **Active**.
10. In the second **Address** field, specify the secondary server. In this case, `example.net`.
11. Due to its lower capacity, in the **Weight** field, add a weight of `2` to this origin.
12. In the **Server Role** field, select **Primary**. This origin has a lower weight value, the preferred origin for connections will be the first.
13. Keep this origin **Active**.
14. Add a third origin by clicking the **+ Add Origin** button.
15. In the **Address** field, specify the backup origin. In this case, `example.org`.
16. Keep the **Weight** field blank. It'll assume a default value of `1`.
17. In the **Server Role** field, select **Backup**.
18. Disable this origin by turning off the **Active** switch.
19. Click the **Save** button.

Wait a few minutes for the changes to propagate. Then, access your application or use the command line to make a request and check if the changes were made.

2. You should receive a response confirming the creation of your Edge Connector, then copy the ID field. This will be used in the following step.

3. Run the following `POST` request in your terminal to create a **Rules Engine** rule. This will bind your Edge Connector to your Edge Application, replacing the `<edge_application_id>` variable with the Edge Application ID and the `<edge_connector_id>`with the Edge Connector ID you copied previously: 

<Code lang="bash" code={`curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.azion.com/v4/edge_application/applications/<edge_application_id>/request_rules \

3. Copy the `<origin_key>` value.
