When you [create an edge application](/en/documentation/products/start-with-a-template/), you need to define an origin. However, more complex and robust infrastructures may need multiple origins for the same application. The [Load Balancer](/en-us/documentation/products/edge-application/load-balancer/) module allows you to use load balancing algorithms to manage high access numbers and control the behaviors of your origin.

:::caution[warning]
If **Load Balancer** is activated, data transfer could generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/) for more information.
:::

The following steps will walk you through a hypothetical scenario where the default origin should be of the Load Balancer-type with the [Round Robin algorithm](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/load-balancer/#balancing-method). Feel free to interpret and modify the step-by-step instructions according to your specific use case.

The following business rules of different origin servers must be configured with load balancing:

- The application should have three origins.
  - The primary server should have a higher load capacity.
  - The secondary server should have a medium load capacity, enough to handle large surges of incoming traffic.
  - The backup server should have a low load capacity and only be active in special circumstances.
- Each of these servers should be hosted in a different storage provider or cloud service since server outages don't often occur simultaneously.
- All origins must contain the same content and be set up in the exact same way for the edge application.

Therefore, the setup would be:

| Origin | Role | Address | Load capacity | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Primary server | `example.com` | High load capacity | Should always be active. |
| 2 | Secondary server | `example.net` | Medium load capacity | Should always be active. |
| 3 | Backup server | `example.org` | Low load capacity | Should only be active in case of maintenance or traffic surges. |

## Via RTM

First, to enable the **Load Balancer** module:

1. [Access RTM](https://manager.azion.com).
2. On the upper-left corner of the page, open the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, and then select **Edge Application**.
3. Click the edge application for which you want to configure a new origin with load balancer.
4. On the **Main Settings** tab, under **Modules**, activate **Load Balancer**.
5. Click the **Save** button.

:::caution[warning]
In this section, you'll modify your default origin, which is of the Single Origin-type, into a Load Balancer-type origin. Editing your default origin will override the origin you configured when creating the edge application. To create a different origin, see [how to work with origins](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/work-with-origins/).
:::

To customize the origin according to the scenario described above:

1. Select the **Origins** tab.
2. In the **Origins** tab, click the **Default Origin** from the list.
2. Give your new origin a name.
3. Under **Origin Type**, select **Load Balancer**.
4. In the **Method** field, select **Round Robin**.
5. In the first **Address** field, specify the primary server. For example, example.com`.
6. Since this origin has a higher load capacity, in the **Weight** field, add a weight of `3` to this first origin.
7. In the **Server Role** field, keep **Primary** selected.
8. Keep this origin **Active**.
9. Add another origin by clicking the **+** button.
10. In the second **Address** field, specify the secondary server. In this case, `example.net`.
11. Due to its lower capacity, in the **Weight** field, add a weight of `2` to this origin.
12. In the **Server Role** field, select **Primary**. This origin has a lower weight value, the preferred origin for connections will be the first.
14. Keep this origin **Active**.
15. Add a third origin by clicking the **+** button.
16. In the **Address** field, specify the backup origin. In this case, `example.org`.
17. Keep the **Weight** field blank. It will assume a default value of `1`.
18. In the **Server Role** field, select **Backup**.
19. Disable this origin by turning off the **Active** switch.
20. Click the **Save** button.

Wait a few minutes for the changes to propagate. Then, access your application or use the command line to make a request and check if the changes were made.

## Via API

1. Run the following `GET` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and `<edge_application_id>` variable with [your edge application ID](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/configure-main-settings/) to retrieve your default origin's `<origin_key>`, which is a UUID value:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_applications/<edge_application_id> \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]'
```

2. You'll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
    "results": {
        "origin_id": <origin_id>,
        "origin_key": "<origin_key>",
        "name": "Default Origin",
        "origin_type": "single_origin",
        ...
    }
}
```

3. Copy the `<origin_key>` value.
4. Run the following `PATCH` request to modify the default origin as follows, replacing the key and application id in the URL:

```bash
curl --location --request PATCH 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_applications/<edge_application_id>/origins/<origin_key>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--data '{
    "name": "Default Origin (RR3)",
    "origin_type": "load_balancer",
    "addresses": [
        {
            "address": "example.com",
            "weight": 3,
            "server_role": "primary",
            "is_active": true
        },
        {
            "address": "example.net",
            "weight": 2,
            "server_role": "primary",
            "is_active": true
        },
        {
            "address": "example.org",
            "weight": 1,
            "server_role": "backup",
            "is_active": false
        }
    ],
    "host_header": "${host}",
    "method": "round_robin"
}'
```

5. You'll receive a response similar to this, confirming the changes have been made:

```json
{
    "results": {
        "origin_id": <origin_id>,
        "origin_key": "<origin_key>",
        "name": "Default Origin (RR3)",
        "origin_type": "load_balancer",
        "addresses": [
            {
                "address": "example.com",
                "weight": 3,
                "server_role": "primary",
                "is_active": true
            },
            {
                "address": "example.net",
                "weight": 2,
                "server_role": "primary",
                "is_active": true
            },
            {
                "address": "example.org",
                "weight": 1,
                "server_role": "primary",
                "is_active": false
            }
        ]
        "host_header": "${host}",
        "method": "round_robin"
        ...
    }
}
```

6. Wait a few minutes for the propagation to occur.
