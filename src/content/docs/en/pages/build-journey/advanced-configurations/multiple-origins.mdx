Azion Edge Application requires at least one origin. However, more complex and robust infrastructures might need multiple origin configurations for the same application. The **Load Balancer** module allows you to use load balancing algorithms to manage high access numbers and control your origin behaviors.

By distributing network traffic efficiently across several servers, these algorithms ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed, thereby preventing potential system crashes. Furthermore, they enable smoother user experiences by reducing load times and ensuring efficient use of resources.

:::caution[warning]
If **Load Balancer** is activated, data transfer could generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/) for more information.

## Scenario

The following steps will walk you through a hypothetical scenario where the default origin should be of the Load Balancer-type with the [Round Robin algorithm](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/load-balancer/#balancing-method). Feel free to interpret and modify the step-by-step instructions according to your specific use case.

In this scenario, the following business rules of different origin servers must be configured with load balancing:

- The application should have three origins.
  - The primary server should have a higher load capacity.
  - The secondary server should have a medium load capacity, enough to handle large surges of incoming traffic.
  - The backup server should have a low load capacity and only be active in special circumstances.
- Each of these servers should be hosted in a different storage provider or cloud service since server outages don't often occur simultaneously.
- All origins must contain the same content and be set up in the exact same way for the edge application.

Therefore, the setup should look like this:

| Origin | Role | Address | Load capacity | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Primary server | `example.com` | High load capacity | Should always be active. |
| 2 | Secondary server | `example.net` | Medium load capacity | Should always be active. |
| 3 | Backup server | `example.org` | Low load capacity | Should only be active in case of maintenance or traffic surges. |

## Via RTM

First, to enable **Load Balancer** through RTM:

1. [Access RTM](https://manager.azion.com).
2. On the upper-left corner of the page, open the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, and then select **Edge Application**.
3. Click the edge application for which you want to configure a new origin with load balancer.
4. On the **Main Settings** tab, under **Modules**, activate **Load Balancer**.
5. Click the **Save** button.

:::caution[warning]
In this section, you'll modify your default origin, which is of the Single Origin-type, into a Load Balancer-type origin. Editing your default origin will override the origin you configured when creating the edge application. To create a different origin, see [Work with origins](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/work-with-origins/).
:::

Now, to customize the origin according to the [scenario](#scenario) described above:

1. Select the **Origins** tab.
2. In the **Origins** tab, click the **Default Origin** from the list.
2. Give your new origin a name.
3. Under **Origin Type**, select **Load Balancer**.
4. In the **Method** field, select **Round Robin**.
5. In the first **Address** field, specify the primary server. For example, example.com`.
6. Since this origin has a higher load capacity, in the **Weight** field, add a weight of `3` to this first origin.
7. In the **Server Role** field, keep **Primary** selected.
8. Keep this origin **Active**.
9. Add another origin by clicking the **+** button.
10. In the second **Address** field, specify the secondary server. In this case, `example.net`.
11. Due to its lower capacity, in the **Weight** field, add a weight of `2` to this origin.
12. In the **Server Role** field, select **Primary**. This origin has a lower weight value, the preferred origin for connections will be the first.
14. Keep this origin **Active**.
15. Add a third origin by clicking the **+** button.
16. In the **Address** field, specify the backup origin. In this case, `example.org`.
17. Keep the **Weight** field blank. It will assume a default value of `1`.
18. In the **Server Role** field, select **Backup**.
19. Disable this origin by turning off the **Active** switch.
20. Click the **Save** button.

Wait a few minutes for the changes to propagate. Then, access your application or use the command line to make a request and check if the changes were made.

## Via API

1. Run the following `GET` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and `<edge_application_id>` variable with [your edge application ID](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/configure-main-settings/) to retrieve your default origin's `<origin_key>`, which is a UUID value:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_applications/<edge_application_id> \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]'
```

2. You'll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
    "results": {
        "origin_id": <origin_id>,
        "origin_key": "<origin_key>",
        "name": "Default Origin",
        "origin_type": "single_origin",
        ...
    }
}
```

3. Copy the `<origin_key>` value.
4. Run the following `PATCH` request to modify the default origin as follows, replacing the key and application id in the URL:

```bash
curl --location --request PATCH 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_applications/<edge_application_id>/origins/<origin_key>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--data '{
    "name": "Default Origin (RR3)",
    "origin_type": "load_balancer",
    "addresses": [
        {
            "address": "example.com",
            "weight": 3,
            "server_role": "primary",
            "is_active": true
        },
        {
            "address": "example.net",
            "weight": 2,
            "server_role": "primary",
            "is_active": true
        },
        {
            "address": "example.org",
            "weight": 1,
            "server_role": "backup",
            "is_active": false
        }
    ],
    "host_header": "${host}",
    "method": "round_robin"
}'
```

5. You'll receive a response similar to this, confirming the changes have been made:

```json
{
    "results": {
        "origin_id": <origin_id>,
        "origin_key": "<origin_key>",
        "name": "Default Origin (RR3)",
        "origin_type": "load_balancer",
        "addresses": [
            {
                "address": "example.com",
                "weight": 3,
                "server_role": "primary",
                "is_active": true
            },
            {
                "address": "example.net",
                "weight": 2,
                "server_role": "primary",
                "is_active": true
            },
            {
                "address": "example.org",
                "weight": 1,
                "server_role": "primary",
                "is_active": false
            }
        ]
        "host_header": "${host}",
        "method": "round_robin"
        ...
    }
}
```

6. Wait a few minutes for the propagation to occur.
