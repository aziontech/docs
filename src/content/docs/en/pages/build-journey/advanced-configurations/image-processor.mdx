title: How to optimize image processing at the edge
description: Manage image sizes, filters, watermarks, formats, and process images directly at the edge using a single URL query with Image Processor.

Through the [Image Processor](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/image-processor/) module, you can adjust image sizes, add filters and watermarks, or convert formats to suit for more efficient content delivery, bandwidth saving, and reduce object storage costs. These changes can be applied directly in the URL of your image by appending `ims` queries to the image's URL.

:::caution[warning]
If you wish to optimize your images, in addition to the **Image Processor module, the activation of the [Application Acceleration](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/application-acceleration/) module is recommended for cache efficiency. If these modules are activated, images processed and data transfer could generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/) for more information.

## Via RTM

1. [Access RTM](https://manager.azion.com).
2. On the upper-left corner of the page, open the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, and select **Edge Application**.
3. Click the edge application you want to configure. 
4. Activate the **Application Acceleration** and **Image Processor** modules.
5. Navigate to the **Cache Settings** tab.
6. Click the **Add Cache Settings** button.
7. In the **Expiration Settings** section, configure the [expiration policy](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/cache-settings/#browser-cache-settings) for your images.
- For images, you may add larger time-to-live (TTL) values, such as `1296000` seconds (15 days).
8. In the **Advanced Cache Key** section, choose one of the following options:

    - **Content varies by some Query String fields (Whitelist)**: if you want to list all the fields in the Query String that will identify your images. **Image Processor** uses the *ims* field, so this has to be included in the list as one of the required fields for your image manager application.
    - **Content varies by Query String, except for some fields (Blacklist)**: if you only want to list those fields in the Query String that should be ignored to identify the objects in your cache. In this case, it guarantees that the *ims* field will be removed from the list.
    - **Content varies by all Query String fields**: if you don't know or aren't sure about which fields to list in the Query String because you aren't responsible for all the content in the cache or don't have [Application Acceleration](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/application-acceleration/) activated.

9. Click the **Save** button.

Now you need to indicate what will trigger the activation of the **Image Processor** module. You can create a rule that identifies image formats as follows:

1. Still on the *Edge Application** page, navigate to the **Rules Engine** tab.
2. Click the **Add Rule** button and select **Request Phase**.
3. Name your rule.
4. In the **Criteria** section, select the variable `${request_uri}`.
5. Select the comparsion operator **matches**
6. As an argument, add `\.(jpg|jpeg|gif|bmp|png)`.
7. Click **Or** to add another criterium.
8. In the new field, select the variable `${uri}`.
9. Select the comparsion operator **matches**
10. As an argument, add `\.(jpg|jpeg|gif|bmp|png)$`
11. In the **Behavior** section, select **Set Cache Policy** and select the cache setting you created.
12. Click the **+** button.
13. Add the **Optimize Images** behavior.

:::note[Optional]
To ensure images are successfully converted to WEBP format, you must also add the behavior **Add Request Header** and send the header `Accept: image/webp`.
:::

12. Click the **Save** button to save your rule.

To confirm whether your image is being optimized, [inspect the page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools) using your browser and find the corresponding path in the image. In the URL's query string, the `ims=VALUExVALUE` field corresponds to the resolution loaded on the page. To see the original file, you only need to remove the query string added in the URL.

## Via API

1. Run the following `PATCH` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and the `<edge_application_id>` variable with [your edge application ID](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/configure-main-settings/) to activate the [Application Acceleration](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/application-acceleration/) and [Image Processor](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/image-processor/) modules:

```bash
curl --location --request PATCH 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_applications/<edge_application_id>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--data '{
    "application_acceleration": true,
    "image_optimization": true
}'
```

2. You'll receive a response with the updated value.
3. Run the following `POST` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and the `<edge_application_id>` variable with the `id` of your edge application:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_applications/<edge_application_id>/cache_settings' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--data '{
    "name": "QS15D img",
    "browser_cache_settings": "override",
    "browser_cache_settings_maximum_ttl": 60,
    "cdn_cache_settings": "override",
    "cdn_cache_settings_maximum_ttl": 1296000,
    "cache_by_query_string": "whitelist",
    "query_string_fields": [
        "ims"
    ]
}'
```

:::note

4. You'll receive a response similar to this:

```json

    "results": {
        "id": <cache_setting_id>,
        "name": "QS15D img",
        "browser_cache_settings": "override",

5. Copy the cache setting ID received in the response.
6. Run the following `POST` request to create a rule in the **Request Phase**, replacing the edge application ID value and the cache setting ID you received in the previous response:

```bash
curl --location --globoff 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_applications/<edge_application_id>/rules_engine/request/rules' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
