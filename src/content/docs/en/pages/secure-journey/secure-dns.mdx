**Intelligent DNS** allows you to host your domains directly on Azion Edge Platform. By doing so, they'll be secured with and by the same policies used on Azion's distributed infrastructure.

Intelligent DNS works as an authoritative DNS server that hosts zones, records, and configurations.

## Step 1. Add a domain

To begin hosting a domain with Intelligent DNS, you need to provide a name and the FQDN recorded. You're also able to add a list of nameservers.

## Step 2. Manage records

You need to specify the type of record now being used with Intelligent DNS and configure further settings such as response value, Time-to-live (TTL) value, and desired policy.

## Migrate a domain to Azion

If you already have a domain hosted in another provider, you can migrate it to Azion with Intelligent DNS and associate it with edge applications and edge firewalls to guarantee your business is protected.
