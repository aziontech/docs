**Edge DNS** allows you to host your domains directly on Azion Web Platform. By doing so, they'll be secured with and by the same policies used on Azion's distributed infrastructure.

Edge DNS works as an authoritative DNS server that hosts zones, records, and configurations.

## Step 1. Add a domain

To begin hosting a domain with Edge DNS, you need to provide a name and the FQDN recorded. You're also able to add a list of nameservers.

## Step 2. Manage records

You need to specify the type of record now being used with Edge DNS and configure further settings such as response value, Time-to-live (TTL) value, and desired policy.

## Migrate a domain to Azion

If you already have a domain hosted in another provider, you can migrate it to Azion with Edge DNS and associate it with applications and firewalls to guarantee your business is protected.
