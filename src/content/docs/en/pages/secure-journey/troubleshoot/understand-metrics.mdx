Once you create an edge firewall and [activate the Web Application Firewall (WAF) module](/en/documentation/products/guides/secure/configure-main-settings/#modules), you can also use [Observe](/en/documentation/products/observe/) products to monitor how WAF is processing requests made to your applications.

- [Real-Time Metrics](/en/documentation/products/real-time-metrics/): access to charts with aggregated data to explore behaviors throughout longer periods of data storage.
- [GraphQL API](/en/documentation/products/graphql-api-overview/): access to aggragated and raw data via API with customized queries with only the data you request.
- [Real-Time Events](/en/documentation/products/real-time-events/): access to logs with raw data to perform extensive analysis.
