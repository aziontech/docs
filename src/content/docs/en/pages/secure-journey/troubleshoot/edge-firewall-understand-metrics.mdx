Once you create an edge firewall and [activate the Web Application Firewall (WAF) module](/en/documentation/products/guides/secure/edge-firewall-configure-main-settings/#modules), you can also use [Observe](/en/documentation/products/observe/) products to monitor how WAF is processing requests made to your applications.

- [Real-Time Metrics](/en/documentation/products/observe/real-time-metrics/): access to charts with aggregated data to explore behaviors throughout longer periods of data storage.
- [GraphQL API](/en/documentation/devtools/graphql-api/overview/): access to aggragated and raw data via API with customized queries with only the data you request.
- [Real-Time Events](/en/documentation/products/observe/real-time-events/): access to logs with raw data to perform extensive analysis.

## WAF

To monitor how WAF processes requests and threats:

<LinkButton link="/en/documentation/products/observe/real-time-metrics/#waf" label="view aggregated metrics" outlined /> <br></br>

<LinkButton link="/en/documentation/devtools/graphql-api/features/#datasets" label="query data" outlined /> <br></br>

<LinkButton link="/en/documentation/products/observe/real-time-events/#waf-events" label="view raw data" outlined /><br />

:::note
The `Set WAF [Your WAF]` Edge Firewall behavior performs special processing, allowing other rules to be processed simultaneously. As a result, logs may display other rules in the `traceback` field, even if the WAF Rule Set is configured to block and return the request.  However, the WAF rules operate correctly, blocking requests that match the specified criteria. This behavior is standard for the platform.
