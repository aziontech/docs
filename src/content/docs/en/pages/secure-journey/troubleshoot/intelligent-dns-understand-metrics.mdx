import Button from 'azion-webkit/components/Button';

Once you host your domains and create zones on [Edge DNS](/en/documentation/products/guides/secure/edge-dns-configure-main-settings/), you can also rely on [Observe](/en/documentation/products/observe/) products to monitor how WAF is processing requests made to your applications.

- [Real-Time Metrics](/en/documentation/products/observe/real-time-metrics/): access to charts with aggregated data to explore behaviors throughout longer periods of data storage.
- [GraphQL API](/en/documentation/devtools/graphql-api/overview/): access to aggregated and raw data via API with customized queries with only the requested data.
