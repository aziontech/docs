Once you've set up your [Edge DNS zone](/en/documentation/products/guides/secure/edge-dns-configure-main-settings/), you can test it to see if it's properly processing your information.

## Using the DIG command

**Domain Information Groper (DIG)** is a network administration command-line tool. It's useful for network troubleshooting and for educational purposes. When a specific nameserver isn't specified in the command invocation, it uses the operating system's default resolver, usually configured in the file `resolv.conf`. Without any arguments, it queries the DNS root zone.

To test **Edge DNS**, you must use one of the [Azion nameservers](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-dns/#dns-provider-configuration) that you've configured in your DNS registry.

## Using the HOST command

**Host** queries the DNS, converting domain names into IP addresses and vice-versa. If no argument or option is provided, the host prints a brief summary of the command line options and arguments.

For example, if you have the following settings:

| Name | Type | Value                                               | TTL  |
|------|------|-----------------------------------------------------|------|
| www  | A    | 192.168.0.1<br /><br /> 192.168.0.2<br /><br /> 192.168.0.3 | 3600 |

To check how Edge DNS handles a type A query, registered to the `www` record, run:

```bash
host www.example.com ns1.aziondns.net
```

The response to this will be:

```bash
Using domain server: Name: ns1.aziondns.net Address: 179.191.160.2#53 Aliases: www.example.com has address 192.168.0.1 www.example.com has address 192.168.0.2 www.example.com has address 192.168.0.3
```

## Using the NSLOOKUP command

**nslookup** is a tool used to obtain information about DNS records for a particular domain, host, or IP.

For example, if you have the following settings:

| Name | Type | Value                                               | TTL  |
|------|------|-----------------------------------------------------|------|
| www  | A    | 192.168.0.1<br /><br /> 192.168.0.2<br /><br /> 192.168.0.3 | 3600 |

To check how Edge DNS handles a type A query, registered to the `www` record, run the following command:

```bash
nslookup www.example.com ns1.aziondns.net
```

The response to this will be:

```bash
Server: ns1.aziondns.net Address: 179.191.160.2#53 Name: www.example.com Address: 192.168.0.1 Name: www.example.com Address: 192.168.0.2 Name: www.example.com Address: 192.168.0.3
```
