:::caution[important]
Azion has two user interfaces: Real-Time Manager and Console, which is in *Preview* stage. Currently, Console is only available for Developer plans and new accounts. Follow the steps according to the user interface you're using.
:::

Once you've [created an edge firewall and secured your application](/en/documentation/products/secure/secure-application/), you can use **Origin Shield** to secure your infrastructure by blocking threats.

Origin Shield works as a list of IP/CIDR addresses used in Azion's Edge, thus providing assurance of safe IPs to allow access. The list is maintained by Azion and available via Azion Console and API, but each client must create automation to guarantee their security policies are always up-to-date with the Origin Shield addresses.

---

## Step 1. Enable Origin Shield

To access the Origin Shield list, you must have:

- An [edge firewall created](/en/documentation/products/secure/secure-application/).
- The [Network Layer Protection module](/en/documentation/products/guides/secure/edge-firewall-configure-main-settings/#modules) enabled.
- Be subscribed to the Origin Shield add-on. Contact the [sales team](https://www.azion.com/en/contact-sales/) to subscribe to this feature.

## Step 2. Access the list of addresses

<Tabs client:visible>
    <Fragment slot="tab.console">Console</Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.rtm">Real-Time Manager</Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.api">API</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.console">
1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/) > select **Network Lists**.
2. Select **Azion Origin Shield**.
3. On the **List** field, you can copy the IP addresses list.
</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.rtm">
1. Access [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/) > select **Network Lists**.
2. Select **Azion Origin Shield**.
3. On the **List** field, you can copy the IP addresses list.
</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.api">

1. Run the following `GET` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/)

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/network_lists' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]'
```

2. You'll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
  "count": 4,
  "total_pages": 1,
  "schema_version": 3,
  "links": {
    "previous": null,
    "next": null
  },
  "results": [
    {
      "id": 2345,
      "last_editor": "last.editor@azion.com",
      "last_modified": "2023-03-27T21:19:27.996870Z",
      "list_type": "ip_cidr",
      "name": "Azion Origin Shield",
      "country_list": [],
      "ip_list": [
        "192.168.0.5"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

3. On the `ip_list` field, you'll receive all IPs added by Azion. You can copy the IP addresses list.

</Fragment>

</Tabs>

:::note
Clients with Origin Shield receive an email every time the list is updated and have *7 days* to update automations, when necessary, to retrieve the new list.
:::

---

## Step 3. Automate new address additions

After having access and checking the list of IP addresses provided by Origin Shield, you can create an automation with Rules Engine, ensuring your infrastructure is always protected with the most recent version of safe IPs.
