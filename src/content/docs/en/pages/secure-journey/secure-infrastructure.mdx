Once you've [created an edge firewall and secured your application](/en/documentation/products/secure/secure-application/), you can use **Origin Shield** to secure your infrastructure by blocking threats.

Origin Shield works as a list of IP/CIDR addresses used in Azion's Edge, thus providing assurance of safe IPs to allow access. The list is maintained by Azion and available via Real-Time Manager (RTM) and API, but each client must create automation to guarantee their security policies are always up-to-date with the Origin Shield addresses.

---

## Step 1. Enable Origin Shield

To access the Origin Shield list, you must have:

- An [edge firewall created](/en/documentation/products/secure/secure-application/).
- The [Network Layer Protection module](/en/documentation/products/guides/secure/configure-main-settings/#modules) enabled.

---

## Step 2. Access the list of addresses

### Via RTM

1. [Access RTM](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/) > select **Network Lists**.
2. Select **Azion IP Tor Exit Nodes**.
3. On the **List** field, you can copy the IP addresses list.

:::note
Clients with Origin Shield receive an email every time the list is updated.

### Via API

1. Run the following `GET` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/)

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/network_lists' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]'
```

2. You'll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
  "count": 4,
  "total_pages": 1,
  "schema_version": 3,
  "links": {
    "previous": null,
    "next": null
  },
  "results": [
    {
      "id": 2345,
      "last_editor": "last.editor@azion.com",
      "last_modified": "2023-03-27T21:19:27.996870Z",
      "list_type": "ip_cidr",
      "name": "Azion IP Tor Exit Nodes",
      "country_list": [],
      "ip_list": [
        "192.168.0.5"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

3. On the `ip_list` field, you'll receive all IPs added by Azion. You can copy the IP addresses list.

---

## Step 3. Automate new address additions

After having access and checking the list of IP addresses provided by Origin Shield, you can create an automation for usage of each update made to the list, ensuring your infrastructure is always protected with the most recent version of safe IPs.
