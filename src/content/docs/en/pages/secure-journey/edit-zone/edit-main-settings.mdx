Azion has two user interfaces: Real-Time Manager and Console, which is in *Preview* stage. Currently, Console is only available for Developer plans and new accounts. Follow the steps according to the user interface you're using.

In this guide, you'll learn to create an [Edge DNS](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-dns/) zone with its main settings and edit them after you create the zone.

In this section, you'll create or edit the main settings of **Edge DNS** with a domain via [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com).

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Edge DNS**.
2. To create a new zone, click the **+ Zone** button. To edit an existing zone, select the zone you want to edit from the list.

### Creating a new zone

1. Give your zone a unique and easy-to-remember name.
2. In **Domain Name**, add the name of the domain you want to host in Edge DNS. For example: `mydomain.com`.
3. Click the **Save** button.

### Editing an existing zone

1. Optionally, edit the name of your zone.
2. In **Domain Name**, edit the name of the domain you want to host in Edge DNS.
3. Click the **Save** button.

Once you're done configuring your main settings, you can add records to your Edge DNS.

:::caution[warning]
Once you host your domain on Azion Edge DNS, you must change your domain's authoritative DNS servers to use Azion's nameservers:

- ns1.aziondns.net
- ns2.aziondns.com
- ns3.aziondns.org

1. Run the following `POST` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) to create a new zone:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/intelligent_dns' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "name": "New zone",
    "domain": "yourdomain.com",
    "is_active": true
}'
```

2. You'll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "nx_ttl": 3600,
      "domain": "yourdomain.com",
      "retry": 7200,
      "name": "New zone",
      "nameservers": [
        "ns1.aziondns.net",
        "ns2.aziondns.com",
        "ns3.aziondns.org"
      ],
      "soa_ttl": 3600,
      "is_active": true,
      "refresh": 43200,
      "expiry": 1209600,
      "id": 1234
    }
  ],
  "schema_version": 3
}
```

Wait a few minutes for the changes to propagate and your zone will be created.
