[Edge Firewall](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/) allows you to secure your [edge applications](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/build-an-application/) and [domains](/en/documentation/products/guides/configure-a-domain/) against several types of threats and attacks.

Azion provides a range of tools to configure your edge firewall:

- [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/): provides a user-friendly interface to configure your edge firewall and rule sets.
- [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/#00268e07-463f-4de1-9b45-ceeab187bf19): allows you to create, configure, and automate edge firewalls and its related modules and features.
- [Azion SDK](): allows you to improve the development of your Go application.
- [Terraform](/en/documentation/products/secure/automate/terraform/): provides integration for your infrastructure with Azion using Terraform.
- [Edge Runtime](): leverages APIs for networking and data handling.
