You can use the [WAF Tuning](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/web-application-firewall/#waf-tuning) feature to analyze network lists, IPs, and countries that have matched configured WAF rule sets.

In this guide, you'll filter possible attacks in your WAF and create an allowed rule from the results you receive.

First, you need to have an [edge firewall configure]() and [activate WAF in the firewall](/en/documentation/products/guides/secure/configure-main-settings/#modules) you want to use.

After setting up the initial configurations, proceed as follows:

1. [Access RTM](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/) > select **WAF Rules**.
2. Select the **Tuning** tab.
    - Under the **Filter Possible Attacks** section, you'll find the available variables to filter.
3. In the **Domain(s)** dropdown, select the domains you want to analyze. Mandatory field.
4. Optionally, you can choose to filter by:
    - Time range
    - Network List
    - IP Address
    - Country
5. Click the **Apply filter** button.

To exemplify a real-life situation, let's assume the existence and analysis of few variables:

1. On **Domain(s)**, select `www.mydomain.com` and `www.anotherdomain.com`.
2. On **Time Range**, select **Last 12 hours**.
3. On **Network List**, select **Blocklist IPs**.
4. Click **Apply filter**.

You'll receive a list of records regarding the filters you've applied. You can do a drilldown of the records by clicking on each of them.
