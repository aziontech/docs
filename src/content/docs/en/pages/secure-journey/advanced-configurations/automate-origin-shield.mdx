**Origin Shield** provides the list of Azion Edge Nodes' IP addresses.

<Button href="/en/documentation/products/secure/secure-infrastructure/" text="go to secure an infrastructure" variant="secondary"></Button>

By activating Origin Shield, your application's is protected from a network list maintained by Azion. The IP addresses in it change from time to time, but you can automate a behavior using Rules Engine to guarantee you're always using the updated list.

---

## Via RTM

To create a rule:

1. [On RTM](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/), navigate to **Edge Firewall**.
2. Select the edge firewall in which you want to configure the rule.
3. Click the **Rules Engine** tab.
4. Click the **New Rule** button.
5. Give your rule a name and, optionally, a description.
6. As a comparison operator, select **does not match**.
7. As an argument, select the `Azion Origin Shield` list.
8. In the **Behaviors** section, select **Drop (Close Without Response)** from the behavior list.
9. Click the **Save** button.

If your application receives a request generated from an IP that isn't in the list, the edge firewall will drop the request.

## Via API

1. Run the following `GET` request to retrieve the `id` of the **Azion Origin Shield** list:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/network_lists' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]'
```

2. You'll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
  "count": 1,
  "total_pages": 1,
  "schema_version": 3,
  "links": {
    "previous": null,
    "next": null
  },
  "results": [
    {
      "id": 6217,
      "last_editor": "user@email.com",
      "last_modified": "2023-11-14T21:35:39.808175Z",
      "list_type": "ip_cidr",
      "name": "Azion Origin Shield",
      "country_list": [],
      "ip_list": [
        "192.168.0.5"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
}
```

3. Run the following `POST` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/), the `<edge_firewall_id>` variable with your [edge firewall ID](https://api.azion.com/#58376993-e0dd-4b51-9cd3-41d86122728f), and the `<network_list_id>` value with the Origin Shield list ID:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_firewall/<edge_firewall_id>/rules_engine' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "name": "Automate Origin Shield",
    "is_active": true,
    "behaviors": [
        {
            "name": "drop"
        }
    ],
    "criteria": [
        [
            {
                "variable": "network",
                "operator": "is_not_in_list",
                "conditional": "if",
                "argument": "<network_list_id>"
            }
        ]
    ]
}'
```

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | Name of the rule |
| `behaviors` | Array that stores objects that define behaviors |
| `criteria` | Array that stores objects that define criteria |

See the [Azion API documentation](https://api.azion.com/#ff2b221b-0054-407f-aad3-39cda3a9ed0f) to find out more about criteria and behavior objects.

4. You'll receive the following response:

```json
{
  "results": {
    "name": "Automate Origin Shield",
    "is_active": true,
    "behaviors": [
      {
        "name": "drop"
      }
    ],
    "criteria": [
      [
        {
          "variable": "network",
          "operator": "is_not_in_list",
          "conditional": "if",
          "argument": "6217"
        }
      ]
    ],
    "last_modified": "2023-11-29T19:53:56.476161Z",
    "last_editor": "user@email.com",
    "id": 28629,
    "order": 3
  },
  "schema_version": 3
}
```

5. Wait a few minutes for the changes to propagate.

If your application receives a request generated from an IP that isn't in the list, the edge firewall will drop the request.
