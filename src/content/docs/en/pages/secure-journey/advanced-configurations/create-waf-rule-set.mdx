[Web Application Firewall (WAF)](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/web-application-firewall/) allows you to create rule sets regarding possible [threat types](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/web-application-firewall/#waf-main-settings). You can set these rule sets on Rules Engine for Edge Firewall to execute their behaviors.

This guide will create a rule set to block threats from the **SQL Injection** family to prevent attacks that attempt a `select` query, for example. After [creating an edge firewall](/en/documentation/products/guides/secure/configure-main-settings/) and [activating the WAF module](/en/documentation/products/guides/secure/configure-main-settings/#modules), follow the steps described next.

---

## Via RTM

1. [Access RTM](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/) > **WAF Rules**.
2. Click the **Add WAF** button.
3. On the **Main Settings** tab, give your WAF rule set a unique and easy-to-remember name. In this case, `SQL Injection rule set`.
4. On the **Threat Type Configuration** section, look for the **SQL Injection** option.
5. Choose the **Sensitivity** option **High** for this threat so WAF doesn't allow requests considered as an SQL Injection threat.
6. Make sure the **Active** switch is enabled.
7. Click the **Save** button.

Repeat this process with other types of threats to which you want to create a rule set.

Now, you need to apply the rule set you've created in **Rules Engine**. To do so:

1. Still on RTM, go to **Edge Firewall**.
2. Select the **Rules Engine** tab.
3. Click the **New Rule** button.
4. Give your rule a name and, optionally, a description.
5. In the **Criteria** section, select the `Request Args` variable.
6. As a comparison operator, select `matches`.
7. As an argument, add `content-type=select`.
8. In the **Behaviors** section, select **Set WAF Rule Set**.
9. As arguments:
    - On the first dropdown menu, select the rule set you want to use. In this case, `SQL Injection rule set`.
    - On the second dropdown menu, select the mode you want Edge Firewall to operate on: **Learning** or **Blocking**. In this case, **Blocking**.
10. Click the **Save** button.

## Via API

1. Run the following `POST` request to create a rule, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/):

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/waf/rulesets' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "name": "SQL Injection rule set",
    "mode": "blocking",
    "active": true,
    "sql_injection": true,
    "sql_injection_sensitivity": "high",
    "bypass_addresses": []
}'
```

2. You'll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
  "id": 6421,
  "name": "SQL Injection rule set",
  "mode": "counting",
  "active": true,
  "sql_injection": true,
  "sql_injection_sensitivity": "high",
  "remote_file_inclusion": true,
  "remote_file_inclusion_sensitivity": "medium",
  "directory_traversal": true,
  "directory_traversal_sensitivity": "medium",
  "cross_site_scripting": true,
  "cross_site_scripting_sensitivity": "medium",
  "evading_tricks": true,
  "evading_tricks_sensitivity": "medium",
  "file_upload": true,
  "file_upload_sensitivity": "medium",
  "unwanted_access": true,
  "unwanted_access_sensitivity": "medium",
  "identified_attack": true,
  "identified_attack_sensitivity": "medium",
  "bypass_addresses": []
}
```

3. Copy the `id` value.
4. Run the following `POST` request to create a rule, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/), the `<edge_firewall_id>` variable with your [edge firewall id](https://api.azion.com/#58376993-e0dd-4b51-9cd3-41d86122728f) value, and `<waf_rule_set_id>` with the id you copied:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_firewall/<edge_firewall_id>/rules_engine' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token azion5c2ecd92839e59b0cca662ada47b7382706' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "name": "SQL Injection rule",
    "is_active": true,
    "behaviors": [
        {
            "name": "set_waf_ruleset",
            "argument": "<waf_rule_set_id>"
        }
    ],
    "criteria": [
        [
            {
                "variable": "request_args",
                "operator": "matches",
                "conditional": "if",
                "argument": "content-type=select"
            }
        ]
    ]
}'
```

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | Name of the rule |
| `behaviors` | Array that stores objects defining behaviors |
| `criteria` | Array that stores objects defining criteria |

See the [Azion API documentation](https://api.azion.com/#ff2b221b-0054-407f-aad3-39cda3a9ed0f) to find out more about criteria and behavior objects.

5. You'll receive the following response:

```json
{
  "results": {
    "name": "SQL Injection rule",
    "is_active": true,
    "behaviors": [
      {
        "name": "set_waf_ruleset",
        "argument": "6421"
      }
    ],
    "criteria": [
      [
        {
          "variable": "request_args",
          "operator": "matches",
          "conditional": "if",
          "argument": "content-type=select"
        }
      ]
    ],

    "last_editor": "user@email.com",
    "id": 28735,
    "order": 4
  },
  "schema_version": 3
}
```

Wait a few minutes for the changes to propagate.
