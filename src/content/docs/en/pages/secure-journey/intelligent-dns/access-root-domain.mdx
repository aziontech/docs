You can configure your Intelligent DNS to allow access to it through its root domain, which is also called naked domain, representing the simplest form a domain name can have. This configuration occurs by creating an **ANAME record type**.

<Button href="/en/documentation/products/guides/secure/add-records/" text="go to add records guide" variant="secondary"></Button>

For this guide, assume you're configuring a record for a zone with the `domain.com` domain name.

## Via API

1. Run the following `GET` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) to retrieve your `<hosted_zone_id>`:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/intelligent_dns' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3'
```

2. You'll receive a response with all your existing edge firewalls. Copy the value of the `<id>` that you want to use.
3. Run the following `POST` request, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and the `<hosted_zone_id>` value you copied:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/intelligent_dns/<hosted_zone_id>/records' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--data-raw '{
    "record_type": "ANAME",
    "entry": "www",
    "answers_list": [
        "www.mydomain.com"
    ],
    "description": "description"
}'
```

4. You'll receive a response similar to this:

```json

```

Wait a few minutes for the changes to propagate and your records will be created in the hosted zone you chose.
