In this guide, you'll learn to create an [intelligent DNS](/en/documentation/products/intelligent-dns/) zone with its main settings and edit them after you create the zone.

---

## Via RTM

In this section, you'll create or edit the main settings of **Intelligent DNS** with a domain via [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com).

1. [Access RTM](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/) > **Intelligent DNS**.
2. To create a new zone, click the **Add Zone** button. To edit an existing zone, select the intelligent DNS you want to edit from the list.

:::caution[warning]
Once you host your domain on Azion Intelligent DNS, you must change your domain's authoritative DNS servers to use Azion's nameservers:

- ns1.aziondns.net
- ns2.aziondns.com
- ns3.aziondns.org
:::

### Creating a new zone

1. Give your intelligent DNS a unique and easy-to-remember name.
2. In **Domain**, add the name of the domain you want to host in Intelligent DNS. For example: `mydomain`.
3. Click the **Save** button.

### Editing an existing zone

1. Optionally, edit the name of your intelligent DNS.
2. In **Domain Name**, edit the name of the domain you want to host in Intelligent DNS.
3. Click the **Save** button.

Once you're done configuring your main settings, you can add records to your intelligent DNS.

## Via API

1. Run the following `POST` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) to create a new intelligent DNS:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/intelligent_dns' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "name": "New zone",
    "domain": "yourdomain.com",
    "is_active": true
}'
```

2. You'll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "nx_ttl": 3600,
      "domain": "yourdomain.com",
      "retry": 7200,
      "name": "New zone",
      "nameservers": [
        "ns1.aziondns.net",
        "ns2.aziondns.com",
        "ns3.aziondns.org"
      ],
      "soa_ttl": 3600,
      "is_active": true,
      "refresh": 43200,
      "expiry": 1209600,
      "id": 1234
    }
  ],
  "schema_version": 3
}
```

:::caution[warning]
Once you host your domain on Azion Intelligent DNS, you must change your domain's authoritative DNS servers to use Azion's nameservers:

- ns1.aziondns.net
- ns2.aziondns.com
- ns3.aziondns.org
:::

Wait a few minutes for the changes to propagate and your intelligent DNS will be created.

:::tip
Check the [Azion API documentation](https://api.azion.com/) and the [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/aziontech/azionapi-openapi/) to know more about what the Azion API can offer.

Once you're done configuring your main settings, you can add records to your intelligent DNS.
