After defining your [intelligent DNS main settings](/en/documentation/products/guides/secure/intelligent-dns-configure-main-settings/), you can add records to specify which IPs are associated with the domain and how **Intelligent DNS** should handle requests for the domain.

---

## Via RTM

1. [Access RTM](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/) > **Intelligent DNS**.
2. From the list, choose the intelligent DNS in which you want to add records.
3. Select the **Records** tab.
4. Click the **Add Record** button.
5. In **Name**, provide the new record's name. Depending on the [type of record](/en/documentation/products/intelligent-dns/#type) you want to use, there may exist specific formats and recommendations. For example: for a CNAME record, you can use the name `www`.
6. In **Type**, select the type of record you want to add. Accepts the types `A`, `AAAA`, `ANAME`, `CAA`, `CNAME`, `DS`, `MX`, `NS`, `PTR`, `SRV`, and `TXT`.
7. In **Value**, add the items for the DNS response to the registered record. The accepted values vary according to the [chosen type of record](/en/documentation/products/intelligent-dns/#type).
8. In **TTl (seconds)**, choose the time, in seconds, a response can be cached for on a resolver server. Maximum value: `2147483647`.
9. In **Policy**, select between **Simple** or **Weighted**.
10. If you select **Weighted** in **Policy**:
    - In **Weight**, specify the weight for each record. Accepts values from `0` to `255`.
    - In **Description** (optional), you can describe, for example, the distinction between records with the same **Name** and **Type**. Accepts up to *45 characters*. 
11. Click the **Save** button.

## Via API

1. Run the following `GET` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) to retrieve your `<hosted_zone_id>`:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/intelligent_dns' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3'
```

2. You'll receive a response with all your existing edge firewalls. Copy the value of the `<id>` that you want to use.
3. Run the following `POST` request, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and the `<hosted_zone_id>` value you copied:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/intelligent_dns/<hosted_zone_id>/records' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--data-raw '{
    "record_type": "CNAME",
    "entry": "www",
    "answers_list": [
        "www.mydomain.com"
    ],
    "ttl": 20,
    "description": "description"
}'
```

4. You'll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
  "results": {
    "answers_list": [
      "www.mydomain.com"
    ],
    "zone_id": 1234,
    "record_type": "CNAME",
    "ttl": 20,
    "policy": "simple",
    "entry": "www",
    "id": 12345,
    "description": "description"
  },
  "schema_version": 3
}
```

Wait a few minutes for the changes to propagate and your records will be created in the hosted zone you chose.
