[Azion Terraform Provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/aziontech/azion/latest/docs) is a robust tool that integrates seamlessly with Terraform, the industry-leading Infrastructure as Code (IaC) platform.

## Security with Terraform

In modern web, security is key. Terraform addresses this concern by codifying infrastructure. This approach allows security configurations to be defined, versioned, and audited in tandem with application code, ensuring uniformity across different environments and significantly reducing the risk of misconfigurations.

## Automation with Terraform

One of the primary benefits of Terraform is its automation capabilities. It simplifies repetitive tasks, thereby reducing the likelihood of human error and accelerating deployment processes. By codifying infrastructure, Terraform enables the use of reusable modules and templates. This not only boosts efficiency but also ensures the consistent application of security measures throughout the infrastructure lifecycle.
