[Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS)](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/domains/mtls/) is a security protocol that enables two-way authentication and encryption for network interaction. It confirms that both the client and the server are authenticated and have the clearance for effective communication.

To configure mTLS in your applications, you need a [digital certificate](/en/documentation/products/guides/secure/digital-certificates/) with mTLS support signed by a third-party certificate authority (CA). At Azion, this type of certificate is called a **Trusted CA**.

## Adding a Trusted CA certificate and associating it to a domain

### Via RTM

1. Access [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/) > **Digital Certificates**.
2. Click the **Add certificate** button.
3. Select the **Trusted CA Certificate** option from the dropdown.
4. Give your certificate an easy-to-remember name.
5. In the **Certificate** field, paste your Trusted CA, including the begin and end tags.

:::caution[warning]
The certificate file must be in Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) format, which ends with the `.pem` file extension. Certificates in other formats aren't accepted.
:::

6. Click the **Save** button.

After adding a **Trusted CA** to your certificate library, you need to configure which domains should operate with mTLS.

1. Access [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/) > **Domains**.
2. Click on the domain you'd like to configure **mTLS** for.
3. Enable the **Enable Mutual Authentication (mTLS)** switch.
4. Choose which verification mode you wish to use.
  - By selecting **Enforce** (default), mTLS is enabled in your edge application's domain and all incoming traffic will comply with client and server authentication.
  - By selecting **Permissive**, you must [configure this mode in Edge Firewall](#add-specific-rules-for-using-permissive-mtls).
5. Select the **Trusted CA Certificate** you created.
6. Click the **Save** button.

:::caution[warning]
The **Permissive** mode is recommended when testing access to your application under specific conditions. Misconfiguring the **Permissive** verification mode can result in security faults. 
:::

### Via API

1. Run the following `POST` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and the certificate in the `certificate` property:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/digital_certificates' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{

        "certificate_type": "trusted_ca_certificate",
        "managed": false
    }
}
```

3. Copy the `digital_certificate_id` value. You'll need it while associating it with a domain.
4. Run the following `POST` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/), the `<edge_application_id>` with an edge application ID, and the `<digital_certificate_id>` with the ID of the Trusted CA you created:

```bash

## Creating specific rules for Permissive mTLS

To configure a firewall to block access to a domain using the **Permissive** mode in mTLS, you must use the [Rules Engine for Edge Firewall](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/rules-engine/). The following example describes a rule set that will block any incoming network traffic with the hostname `mydomain.com` whose client certificate validation isn't true and deliver a `403 Forbidden` error.

### Via RTM

1. Access [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/) > **Edge Firewall**.
2. [Configure an edge firewall](/en/documentation/products/guides/secure/configure-main-settings/) for the mTLS domain.
3. Click the **Rules Engine** tab of the **Edge Firewall**.
4. Click the **New Rule** button.
5. Give your rule an easy-to-remember name.
6. In the **Criteria** section, as a variable, select **Hostname**.
7. As a comparison operator, select **is equal**.
8. As an argument, enter `mydomain.com`.
9. Click the **+ And** button to add a new criteria.
10. As a variable, select **Client Certificate Validation**.
11. As a comparison operator, select **is not equal to**.
12. As an argument, enter `true`.
13. In the **Behavior** section, select **Deny (403 Forbidden)**.
14. Click the **Save** button.

### Via API

1. Run the following `POST` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and the `<edge_firewall_id>` with the ID of the firewall associated with the mTLS domain:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_firewall/<edge_firewall_id>/rules_engine' \

## Specifying mTLS variables in HTTP headers

If your application is part of the Open Banking model, you must specify the variables `${ssl_client_escaped_cert}` and `${ssl_client_s_dn_parsed}` in the HTTP headers of your application. You can use the [Rules Engine for Edge Application](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/rules-engine/) to create this behavior for your whole application.

Requires:
- <Badge variant="accent">[Application Acceleration](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/configure-main-settings/#modules)</Badge>
- <Badge variant="accent">[Domain with an mTLS certificate](#add-a-trusted-ca-certificate-and-associate-it-to-a-domain)</Badge>

:::tip
You can also insert headers with other variables from [the list of available mTLS variables](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/rules-engine/#mutual-transport-layer-security-mtls-variables).
:::

To test whether the headers you add are being sent in requests, you can run the following cURL command in your terminal from a directory containing the `.pem` files of your Trusted CA and its private key:

```bash
curl -skv https://mydomain.com/ -H "Pragma: azion-debug-cache" -o /dev/stdout --cert cert.pem --key key.pem
```

### Via RTM

1. Access [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/) > **Edge Application**.
2. Find and click on the application with the mTLS domain.
4. Click the **Rules Engine** tab.
5. Click the **New Rule** button and select **Request Phase**.
6. Give your rule an easy-to-remember name.
7. In the **Criteria** field, enter the desired mTLS variable. Example: `${ssl_client_escaped_cert}`.
8. Select the comparison operator **exists**.
9. In the **Behaviors** section, select the **Add Response Header** behavior.
10. As an argument, enter `Mtls-Variable-Name: ${ssl_variable_name}`, replacing the name and variable with the mTLS variable you wish to insert in your application's header.
    - Example: `Escaped-Client-Cert: ${ssl_client_escaped_cert}`

:::note
The use of the prefix `X-` in the header name of custom HTTP variables is discouraged by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) under [RFC 6648](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc6648/). The IETF recommends using a simple `Header-Name` format to indicate the actual use of the variable.
:::

11. To add another variable, click the **And** button in the **Criteria** section and repeat the remaining steps.
12. Click the **Save** button when you're done.

### Via API

1. Run the following `POST` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and the `<edge_application_id>` with the ID of the application associated with the mTLS domain:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_applications/<edge_application_id>/rules_engine/request/rules' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--data '{
    "name": "mTLS variables",
    "description": "Adds certificate values according to Open Banking standards",
    "phase": "request",
    "behaviors": [
        {
            "name": "add_request_header",
            "target": "Escaped-Client-Cert: ${ssl_client_escaped_cert}"
        }
    ],
    "criteria": [
        [
            {
                "variable": "${ssl_client_escaped_cert}",
                "operator": "exists",
                "conditional": "if",
                "input_value": ""
            }
        ]
    ]
}'
```

2. You'll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
  "results": {
      "id": <rule_id>,
      "name": "mTLS variables",
      "phase": "request",
      "behaviors": [
          {
              "name": "add_request_header",
              "target": "Escaped-Client-Cert: ${ssl_client_escaped_cert}"
          }
      ],
      "criteria": [
          [
              {
                  "variable": "${ssl_client_escaped_cert}",
                  "operator": "exists",
                  "conditional": "if",
                  "input_value": ""
              }
          ]
      ],
      "description": "Adds certificate values according to Open Banking standards"
  }
}
```

3. Repeat the previous step for each mTLS variable required in the headers.
