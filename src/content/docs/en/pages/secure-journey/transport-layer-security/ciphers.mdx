HTTPS applications require additional security configurations in the form of TLS cryptography. When you [configure an edge application](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/configure-main-settings/) with Azion, you can select the minimum TLS version supported and which cipher suite is used by the application.

There are separate instructions for API v3, which uses Delivery settings previously located within Edge Application Main Settings, and for API v4, where Delivery Settings have been moved to the new [Workloads](/en/documentation/products/secure/workloads) product.

:::tip
In this guide, there are separate instructions for API v3 and API v4. If you're not sure which steps apply to your account, see [the Verify Your Account Migration guide](/en/documentation/products/guides/verify-account-migration/) to determine if your account has already been migrated.

## Configuring an HTTPS application

To enable the HTTPS protocol for your application:

    <Fragment slot="tab.apiv3">API v3</Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.apiv4">API v4</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.consoleworkloads">

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Workloads**.
2. Click the Workload you want to configure.
3. In **Protocol Settings**, select the **HTTP and HTTPS support**.

Now to specify the [minimum TLS version](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/main-settings/#minimum-tls-version) and the [cipher suite](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/main-settings/#tls-ciphers) supported by your application:

1. In **Minimum TLS version**, select **TLS 1.2**.
2. Under **Cipher suite**, select **TLSv1.2_2021**.
3. Click the **Save** button.

It may take some time to propagate your changes to the edge. To verify whether your changes took place, you can inspect the `https://xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net` page using your browser and locate the security settings of the application. You can also [run the DIG command](/en/documentation/products/guides/run-the-dig-command/) to get more information on your security settings.

The application may still be running in TLS 1.3, since you selected the minimum version and *not the exact TLS version* used. However, you can check the cipher suite being used against the [list of supported ciphers](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/main-settings/#tls-ciphers) to verify whether the changes took place.

1. Run the following `GET` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) to retrieve your `<workload_id>`:

<Code lang="bash" code={`
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.azion.com/v4/workspace/workloads \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]'
`} />

2. You'll receive a response with all your existing edge applications. Copy the value of the `<workload_id>` that you want to configure.
3. Run a `PATCH` request to modify the application as follows:

<Code lang="bash" code={`
curl --request PATCH \
  --url https://api.azion.com/v4/workspace/workloads/<workload_id> \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "tls": {
      "minimum_version": "tls_1_2",
      "ciphers": 4
    },
    "protocols": {
      "http": {
        "versions": ["http1", "http2"],
        "http_ports": [80],
        "https_ports": [443]
      }
    }
  }'
`} />

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `protocols` | Enables the HTTP and HTTPS protocols |
| `minimum_tls_version` | Enum that establishes the minimum TLS version |
| `ciphers` | Enum that sets the supported cipher suite. See the full list of [list of supported ciphers](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/main-settings/#tls-ciphers) for further details |

4. You'll receive a response similar to this:

<Code lang="json" code={`

      "workload_domain": "xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net",
      "product_version": "1.0"
    },
`} />


5. Wait a few minutes for the changes to propagate.
6. Check the supported cipher suite by inspecting the page or [running the DIG command](/en/documentation/products/guides/run-the-dig-command/).
