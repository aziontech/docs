HTTPS applications require additional security configurations in the form of TLS cryptography. When you [configure an edge application](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/configure-main-settings/) with Azion, you can select the minimum TLS version supported and which cipher suite is used by the application.

## Configuring an HTTPS application

### Via RTM

To enable the HTTPS protocol for your application:

1. [Access Real-Time Manager (RTM)](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/) > **Edge Application**.
2. Click the application you want to configure.
3. Switch the **Delivery Protocol** to **HTTP & HTTPS**.
4. Click the **Save** button.

Now to specify the [minimum TLS version](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/build/main-settings/#minimum-tls-version) and the [cipher suite](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/build/main-settings/#tls-ciphers) supported by your application:

1. Click the application you want to configure.
2. In the **Main Settings** tab of the application, under **Minimum TLS version**, select **TLS 1.2**.
3. Under **Supported Ciphers list**, select **TLSv1.2_2021**.
4. Click the **Save** button.

It may take some time to propagate your changes to the edge. To verify whether your changes took place, you can inspect the `https://xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net` page using your browser and locate the security settings of the application. You can also [run the DIG command](/en/documentation/products/guides/run-the-dig-command/) to get more information on your security settings.

The application may still be running in TLS 1.3, since you selected the minimum version and *not the exact TLS version* used. However, you can check the cipher suite being used against the [list of supported ciphers](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/build/main-settings/#tls-ciphers) to verify whether the changes took place.

### Via API

1. Run the following `GET` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) to retrieve your `<edge_application_id>`:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_applications \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]'
```

2. You'll receive a response with all your existing edge applications. Copy the value of the `<edge_application_id>` that you want to configure.
3. Run a `PATCH` request to modify the application as follows:

```bash
curl --location --request PATCH 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_applications/<edge_application_id>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--data '{
    "delivery_protocol": "http,https",
    "minimum_tls_version": "tls_1_2",
    "supported_ciphers": "TLSv1.2_2021"
}'
```

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `delivery_protocol` | Enables the HTTP and HTTPS protocols |
| `minimum_tls_version` | Enum that establishes the minimum TLS version |
| `supported_ciphers` | Enum that sets the supported cipher suite. See the full list of [list of supported ciphers](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/build/main-settings/#tls-ciphers) for further details |

4. You'll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
    "results": {
        "id": <edge_application_id>,
        "name": "example.org",
        "delivery_protocol": "http,https",
        "http_port": [
            80,
            8008
        ],
        "https_port": [
            443
        ],
        "minimum_tls_version": "tls_1_2",
        "active": true,
        "debug_rules": false,
        "http3": false,
        "websocket": false,
        "supported_ciphers": "TLSv1.2_2021",
        "application_acceleration": true,
        "caching": true,
        "device_detection": false,
        "edge_firewall": false,
        "edge_functions": true,
        "image_optimization": false,
        "l2_caching": false,
        "load_balancer": false,
        "raw_logs": false,
        "web_application_firewall": false
    }
}
```

5. Wait a few minutes for the changes to propagate.
6. Check the supported cipher suite by inspecting the page or [running the DIG command](/en/documentation/products/guides/run-the-dig-command/).
