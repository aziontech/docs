Implementing rules in your edge firewall using [Rules Engine](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/rules-engine/) will allow you to determine the rules it should execute in specific scenarios.

:::note
There are different criteria that require different Edge Firewall modules. Make sure you have the [right module](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/rules-engine/#criteria) activated to create your rules.
:::

This guide demonstrates the process of creating a rule with a practical example of verifying the existence of a certificate and returning a custom response when there isn't one. This behavior is useful in scenarios such as adjusting your policies to comply with BACEN requirements.

## Via RTM

To create a rule:

1. [On RTM](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/), navigate to **Edge Firewall**.
2. Select the edge firewall in which you want to configure the rule.
3. Click the **Rules Engine* tab.
4. Click the **New Rule** button.
5. Give your rule a name and, optionally, a description.
6. In the **Criteria** section, select the `SSL Verification Status` variable.
7. As a comparison operator, select `is esqual`.
8. As an argument, select `Missing Client Certificate`.
9. In the **Behaviors** section, select **Set Custom Response**.
10. As arguments:
    - On **Status Code**, add `401`.
    - On **Content Type**, add the content and header description. Example: `application/json`.
    - On **Content Body**, pass the message you want to present to users.
11. Click the **Save** button.

## Via API

1. Run the following `POST` request to create a rule, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and the `<edge_firewall_id>` variable with your [edge firewall id](https://api.azion.com/#58376993-e0dd-4b51-9cd3-41d86122728f) value:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_firewall/<edge_firewall_id>/rules_engine' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "name": "SSL Verification",
    "is_active": true,
    "behaviors": [
        {
            "name": "set_custom_response",
            "status_code": 401,
            "content_type": "application/json",
            "content_body": "{}"
        }
    ],
    "criteria": [
        [
            {
                "variable": "ssl_verification_status",
                "operator": "is_equal",
                "conditional": "if",
                "argument": "MISSING_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE"
            }
        ]
    ]
}'
```

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | Name of the rule |
| `description` | Description of the rule |
| `behaviors` | Array that stores objects that define behaviors |
| `criteria` | Array that stores objects that define criteria |

2. You'll receive the following response:

```json
{
  "results": {
    "name": "SSL Verification",
    "is_active": true,
    "behaviors": [
      {
        "status_code": 401,
        "content_body": "{}",
        "name": "set_custom_response",
        "content_type": "application/json"
      }
    ],
    "criteria": [
      [
        {
          "variable": "ssl_verification_status",
          "operator": "is_equal",
          "conditional": "if",
          "argument": "MISSING_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE"
        }
      ]
    ],
    "last_modified": "2023-11-23T23:54:14.941097Z",
    "last_editor": "hannah.kahn+rtm@azion.com",
    "id": 28414,
    "order": 2
  },
  "schema_version": 3
}
```

3. Wait a few minutes for the changes to propagate.
