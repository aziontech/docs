:::caution[important]
Azion has two user interfaces: Real-Time Manager and Console, which is in *Preview* stage. Currently, Console is only available for Developer plans and new accounts. Follow the steps according to the user interface you're using.
:::

Once you create an edge firewall with Azion, you can modify a few configurations. In this guide, you'll learn to modify the domains associated with your firewall and to enable the available modules.

In this section, you'll modify the main settings of your edge firewalls: name, domains, and modules via [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com).

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/) > select **Edge Firewall**.
2. From the list, select the edge firewall you want to edit or click **+ Edge Firewall** to create a new one.
3. Give your edge firewall a unique and easy-to-remember name.

### Domains

In the **Domains** section, you'll choose the domains associated with this edge firewall. This means that all configurations made in this edge firewall will be associated with the selected domains.

1. On the **Available** box, you can:
    - Scroll through the list of your domains.
    - Select each domain you want to associate with this edge firewall and click the `>` button.
    - Select multiple domains by using **ctrl** on Windows and Linux or **command** on Mac and click the `>` button.
    - Select `>>` to move all domains presented on the list.
2. After you click the `>` button, the selected domains are moved to the **Selected** box.
    - You can also use the `<` button to remove specific domains already chosen or select `<<` to remove all domains.

### Modules

[Modules](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-firewall/#about-edge-firewall-modules) can unlock additional functionalities and features related to your configured firewalls. See the [Pricing page](/en/documentation/products/pricing/) for more details.

There are four available modules that can be activated with your edge firewall:

- <Tag severity="info" client:only="vue">[DDoS Protection Unmetered](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-firewall/ddos-protection/)</Tag>
Protects your content and applications against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Automatically enabled in all accounts.

- <Tag severity="info" client:only="vue">[Edge Functions](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-firewall/edge-functions/)</Tag>
Enables you to run serverless functions on Azion's edge with low latency, bringing the operational power closer to the end user.

- <Tag severity="info" client:only="vue">[Network Layer Protection](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-firewall/network-layer-protection/)</Tag>
Allows the creation of filters by IP/CIDR, ASN addresses, or by countries (geolocation) through the configuration of Network Lists and the definition of business rules that will validate blocking or releasing Criteria.

- <Tag severity="info" client:only="vue">[Web Application Firewall](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-firewall/web-application-firewall/)</Tag> Protects your applications against threats such as SQL Injections, Remote File Inclusion (RFI), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and many others.

You can choose between the list of modules: you can select one, a few, or even all.

### Debug rules

You'll also find a switch labeled **Debug Rules**. If you enable the switch, you'll turn on the feature that allows you to check if the rules you've created using Rules Engine for Edge Firewall have been successfully executed in your application.

<LinkButton link="/en/documentation/products/guides/debug-rules/" label="go to How to debug rules guide" outlined />

### Status

You'll also find a switch labeled **Active**. You can enable the switch to activate your edge firewall, and disable the switch if you no longer want this edge firewall active.

Once you're done configuring your main settings, click the **Save** button.

In this section, you'll modify the main settings of your edge firewalls: name, domains, and modules via [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).

1. Access [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/) > select **Edge Firewall**.
2. From the list, select the edge firewall you want to edit or click **Add Rule Set** to create a new one.
3. Give your edge firewall a unique and easy-to-remember name.

### Domains

In the **Domains** section, you'll choose the domains associated with this edge firewall. This means that all configurations made in this edge firewall will be associated with the selected domains.

1. On the **Available Domains** box, you can:
    - Type characters or words to find domains or scroll through the list of your domains.
    - Select each domain you want to associate with this edge firewall and click the `>` button.
    - Select multiple domains by using **ctrl** on Windows and Linux or **command** on Mac and click the `>` button.
    - Select **Choose all** to select all domains presented on the list.

- <Tag severity="info" client:only="vue">[DDoS Protection Unmetered](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-firewall/ddos-protection/)</Tag>

1. Run the following `GET` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) to retrieve your `<edge_firewall_id>`:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_firewall \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]'
```

2. You'll receive a response with all your existing edge firewalls. Copy the value of the `<id>` that you want to configure.
3. Run a `PATCH` request to modify the firewall as follows:

```bash
curl --location --request PATCH 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_firewall/<edge_firewall_id>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "name": "My edge firewall",
    "domains": [
        <domains_id>
    ],
    "is_active": true,
        "edge_functions_enabled": true,
        "network_protection_enabled": true,
        "waf_enabled": true,
    "debug_rules": true
}'
```

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | Name of the edge firewall |
| `domains` | Array of IDs of the domains you want to associate with this edge firewall |
| `is_active` | Boolean value that enables (`true`) or disables (`false`) the edge firewall |
| `edge_functions_enabled` | Boolean value that enables (`true`) or disables (`false`) the [Edge Functions](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-firewall/edge-functions/) module |
| `network_protection_enabled` | Boolean value that enables (`true`) or disables (`false`) the [Network Layer Protection](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-firewall/network-layer-protection/) module |
| `waf_enabled` | Boolean value that enables (`true`) or disables (`false`) the [Web Application Firewall (WAF)](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-firewall/web-application-firewall/) module |
| `debug_rules` | Boolean value that enables (`true`) or disables (`false`) the [Debug Rules](/en/documentation/products/guides/debug-rules/) feature |

4. You'll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
    "results": {
        "name": My edge firewall",
        "waf_enabled": true,
        "is_active": true,
        "edge_functions_enabled": true,
        "last_modified": "2023-06-01T18:00:11.994514Z",
        "domains": [
            0123456789
        ],
        "last_editor": "last.editor@azion.com",
        "network_protection_enabled": true,
        "id": 12345,
        "debug_rules": false
    },
    "schema_version": 3
}
```

Wait a few minutes for the changes to propagate and your edge firewall will be updated.
