Once you create an edge firewall with Azion, you can modify a few configurations. In this guide, you'll learn to modify the domains and the modules enabled in your firewall.

## Via RTM

In this section, you'll modify some configurations of your application.

1. [Access RTM](https://manager.azion.com).
2. On the upper-left corner of the page, open the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, and select **Edge Application**.
3. Click the edge application you want to configure. From this screen, you can alter the application's name, delivery settings, and which modules it uses.

The following steps will guide you through editing an edge application's settings for a boilerplate application. Feel free to change these settings whenever necessary to suit your requirements.

### Domains

Modify your application to support the available [delivery protocols](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/main-settings/#delivery-protocols).

1. Go to the **Main Settings** tab.
2. Under **Delivery Protocol**, switch to **HTTP & HTTPS**.
3. Click the **Save** button.

### Modules

[Modules](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/#modules) can unlock additional functionalities and features for your applications. See the [Pricing page](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/) for more details.

For now, you'll enable two modules. The **Application Acceleration** and **Edge Functions** modules will be used for when you [tune your cache settings](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/tune-cache-settings/), [instantiate an edge function](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/instantiate-edge-functions/), and [work with Rules Engine](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/work-with-rules-engine/). 

If you're an [Account owner](/en/documentation/products/guides/users-management/), start by enabling the following modules for your account:

1. [Access RTM](https://manager.azion.com).
2. On the top-right corner, click the **Account menu**.
3. Select **Billing & Subscriptions**.
4. Navigate to the **Subscriptions** tab.
5. Enable the **Application Acceleration** and **Edge Functions** switches.
6. Click the **Save** button.

:::note[Optional]
You may also take this chance to update your payment method on the **Payment Methods** tab.
:::

7. On the upper-left corner of the page, open the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, and then select **Edge Application**.
8. Click the edge application you want to configure.
9. Enable the modules **Application Acceleration** and **Edge Functions**.
10. Click the **Save** button.

## Via API

1. Run the following `GET` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) to retrieve your `<edge_application_id>`:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_applications \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]'
```

2. You'll receive a response with all your existing edge applications. Copy the value of the `<edge_application_id>` that you want to configure.
3. Run a `PATCH` request to modify the application as follows:

```bash
curl --location --request PATCH 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_applications/<edge_application_id>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--data '{
    "delivery_protocol": "http,https",
    "http_port": [80, 8008],
    "https_port": [443, 8443],
    "minimum_tls_version": "tls_1_2",
    "supported_ciphers": "TLSv1.2_2021",
    "edge_functions": true,
    "application_acceleration": true
}'
```

  | Key | Description |
  | --- | --- |
  | `delivery_protocol` | When set to `http,https`, enables the HTTPS protocol support. |
  | `http_port` | Sets new HTTPS ports to the application. In this case, the array `[80, 8008]` defines that both ports 80 and 8008 can be used by HTTP requests. |
  | `https_port` | Sets new HTTPS ports to the application. In this case, the array `[443, 8443]` defines that both ports 443 and 8443 can be used by HTTP requests. |
  | `minimum_tls_version` | When set to `tls_1_2`, establishes that the minimum TLS version should be 1.2. |
  | `supported_ciphers` | Sets the supported cipher suite, with its value in this case being `TLSv1.2_2021`. See the full list of [list of supported ciphers](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/main-settings/#ciphers) for further details.
  | `edge_functions` | Enables the **Edge Functions** module. |
  | `application_acceleration` | Enables the **Application Acceleration** module. |

4. You'll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
    "results": {
        "id": <edge_application_id>,
        "name": "example.org",
        "delivery_protocol": "http,https",
        "http_port": [
            80,
            8008
        ],
        "https_port": [
            443,
            8443
        ],
        "minimum_tls_version": "tls_1_2",
        "active": true,
        "debug_rules": false,
        "http3": false,
        "websocket": false,
        "supported_ciphers": "TLSv1.2_2021",
        "application_acceleration": true,
        "caching": true,
        "device_detection": false,
        "edge_firewall": false,
        "edge_functions": true,
        "image_optimization": false,
        "l2_caching": false,
        "load_balancer": false,
        "raw_logs": false,
        "web_application_firewall": false
    }
}
```

5. Wait a few minutes for the changes to propagate.
6. Test your changes by accessing your application using the HTTPS protocol and custom ports configured above. You can access your application through a browser using the address `https://xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net:8443` and inspect the page or use the following cURL command for a `2xx` or `3xx` status response:

```bash
curl -I https://xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net:8443
```

7. Check the supported cipher suite by inspecting the page or [running the DIG command](/en/documentation/products/guides/run-the-dig-command/).
