Once you create an edge firewall with Azion, you can modify a few configurations. 

In this guide, you'll learn how to select an edge firewall to protect a particular domain.

On the Console, you must now configure your domain so your edge firewall protects it.

There are separate instructions for API v3 using [legacy Domains](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/domains/) settings and API v4 using the new [Workloads](/en/documentation/products/secure/workloads) product.

If you're not sure which steps apply to your account, see [the Verify Your Account Migration guide](/en/documentation/products/guides/verify-account-migration/) to determine if your account has already been migrated.
