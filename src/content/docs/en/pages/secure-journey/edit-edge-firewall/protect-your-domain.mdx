Once you create an edge firewall with Azion, you can modify a few configurations. 

In this guide, you'll learn how to select an edge firewall to protect a particular domain.

On the Console, you must now configure your domain so your edge firewall protects it.

1. On the **Products menu**, select **Domains**.
2. Click on the domain you want to protect with your edge firewall.
3. In the **Settings** section, click the `Edge Firewall` selector and choose the edge firewall.
4. Click the **Save** button.

Done. Now the selected edge firewall will protect the domain you indicated.
