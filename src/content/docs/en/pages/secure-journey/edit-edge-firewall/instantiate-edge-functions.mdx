Instantiate [serverless functions](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-firewall/edge-functions-instances/) directly within your edge firewall.

:::caution[warning]
You must activate the [Edge Functions](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-firewall/edge-functions/) module to implement functions in your applications. If **Edge Functions** is activated, computing time and invocations could generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](/en/documentation/products/pricing/) for more information.
:::

This guide uses the configured [Deny a request based on Geoip](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-functions/javascript-examples/deny-request/) function. You can repeat this process using any function already available on [Azion Marketplace](/en/documentation/products/marketplace/) or [develop other functions](/en/documentation/products/guides/edge-functions/api-builder/).

This guide will also presume you have a network list of the [Countries type](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-firewall/network-layer-protection/network-lists/#types-of-network-lists).

## Via Azion Console

1. [Access Azion Console](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/) > select **Edge Firewall*.
2. Click the edge firewall you want to configure.
3. Enable the **Edge Functions** module switch to enable functions.
4. Click the **Save** button.
5. Go to the **Functions** tab.
6. Click **Add Function**.
7. Name your function instance. For example: `Deny Geoip function`.
8. On the **Edge Functions** dropdown, select the function you want to use. In this example, `Deny Geoip function`.
    - You can't change the **Code**, but if you want, you can edit the **Args**.
8. Click the **Save** button.

The functions page now lists the newly created instance. However, this new function isn't yet active in your application. You need to define what will trigger the function.

Still on the **Edge Firewall** page:

1. Navigate to the **Rules Engine** tab.
2. Click the **Add Rule** button.
3. Give a name to your rule.
4. Under the **Criteria** section, select the variable `Network`.
5. As a comparison operator, select **matches**.
6. As an argument, select the network list of the Countries type you want to use. For example: `Blocked Countries Geoip`.
7. In the **Behaviors** section, select **Run Function** from the behavior list.
8. Select the function you want to use. In this example, `Deny Geoip function`.
9. Click the **Save** button.

Once your application receives a request generated from one of the countries in the network list, the function in your firewall will deny the request based on the geo IP.

## Via API

1. Run the following `PATCH` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and the `<edge_firewall_id>` variable with [your edge firewall ID](https://api.azion.com/#58376993-e0dd-4b51-9cd3-41d86122728f) to activate the **Edge Functions** module:

```bash
curl --location --request PATCH 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_firewall/<edge_firewall_id>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "edge_functions_enabled": true
}'
```

2. You'll receive a response with the updated value.
3. Run the following `GET` request to retrieve the `edge_function_id` of the `Deny Geoip function` function:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_functions' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]'
```

4. You'll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
  "count": 1,
  "total_pages": 1,
  "schema_version": 3,
  "links": {
    "previous": null,
    "next": null

      "name": "Deny Geoip function",
      "language": "javascript",
      "code": "async function firewallHandler(event){\n    // Access the country code through geoip\n    let countryCode = event.request.metadata[\"geoip_country_code\"]\n\n    // Do some logic here\n    // In this example, we are blocking access from Brazil\n    if (countryCode === \"BR\"){\n        event.deny();\n    }\n\n    // Then, if it comes from any other country,\n    // the processing continues\n    event.continue();\n}\n\naddEventListener(\"firewall\", (event)=>event.waitUntil(firewallHandler(event)));",
      "json_args": {
        "value": "hello_world"
      },
      "function_to_run": "",
      "initiator_type": "edge_firewall",
      "active": true,
      "last_editor": "user@email.com",

      "is_proprietary_code": false,
      "reference_count": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

5. Copy the `<edge_function_id>` value.
6. Run the following `POST` request, replacing the `<edge_firewall_id>` variable with [your edge firewall ID](https://api.azion.com/#58376993-e0dd-4b51-9cd3-41d86122728f) and the `<edge_function_id>` value with the value you received in the previous response:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_firewall/<edge_firewall_id>/functions_instances' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
		"name": "Deny Geoip",
  		"edge_function": <edge_function_id>,
  		"json_args": {}
}'
```

7. You'll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
  "results": {
    "name": "Another function",
    "json_args": {},
    "edge_function": 13426,
    "last_modified": "2023-11-22T18:50:11.812819Z",
    "last_editor": "hannah.kahn+rtm@azion.com",
    "id": 2806
  },
  "schema_version": 3
}
```

| Key | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| `name` | Name of the instantiated function |
| `edge_function` | The ID of the edge function. This isn't the same as the ID of the instantiated function, which is unique for each application's function instance |
| `json_args` | Definition of arguments required for the function. Some functions don't take arguments |

8. Run the following `GET` to retrieve the `id` of the `Blocked Countries Geoip` network list:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/network_lists' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]'
```

9. You'll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
  "count": 2,
  "total_pages": 1,
  "schema_version": 3,
  "links": {
    "previous": null,
    "next": null
  },
  "results": [
    {
      "id": 6217,
      "last_editor": "hannah.kahn+rtm@azion.com",
      "last_modified": "2023-11-14T21:35:39.808175Z",
      "list_type": "countries",
      "name": "Deny Geoip",
      "country_list": [
        "Brazil"
      ],
      "ip_list": []
    }
  ]
}
}
```

| Key | Description |

| `name` | Name of the network list |
| `id` | ID of the network list |
| `list_type` | Definition of the type of the network list |
| `country_list` | Items that compose the list |
  
10. Run the following `POST` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/), the `<edge_firewall_id>` variable with your edge firewall ID, the `<edge_function_instance_id>` value with the function instance ID, and the `<<network_list_id>>` value with the network list ID:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_firewall/<edge_firewall_id>/rules_engine' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "name": "Create rule",
    "is_active": true,
    "behaviors": [
        {
            "name": "run_function",
            "argument": <edge_function_instance_id>
        }
    ],
    "criteria": [
        [
            {
                "variable": "network",
                "operator": "is_in_list",
                "conditional": "if",
                "argument": <network_list_id>
            }
        ]
    ]
}'
```

:::note
For more information on the rules endpoint, see [Work with Rules Engine](/en/documentation/products/guides/secure/work-with-rules-engine/).
:::

11. You'll receive a response similar to this, confirming your function was created successfully:

```json
{
  "results": {
    "name": "Create rule",
    "is_active": true,
    "behaviors": [
      {
        "name": "run_function",
        "argument": 2718
      }
    ],
    "criteria": [
      [
        {
          "variable": "network",
          "operator": "is_in_list",
          "conditional": "if",
          "argument": 6217
        }
      ]
    ],
    "last_modified": "2023-11-22T17:57:28.584143Z",
    "last_editor": "hannah.kahn+rtm@azion.com",
    "id": 28370,
    "order": 1
  },
  "schema_version": 3
}
```

12. Wait a few minutes for the changes to propagate.

Once your application receives a request generated from one of the countries in the network list, the function in your firewall will deny the request based on the geo IP.
