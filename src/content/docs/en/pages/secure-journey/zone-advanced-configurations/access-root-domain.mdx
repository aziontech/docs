You can configure your **Edge DNS** to allow access to an address through its root domain, also known as naked domain or apex domain, by using an **ANAME record**.

<Button href="/en/documentation/products/guides/secure/add-records/" text="go to add records guide" variant="secondary"></Button>

For this guide, assume you're configuring a record for a zone with the `domain.com` root domain.

## Via Azion Console

1. Follow the general steps described in the [How to add records](/en/documentation/products/guides/secure/add-records/) guide.
2. In **Name**, leave it blank. This way, you'll use your root domain, `domain.com`.
3. In the **Type** dropdown menu, select **ANAME**.
4. In **Value**, add the IP addresses you want to make available through the root domain. Must be in FQDN format. Example: `32082s.map.azionedge.net`
5. Choose the type of **Policy**: **Simple** or **Weighted**.
6. Click the **Save** button.

## Via API

1. Run the following `GET` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) to retrieve your `<hosted_zone_id>`:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/intelligent_dns' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3'
```

2. You'll receive a response with all your existing zones. Copy the value of the `<id>` that you want to use.
3. Run the following `POST` request, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and the `<hosted_zone_id>` value you copied:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/intelligent_dns/<hosted_zone_id>/records' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--data-raw '{
    "record_type": "ANAME",
    "answers_list": [
        "32082s.map.azionedge.net"
    ],
    "ttl": 20
}'
```

4. You'll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
  "results": {
    "answers_list": [
      "32082s.map.azionedge.net"
    ],
    "zone_id": 1234,
    "record_type": "ANAME",
    "ttl": 0,
    "policy": "simple",
    "entry": "",
    "id": 12345,
    "description": ""
  },
  "schema_version": 3
}
```

Wait a few minutes for the changes to propagate and your records will be created in the hosted zone you chose.
