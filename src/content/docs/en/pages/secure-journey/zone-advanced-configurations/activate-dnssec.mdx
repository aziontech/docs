**Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC)** provide an extra layer of security to verify the authenticity and integrity of an IP address response. Azion provides [DNSSEC compatibility](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-dns/dnssec-compatibility/) as long as your top-level domain (TLD) registry supports it and [your zone is configured](/en/documentation/products/guides/secure/edge-dns-configure-main-settings/) with DNSSEC-related resource records on [Edge DNS](/en/documentation/products/guides/secure/add-records/).

## Activate DNSSEC via API

DNSSEC activation is available via [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/#ea46919a-7130-426d-b38b-dc416b6c4c32):

1. Run the following `GET` request in your terminal, replacing [TOKEN VALUE] with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) to retrieve your `<zoneId>`:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.azion.com/v4/dns/zones \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: [TOKEN VALUE]'
```

2. You’ll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
  "count": 1,
  "links": {
    "previous": null,
    "next": null
  },
  "total_pages": 1,
  "results": [
    {
      "domain": "youdomain.com",
      "is_active": true,
      "name": "A hosted zone",
      "id": 1234
    }
  ],
  "schema_version": 3
}
```

3. Copy the `<id>` value of the specific zone in which you want to activate DNSSEC. In this example, it's `1234`.
4. Run the following `PATCH` request in your terminal, replacing [TOKEN VALUE] with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/):

```bash
curl --request PATCH \
  --url https://api.azion.com/v4/dns/zones/<zoneId>/dnssec \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: [TOKEN VALUE]' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "enabled": true
}'
```

5. You’ll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
  "results": {
    "is_enabled": true,
    "status": "waiting"
  },
  "schema_version": 3
}
```

6. Run the following `GET` request to retrieve the `digest` and `key_tag` replacing [TOKEN VALUE] with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and `<zoneId>`, you'll need these to configure DNSSEC in your domain Registrar.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.azion.com/v4/dns/zones/<zoneId>/dnssec \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: [TOKEN VALUE]'
```

:::caution[warning]
Your DNSSEC configuration is NOT complete until you finish the setup using the `digest` and `key_tag` values at your domain Registrar.
