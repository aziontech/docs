**Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC)** provide an extra layer of security to verify the authenticity and integrity of an IP address response. Azion provides [DNSSEC compatibility](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-dns/dnssec-compatibility/) as long as your top-level domain (TLD) registry supports it and [your zone is configured](/en/documentation/products/guides/secure/edge-dns-configure-main-settings/) with DNSSEC-related resource records on [Edge DNS](/en/documentation/products/guides/secure/add-records/).

## Activate DNSSEC via API

DNSSEC activation is available via [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/#f0f730a3-9739-40cf-ad07-0b7bca8abac8):

1. Run the following `GET` request in your terminal, replacing [TOKEN VALUE] with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) to retrieve your `<hosted_zone_id>`:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/intelligent_dns' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3'
```

2. You’ll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
  "count": 1,
  "links": {
    "previous": null,
    "next": null
  },
  "total_pages": 1,
  "results": [
    {
      "domain": "youdomain.com",
      "is_active": true,
      "name": "A hosted zone",
      "id": 1234
    }
  ],
  "schema_version": 3
}
```

3. Copy the `<id>` value of the specific zone in which you want to activate DNSSEC. In this example, it's `1234`.
4. Run the following `PATCH` request in your terminal, replacing [TOKEN VALUE] with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/):

```bash
curl --location --request PATCH 'https://api.azionapi.net/intelligent_dns/hosted_zone_id/dnssec' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "is_enabled": true
}'
```

5. You’ll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
  "results": {
    "is_enabled": true,
    "status": "waiting"
  },
  "schema_version": 3
}
```

Now, DNSSEC is active in the Edge DNS zone you specified.
