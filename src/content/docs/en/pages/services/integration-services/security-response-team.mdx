The **Security Response Team (SRT)** is a managed service that authorizes Azion to impose technical measures available on the Azion's platform to control or mitigate DDoS attacks, even if such measures may result in an eventual performance degradation. With 24/7 access, the SRT can be triggered during or after a DDoS attack and it'll assist in tracing incidents, identifying the root cause and applying mitigations. It's also possible to engage the SRT for any post-attack analysis. 

Customers with Enterprise or Mission Critical Service Plans have an hour package available for purchase and can request this service by contacting the [Sales](https://www.azion.com/en/contact-sales/) and Customer Success teams. 

For more detailed information, see [Service Plans options](/en/documentation/services/service-plans/).
