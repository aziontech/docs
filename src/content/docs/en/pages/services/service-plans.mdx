Azion's service plans are catalogs with different service level plans, which, added to the Azion platform's product portfolio, help the customer to build, secure, deploy, and observe their applications running on Azion, reducing costs and increasing competitive advantage, without worrying about internal processes to ensure increasingly efficient applications. Divided into 4 plans: **Developer**, **Business**, **Enterprise*, and **Mission Critical**, the Azion plans were designed to meet different needs and business sizes.
