**Edge computing** refers to a highly-distributed computing paradigm that aims to bring computation and data storage closer to the location where it's needed, typically near the "edge" of the network.

Edge computing enables the building and management of [modern applications](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/overview/) able to meet the growing demand for real-time processing, reduced latency, improved data privacy, and the ability to handle the massive amount of data generated by IoT (Internet of Things) devices and other sources.

With this approach, companies don't have to rely anymore just on a centralized cloud-based infrastructure and, consequently, it allows them to serve new use cases.

## Benefits of edge computing

- **Decentralized infrastructure and management**: edge computing involves managing a highly-distributed network composed of multiple edge nodes located closer to the user, without the need for intensive management and orchestration like in cloud and legacy architectures.
- **Proximity to data sources**: resources are placed as close as possible to the data sources or endpoints where data is generated or consumed. 
- **Low latency**: this proximity reduces the latency associated with transmitting data to and from a remote data center or cloud, being a good fit for applications that require real-time or near-real-time processing.
- **Bandwidth optimization**: less data need to be transmitted over the network to centralized data centers or the cloud, optimizing the network bandwidth usage and reducing costs associated with data transfer.
- **Scalability**: deploying additional edge devices or servers as needed is easier, achieving high scalability and flexibility for organizations that need to constantly adapt to changing workloads and requirements.
- **Resilience**: due to a distributed infrastructure and its fault-tolerant nature, edge computing platforms can continue to operate in case a node is under maintenance, enhancing the overall resilience and availability of applications and services.
- **Diverse ecosystem**: edge computing reinforces open standards and supports a diverse range of devices and systems, including edge servers, IoT devices, machines, sensors, gateways, hybrid and cloud integration, and more.
- **Data privacy and security**: due to sensitive or critical data being processed and stored locally rather than being sent to a remote data center, data privacy and security are enhanced.
- **New use cases**: edge computing enables innovative use cases that may not have been feasible due to latency and bandwidth constraints. For example: online fraud protection, Jamstack applications, workflow automation, IoT orchestration, infrastructure automation, and workload migration.
