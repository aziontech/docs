An **edge-native platform** is designed to operate efficiently at the edge of a network. For this reason, the platform should possess several key characteristics and functionalities to meet the unique challenges and requirements of edge computing.

## How to identify an edge-native platform

The characteristics and functionalities that define an edge-native platform include:

- **Seamless experience** for application development, security, orchestration, and observability: an edge platform must provide a smooth and cohesive environment for developers working with edge services. It involves providing tools, frameworks, SDks, and APIs that make it easy to build, deploy, and manage applications on the edge.
- **NoOps approach**: with an edge-native platform, developers can build without needing to deeply understand or manage the complexities of the edge infrastructure, allowing them to focus on application logic. A top-level edge-native platform should automate as many operational tasks as possible, including provisioning, scaling, load balancing, and monitoring. In the same way, developers should be able to self-service their application deployment and scaling needs.
- **Open standards**: it ensures the interoperability, portability, and flexibility of the platform, including data formats, communication protocols, and APIs that enable different edge devices and platforms to work together seamlessly. This guarantees that applications on edge platforms can communicate and interoperate with those built on another platform, allowing developers to access and utilize resources and services efficiently.
- **Built-in security features** that ensure reliability and observability: features such as encryption, authentication, and access control should be readily available and easy to configure, as well as the implementation of a zero-trust security model at the edge.
- **Continuous monitoring and observability**: developers gain insights into the performance and health of edge applications and infrastructure, enabling rapid detection and resolution of issues at the edge. These features cover real-time metrics and logs easily accessible, alerting and reporting mechanisms, and advanced tools to obtain real-time insights into application behavior and resource utilization.
- **Performance optimization tools**: the platform should continuously optimize resource allocation and application performance based on usage patterns and metrics, involving cost optimization, performance improvement, and resource utilization. These tools help ensure that edge applications and the infrastructure operate in an efficient way at peak performance levels.
- **Geographical coverage and traffic optimization strategies**: a wide network of edge locations plays a critical role to reduce the physical distance data must travel, therefore, minimizing latency and ensuring faster response times for applications. It also enables load balancing and scaling based on geographical demand, distributing the requests to the nearest available edge nodes, preventing overloads, assuring optimal resource utilization, improving resilience, and accelerating content delivery.

In this matter, the [2023 GigaOm Radar for Edge Platforms](https://www.azion.com/en/lp/gigaom-radar/) highlights two essential characteristics:

- **A multipurpose environment**: an edge-native platform must offer customers services with minimal latency, requesting vendors to manage many moving parts, such as computing, storage, web optimization, video streaming, and security, all at a global scale. These elements are brought together via orchestration, integration via DevOps tools, real-time configurations, interoperability through APIs, and support for continuous integration/continuous development (CI/CD) practices.
- **Global coverage**: edge platforms must enable their customers to move away from virtual private networks (VPNs) to more flexible and intelligent secure access technologies, using zero-trust network access (ZTNA) and user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA) to manage the access to the distributed infrastructure.

Ultimately, an edge-native platform should empower customers to efficiently harness the potential of edge computing while addressing challenges and constraints, such as latency, scalability, security, and efficiency. This enables organizations and developers to deploy edge applications and services that are faster, highly responsive, cost-effective, and adaptable to a variety of edge use cases.

### Azion as an edge-native platform

Azion is one of the leader companies included in the [GigaOm Radar for Edge Platforms](https://www.azion.com/en/blog/azion-named-leader-fast-mover-gigaom-report/), being considered as "the only purpose-built edge platform whose capabilities meet all the key criteria described in the report, ranking high on application and content delivery as well as content security".
