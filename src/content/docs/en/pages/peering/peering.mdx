The Azion Network Appliance (ANA) program plays an important role in Azion’s goal of delivering a full-stack edge platform from points of presence as close to end users as possible. 

In this program, partners agree to colocate Azion servers within their own access networks (central offices and edge data centers, for example) and. In return, Azion enables the partner’s subscribers to receive and transmit data at optimized latency, service reliability, security and scalability from within their network.

## Interconnection

### Peering

Azion Network Settlement-Free Interconnection (“Peering”) Policy and Requirements:

Azion is a global Edge Computing Company with edge locations (points of presence) across Latin America, the United States, Europe, and Africa. Azion peers with other Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and Content Networks with IPv4 connectivity on Autonomous System **(AS) 52580** for the purpose of exchanging traffic between these networks.

#### Selective Peering-Policy

Azion has a selective peering policy - peers are selected based upon performance, capability, and where traffic needs to be delivered. Peers are subject to certain operational, technical, and legal requirements.

### Technical Requirements

Partners who want to peer with Azion must meet the following technical requirements:


* have a publicly routed ASN.
* have a required minimum of 500 Mbps of traffic destined to or through your network. 
* both parties must provide a 24/7 contact so that critical issues can be scalated in a timely manner.
* not advertise prefixes with a mask longer than /24 for IPv4.
* demonstrate that announced publicly routable prefixes and/or aggregates are currently visible in the DFZ.
* announce a consistent set of prefixes to Azion at all points of interconnection, unless otherwise agreed upon.
* only send traffic destined for prefixes announced by Azion.
* not point a default route at Azion or use static routes to send traffic to our AS.
* set default maximum prefixes per session to 250 prefixes.
* register their prefixes with appropriate route/route6 objects at an appropriate IRRDB, and maintain a full and accurate PeeringDB listing. Azion will use this data to build BGP prefix lists and we ensure correctness of advertise of our peers (SFI, SBI and PNI) by implementing explicit filtering.
* generate prefix lists from the AS-Macro AS-AZION, registered at RADB and TC.
* ensure a high quality of experience for the end user with a minimum of 2 10G SFP+ interfaces and ensure that appropriate capacity upgrades occur in a timely manner.
