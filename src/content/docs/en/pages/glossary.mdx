This glossary introduces Azion's key concepts and terminology.

### Edge computing

Type of distributed computing system used to run applications on servers closer to users and devices, unlike centralized cloud servers. As it processes data near where it's generated, applications' speed, security, scalability, and availability dramatically increase. The edge itself is the network space where the edge servers are located. In many  cases, it ends where the last mile network meets the public Internet.

---

### Edge-native platform

 A type of technology solution designed to optimize delivery of content and applications at the edge of the network. It's based on edge computing and it brings data closer to the end-users, rather than relying solely on centralized data centers.

---

### Full-stack platform

A full-stack platform offers a comprehensive set of tools, libraries, and technologies for building and managing applications, end-to-end. It aims to accelerate and simplify the deployment and development in general, with easy-to-use interfaces and taking care of all the business logic, workflows, and backend.

---

### Bandwidth

Amount of information being received every second. At Azion, it represents the content that was delivered by your application every second.

---

### Product

tangible or intangible offering that satisfies a customer need or solves a problem. It can be a physical item, a software application, a service, or a combination of these.

---

### Module

part of a system or application that carries out a specific function or set of functions independently. This term is associated with modular design, which is a design approach that subdivides a system into smaller parts (modules) that can be independently created, maintained, updated, and replaced.

---

### Feature

specific function or characteristic of a product that makes it more attractive or useful to customers. Features are often what differentiate one product from another and can be a major selling point. For example, in a smartphone, features might include the quality of the camera, the size of the screen, or the speed of the processor.

---

### Client-server architecture

model in which the workload and responsibilities of a system are divided between two types of entities: clients and servers. In this architecture, clients are the end-user devices or applications that request services or resources from servers. Servers, on the other hand, are the centralized systems that provide these services or resources to the clients.

---

### Computational offloading

process of transferring computational tasks from a local device or server to a remote resource, such as an edge server or cloud server. This offloading can help alleviate the computational burden on the local device and improve performance by leveraging the resources and capabilities of the remote resource.

---

### Workloads

amount of work that is assigned to or performed by a system, application, or infrastructure. It can include tasks, processes, or operations that need to be executed within a specific timeframe. In the context of cloud computing, workloads often refer to the applications, services, or processes that run on virtual machines or containers within a cloud environment.

---

### Data center

centralized facility where organizations store, manage, and distribute their data and information. It is a physical location that houses a large number of servers, storage systems, networking equipment, and other infrastructure components. Data centers are designed to provide a secure and controlled environment for data storage and processing, with features such as redundant power supplies, cooling systems, fire suppression, and physical security measures.

---

### Throughput

With real-time data, organizations can gain a more accurate and current understanding of their operations, enabling them to respond quickly to changes, identify issues, and make informed decisions in a timely manner.

---

### Edge gateways

resources that facilitate communication between devices at the edge and distant servers or cloud services, if necessary. They act as a bridge between the edge network and the cloud, allowing devices at the edge to access information that may not be stored locally or to retrieve data from the original source when the edge node's cache has been cleared.

---

### Legacy / Static / Dynamic / Multi-purpose CDN



---

### Low-level programming languages

languages that are closer to the hardware and provide more control over the computer's resources. These languages are typically used for tasks that require direct manipulation of computer hardware, such as device drivers, operating systems, and embedded systems. Examples of low-level programming languages include Assembly language, which is specific to a particular computer architecture, and C, which is a more portable low-level language.

---

### Web Application Firewall (WAF)

security measure that protects applications from various threats such as SQL injections, Remote File Inclusion (RFI), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and other web vulnerabilities. It works by analyzing HTTP and HTTPS requests, detecting and blocking malicious activity before it reaches the application infrastructure. The WAF operates at the application layer (layer 7) and uses a set of rules to filter and monitor traffic between the application and the internet. 

---

### Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)

attack is a type of cybercrime that aims to disrupt the availability of a website, network, or application by overwhelming it with a massive amount of traffic from various sources. These attacks are carried out by infecting devices with malware, forming botnets that can be controlled remotely by the attackers. The infected devices then generate a high volume of traffic that floods the target, causing it to become unresponsive or unavailable to legitimate users. DDoS attacks can be categorized into different types, including TCP Connection Attacks, Volumetric Attacks, Fragmentation Attacks, and Application Attacks. 

---

### Web Application and API Protection (WAAP)

measures and strategies implemented to safeguard web applications and APIs from various security threats and attacks. These protections are crucial to ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the applications and the data they handle.

---

### Middleware applications

software programs that act as a bridge between different systems or components in a distributed computing environment. They provide a layer of abstraction and enable communication and integration between different software applications or components. Middleware applications are designed to handle specific tasks such as data transformation, message routing, security, and transaction management.

### HTTP headers

part of the HTTP protocol and are used to transmit additional information between the client and the server. They are included in the request and response messages and provide instructions or metadata about the request or response. used for various purposes, such as controlling caching behavior, authentication, content negotiation, and more. Some commonly used HTTP headers include:

Content-Type: Specifies the media type of the resource being sent or requested, such as text/html or application/json.
Content-Length: Indicates the length of the content in bytes.
Cache-Control: Controls caching behavior, such as whether a response can be cached and for how long.

Set-Cookie: Sets a cookie on the client's browser for session management or other purposes.

---

### Proxy

server or a software application that acts as an intermediary between a client and a server. It allows clients to make indirect network connections to other network services through the proxy server. The proxy server receives the client's request and forwards it to the appropriate server. The server then sends the response back to the proxy, which in turn sends it to the client.

---

### Reverse proxy

server that acts as an intermediary between clients and servers. It receives requests from clients and forwards them to the appropriate server to retrieve the requested resources. The reverse proxy hides the identity and characteristics of the servers behind it, providing an extra layer of security and load balancing. It can also cache and optimize content to improve performance.

---

### HTTP Status

response codes that a server sends to a client in response to an HTTP request. These status codes indicate the success or failure of the request and provide information about the specific nature of the response. The HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers grouped into different categories:

1xx - Informational responses: These codes indicate that the request has been received and the server is continuing to process it.

2xx - Success responses: These codes indicate that the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted by the server.

3xx - Redirection responses: These codes indicate that further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request, such as redirecting the client to a different URL.

4xx - Client error responses: These codes indicate that there was an error in the client's request, such as a missing parameter or an invalid request.

5xx - Server error responses: These codes indicate that there was an error on the server side, preventing the request from being fulfilled.

---

### Origin
