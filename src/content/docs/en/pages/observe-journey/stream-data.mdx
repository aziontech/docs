**Data Stream** allows you to stream your logs from Azion applications to stream processing, SIEM, and big data platforms. All logs are based on events related to products connected to your edge applications.

Through connectors, you can configure a stream to automatically stream your logs. This will allow you to have an organized set of logs in the analysis platform of your choice and analyze the performance of your content and applications.

To start generating logs and configure them in a stream:

- [Build an edge application](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/build-an-application/): create an edge application and, optionally, configure domains and modules, in addition to edge functions.
- [Secure an edge application with WAF](/en/documentation/products/secure/secure-application/): use Edge Firewall and the Web Application Firewall (WAF) module to protect your applications against threats.
- [Configure a stream](/en/documentation/products/guides/use-data-stream/): create and configure a stream and [choose variables](/en/documentation/products/guides/observe/data-stream-select-variables/) to stream your data to other platforms.
