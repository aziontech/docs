Your analysis using **Real-Time Metrics** depends on the [product you choose](/en/documentation/products/observe/real-time-metrics/#product-choice-to-view-metrics) to use and its available fields. Each product has specific fields that generate the charts providing information on access, behavior, and performance of your applications and related products.

Once you've chosen a product to view charts and conduct an analysis, you can:

- Add filters.
- Choose a data interval.
- Use the **Get help** tags to learn more about each chart.

Real-Time Metrics provides a standard view with graphs exhibiting pre-defined fields, but you can add filters to view more specific data.

To analyse metrics:

1. Navigate through the page to see all available charts.
2. Hover over the points of the charts to view the specific data and time range.
3. Zoom in and out on the chart by scrolling up and down.
4. Use the **Context menu** to copy the chart's query, export the points in a `.CSV` file, enable the chart's mean line, or enable the chart's mean lines per series.
5. Take a look at the **Variation tag** to see how your data is behaving relative to the previous corresponding data interval.
6. Copy the URL path to share the filters you've applied with other Azion users.
