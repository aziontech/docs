## Customizing a dashboard on Grafana

After [installing a Grafana instance locally](https://github.com/aziontech/grafana-plugin/blob/dev/README.md#install-azion-plugin-on-local-grafana-install-locally) on your machine and authorizing the Azion plugin, open it.

Follow the next steps:

1. On the left-side menu, click on **Dashboards**. The dashboard page opens.
2. Next to the search bar, click **New** > **New Dashboard**.
3. On the **Add panel** card, select **Add a new panel**.
4. On the second section of the page, below the preview, on **Data source** dropdown menu, select **Azion**.
5. On the code box, add the query you want to use.
    - See the [GraphQL API guides](/en/documentation/devtools/graphql-api/overview/) for a few examples of queries.

The five fields below can be used to complete your setup depending on what type of visualization you're using and what you want to see on your graphs:

- **Data path**: add the value **Metrics**.
- **Time path**: inform a timestamp. The field is dot-delimited.
- **Time format**: inform a time format in [moment.js format](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/string/).
- **Group by**: use the field you want to use to group your data aggregation.
- **Alias by**: use to change the value and name of a field shown in the legend.

6. On the right side of the page, on the **Visualization** list, select the visualization type you want to use. Example: **Time series**.
7. On the upper-right corner, click **Save** to apply your configurations.
