**Real-Time Metrics** allows you to monitor your applications in real time. Metrics are exhibited through charts that provide information related to access, behavior, and performance of products connected to your applications.

Once your applications begin receiving traffic, you'll be able to visualize data through Real-Time Metrics.

To start generating data and visualize your metrics:

- [Build an application](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/build-an-application/): create an application and, optionally, configure domains and modules, in addition to functions.
- [Secure an application with WAF](/en/documentation/products/secure/secure-application/): use Firewall and the Web Application Firewall (WAF) module to protect your applications against threats.
- [Secure your DNS](/en/documentation/products/secure/secure-dns/): create a zone and host your domains directly on Azion.
- [Configure a streaming](/en/documentation/products/guides/use-data-stream/): create and configure a streaming and [choose variables](/en/documentation/products/guides/observe/data-stream-select-variables/) to stream your data to other platforms.
- [Analyze metrics](/en/documentation/products/guides/observe/analyze-metrics/): after creating your application and configuring other products, understand how to analyze the metrics exhibited on Real-Time Metrics.
- [Add filters](/en/documentation/products/guides/observe/add-filters-metrics/): set filters to query more accurate results in your data visualization on Real-Time Metrics.
