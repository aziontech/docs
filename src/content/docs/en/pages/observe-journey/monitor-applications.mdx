**Real-Time Metrics** allows you to monitor your applications in real time. Metrics are exhibited through charts that provide information related to access, behavior, and performance of products connected to your edge applications.

Once your applications begin receiving traffic, you'll be able to visualize data through Real-Time Metrics.

<Button href="/en/documentation/products/observe/real-time-metrics/" text="go to data streaming reference" variant="secondary" target="_blank"></Button>

To start generating data and visualize your metrics:

- [Build an edge application](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/build-an-application/): create an edge application and, optionally, configure domains and modules, in addition to edge functions.
- [Secure an edge application with WAF](/en/documentation/products/secure/secure-application/): use Edge Firewall and the Web Application Firewall (WAF) module to protect your applications against threats.
- [Secure your DNS](/en/documentation/products/secure/secure-dns/): create a zone and host your domains directly on Azion.
- [Configure a streaming](/en/documentation/products/guides/use-data-streaming/): create and configure a streaming and [choose variables](/en/documentation/products/guides/observe/data-streaming-select-variables/) to stream your data to other platforms.
- [Analyze metrics](/en/documentation/products/guides/observe/analyze-metrics/): after creating your edge application and configuring other products, understand how to analyze the metrics exhibited on Real-Time Metrics.
- [Add filters](/en/documentation/products/guides/observe/add-filters-metrics/): set filters to query more accurate results in your data visualization on Real-Time Metrics.
