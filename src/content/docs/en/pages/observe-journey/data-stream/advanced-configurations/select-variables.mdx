The data streamed by **Data Stream** to your configured connectors is decided according to the variables you choose to use. Each variable provides a specific information or set of information and is associated with a specific data source.

You can find all available variables, their descriptions, and examples in the [data source](/en/documentation/products/observe/data-stream/#data-sources) reference.

You have the option of using a [pre-set template](using-a-pre-set-template), with an option for each available data source, or using a [custom template](using-a-custom-template), so you can decide which variables will be streamed.

## Using a pre-set template

If you're configuring a connector to receive as much information as possible from, for example, an edge application, using a pre-set template could be the best choice. In this case, you'll use the **Edge Applications + WAF Event Collector** template via Azion Console or the **http** template via API.

## Using a custom template

If you're configuring a connector with a specific purpose, such as, for example, analyzing logs related to the status of your edge application, you can configure a **Custom Template** via Azion Console or a **temaplate_model** via API. Creating a customizable template allows you to choose from the [list of available variables](/en/documentation/products/observe/data-stream/#data-sources) the ones you want to use.

In this case, you could use, for example, the variables `$status`, `$proxy_status`, and `$upstream_status`. You'll also be able to edit the streaming and add new variables if you find they aren't providing all the information you require.
