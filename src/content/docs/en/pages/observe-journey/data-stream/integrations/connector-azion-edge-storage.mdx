While configuring [streams](/en/documentation/products/guides/use-data-stream/), you need to set up a specific endpoint to stream your Azion data.

Continue reading for a step-by-step guide on configuring an [Azion Edge Storage](/en/documentation/products/store/edge-storage/) connector to receive data from Data Stream.

## Requirements

- Create an [S3 credential via API](/en/documentation/products/store/storage/s3-protocol-for-edge-storage/#create-a-credential-via-api) and [configure access to the bucket through s3cmd](/en/documentation/products/store/storage/s3-protocol-for-edge-storage/#configure-access-to-the-bucket-through-s3cmd).
  - Save the **Access Key** and **Secret Key** linked to your credential. You'll need them later.
- Create an [Edge Storage bucket](/en/documentation/products/store/storage/create-bucket/), or use an existing one.

## Configuring the connector in Data Stream

Next, follow these steps to configure the new connector in your Azion **Data Stream**.

You can find detailed steps for the entire configuration in the [How to use Data Stream guide](/en/documentation/products/guides/use-data-stream/).

:::note
All `key` fields will be masked and an icon that allows revealing the field content will be only displayed to users with the `Edit Data Stream` permission. Users without the `Edit Data Stream` permission can only view the settings of the existing stream but not edit or create new ones.
:::

1. On the **Connector** dropdown menu, select **Simple Storage Service (S3)**.
2. On **URL**, add the URL of the Azion Edge Storage S3 Host. Example: `s3.us-east-005.azionstorage.net`.
3. On **Bucket Name**, add the name of your S3 bucket on Edge Storage. Example: `mys3bucket`.
4. On **Region**, add the region configured on Edge Storage. Example: `us-east-005`.
5. On **Access Key**, add the access key you created on Edge Storage. Example: `ORIA5ZEH9MW4NL5OITY4`.
6. On **Secret Key**, add the secret key you created on Edge Storage. Example: `+PLjkUWJyOLth3anuWXcLLVrMLeiiiThIokaPEiw`.
7. On **Object Key Prefix** (optional), add the prefix name of your uploaded object.
  - The objects' names are composed of *Prefix* + *Timestamp* + *UUID*.
  - Example: if you use *waf_logs* as the prefix, one of the sent objects will be saved as `waf_logs_1622575860091_37d66e78-c308-4006-9d4d-1c013ed89276`
8. On **Content Type**, add the format of the object that'll be created in your S3 bucket. It can be `plain/text` or `application/gzip`.
9. Make sure the **Active** switch is on.
10. Click the **Save** button.

After saving the configurations, your data will be streamed to the newly configured endpoint.

You can keep track of the calls made by Data Stream to Edge Storage in [Real-Time Events](/en/documentation/products/observe/real-time-events/). To do so, select **Data Source** > **Data Stream** and choose the filter options as you wish.
