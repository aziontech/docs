Once you [create a stream](/en/documentation/products/guides/use-data-stream/), you can also use other [Observe](/en/documentation/products/observe/) products to monitor how Data Stream is processing and sending requests to the configured connector.

- [Real-Time Metrics](/en/documentation/products/observe/real-time-metrics/): access to charts with aggregated data to explore behaviors throughout longer periods of data storage.
- [GraphQL API](/en/documentation/devtools/graphql-api/overview/): access to aggragated and raw data via API with customized queries with only the data you request.
- [Real-Time Events](/en/documentation/products/observe/real-time-events/): access to logs with raw data to perform extensive analysis.
