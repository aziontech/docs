While configuring [data streamings](/en/documentation/products/data-streaming/), you need to set up a specific endpoint to stream your Azion data.

Continue reading for a step by step on how to connect an [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/) endpoint to receive data from Data Streaming.

## Elasticsearch requirements

You can run an **Elasticsearch** instance on any cloud computing platform. To set it up, look for the specific documentation for your chosen platform.

For the next steps, you'll use the **Elasticsearch cloud**. Follow the next steps to continue your **Elasticsearch Cloud** configuration:

1. Create an account at [Elasticsearch Cloud](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/).
2. Access your [cloud account](https://cloud.elastic.co/home).
3. [Create a deployment](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud/current/ec-create-deployment.html). This process takes about five minutes.
4. To create a deploy, you have to provide the following information:

    - A name.
    - A cloud provider.
    - A region for your cloud.
    - A hardware profile.
    - The version you’ll use.
    - Optionally, you can configure **advanced settings**.


5. Click the **Create deployment** button. The creation process takes about five minutes.
6. Go to [your dashboard](https://cloud.elastic.co/home) on Elastic Cloud. You'll see the created deployment with the name you’ve chosen.
7. Click on the gear on the right corner of the deploy to access the configuration page for the deployment.
8. Under **Applications**, click **Copy endpoint** according to the endpoint you want to use to get your URL.
9. On the left menu, click **API console** > create an API key following the [Elasticsearch instructions](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/master/security-api-create-api-key.html).

## Configuring the endpoint in Data Streaming

Next, follow these steps to configure the new endpoint you created in **Elasticsearch** in your Azion **Data Streaming**.

You can find detailed steps for the entire configuration on the [How to use Data Streaming guide](/en/documentation/products/guides/use-data-streaming/).

In the **Destination** configurations:

1. On the **Endpoint Type** dropdown menu, select **Elasticsearch**.
2. On **Elasticsearch URL**, add the URL of your endpoint you copied on Elasticsearch. Example: https://my-deploy-pg4by0.es.us-central1.gcp.cloud.es.io
3. On **API Key**, add the API Key you created in Elasticsearch. Example: SetGAmr_TzdYTHXfXKoSjL
4. Make sure the **Active** switch is on.
5. Click the **Save** button.

After saving the configurations, your data will be streamed to the newly configured endpoint.

You can keep track of the calls made by Data Streaming to Elasticsearch on [Real-Time Events](/en/documentation/products/real-time-events/). To do so, select **Data Source** > **Data Streaming** and choose the filters options as you wish.
