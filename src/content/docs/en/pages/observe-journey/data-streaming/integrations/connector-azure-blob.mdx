While configuring [data streamings](/en/documentation/products/data-streaming/), you need to set up a specific endpoint to stream your Azion data.

Continue reading for a step by step on how to connect an [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/blobs) endpoint to receive data from Data Streaming.

## Azure Blob Storage requirements

To get started with Microsoftâ€™s **Azure Blob Storage**, you must follow a few steps:

1. Create [a Microsoft Data Storage](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.StorageAccount) account.
2. Create [a container](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-container-create) for your Blob Storage.
3. Create [a SAS Token](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview) to your Blob Storage with the permission to create, read, write, and list.

> For more information on how to create an Azure Storage Account, you can see the Azure Storage [documentation page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/).

## Configuring the endpoint in Data Streaming

Next, follow these steps to configure the new endpoint you created in **Azure Blob Storage** in your Azion **Data Streaming**.

You can find detailed steps for the entire configuration on the [How to use Data Streaming guide](/en/documentation/products/guides/use-data-streaming/).

In the **Destination** configurations:

1. On the **Endpoint Type** dropdown menu, select **Azure Blob Storage**.
2. On **Storage Account**, add the name of your storage account of your Azure Blob Storage. Example: `mystorageaccount`
3. On **Container Name**, add the name of your Azure Blob Storage container. Example: `log_container`
4. On **Blob SAS Token**, add the Blob SAS token of your Azure Blob Storage. Example: `fd56e23e1f12efe`
5. Make sure the **Active** switch is on.
6. Click the **Save** button.

After saving the configurations, your data will be streamed to the newly configured endpoint.

You can keep track of the calls made by Data Streaming to Azure Blob on [Real-Time Events](/en/documentation/products/real-time-events/). To do so, select **Data Source** > **Data Streaming** and choose the filters options as you wish.
