While configuring [data streamings](/en/documentation/products/guides/use-data-streaming/), you need to set up a specific endpoint to stream your Azion data.

You can use the **Standard HTTP/HTTPS POST** option to configure a streaming with a third-party platform that isn't available as a Data Streaming connector that can receive data via HTTP or HTTPS POST requests.

---

## Configuring the endpoint in Data Streaming

### Via RTM

You can find detailed steps for the entire configuration on the [How to configure Data Streaming main settings](/en/documentation/products/guides/use-data-streaming/) guide.

Follow the next steps to configure your Azion **Data Streaming** endpoint.

In the **Destination** configurations:

1. On the **Endpoint Type** dropdown menu, select **Standard HTTP/HTTPS POST**.
2. On **Endpoint URL**, add the URL of the platform that'll receive the data. Example: `http://myhost.com`
3. On **Custom Headers** (*optional*), you can provide additional data the third-party platform accepts or requires, such as an access key.
    - You can pass up to *5 headers*.
4. Click the **Save** button.

After saving the configurations, your data will be streamed to the newly configured endpoint.

:::tip
With this type of connector, you can also [set up a payload](/en/documentation/products/guides/observe/data-streaming-set-payload/).
:::

You can keep track of the calls made by Data Streaming to Datadog on [Real-Time Events](/en/documentation/products/real-time-events/). To do so, select **Data Source** > **Data Streaming** and choose the filters options as you wish.

### Via API

1. Run the following `GET` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) to retrieve your `<data_streaming_id>`:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/data_streaming/streamings' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "name": "HTTPS connector",
    "template_id": 2,
    "domain_ids": [1656613172],
    "endpoint": {
        "endpoint_type": "standard",
        "url": "http://myhost.com",
        "payload_format": "$dataset",
        "log_line_separator": "\n",
        "max_size": 1000024,
        "headers":{
            "access-key": "Ph7EK3b7UD2hba6"
        }
    }
}'
```

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | Name of the streaming |
| `template_id` | Identifier for the template being used |
| `domain_ids` | Array value of the domain's identifiers (integers) you want to associate with the streaming |
| `endpoint` | Endpoint to which you want to stream your data |

2. You'll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
  "results": {
    "id": 1595,
    "name": "HTTPS connector",
    "template_id": 2,
    "data_source": "http",
    "active": true,
    "endpoint": {
      "endpoint_type": "standard",
      "url": "http://myhost.com",
      "log_line_separator": "\n",
      "payload_format": "$dataset",
      "max_size": 1000024,
      "headers": {
        "access-key": "Ph7EK3b7UD2hba6",
      }
    },
    "all_domains": false
  },
  "schema_version": 3
}
```

Wait a few minutes for the changes to propagate and your streaming will be updated.

Check the [Azion API documentation](https://api.azion.com/) and the [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/aziontech/azionapi-openapi/) to know more about what the Azion API can offer.
