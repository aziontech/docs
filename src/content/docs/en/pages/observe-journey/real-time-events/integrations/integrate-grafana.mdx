The Azion data source plugin on Grafana allows you to visualize the data from your existing applications on Azion on a Grafana dashboard with charts and tables. It queries data from [Real-Time Metrics](/en/documentation/products/real-time-metrics/) and [Real-Time Events](/en/documentation/products/observe/real-time-events/), which use the [GraphQL APIs](/en/documentation/products/graphql-api-overview).

---

## Requirements

To use the Azion data source plugin, you need:

- An [Azion account](https://manager.azion.com/signup).
- A [personal token](/en/documentation/products/accounts/personal-tokens/) to authenticate your account.
- One or more [edge applications](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/) created on your account.
- [Access to Grafana](https://grafana.com/).

---

## Installing the plugin on Grafana

Currently, to use the Azion data source plugin, you must install it locally and enable your account to use unsigned plugins. See the documentation on [the plugin's GitHub repository](https://github.com/aziontech/grafana-plugin/blob/dev/README.md#install-azion-plugin-on-local-grafana-install-locally) for a step-by-step on how to install it.

:::note
Azion focuses on an on-premise approach. This plugin is only available with local instances.
