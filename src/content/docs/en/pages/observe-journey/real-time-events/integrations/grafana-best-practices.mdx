The Azion data source plugin on Grafana allows you to customize dashboards with your Azion data.

While using Grafana, there are a few best practices you can rely on:

- To use a time series graph, you must inform a timestamp on the **Time path** field. It must be used in `ISO8601` format or a configurable custom format.
- To aggregate data into multiple data points, you must use the **Group by** field. To use a time series graph, you must use this field.
- Nested objects are flattened with underscores.
- While using Grafana variables, replace them directly in the query's field.
- To configure or change a name of a field shown in the legend, use the **Alias by** field: substitute `$field_<field.name>` with the values for the field; substitute `$fieldName` with a name for the field.
- [Use annotations](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/build-dashboards/annotate-visualizations/) to mark points on a graph.
- Use the dashboard's [time range](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/use-dashboards/#time-units-and-relative-ranges) to explore and analyze your data.
