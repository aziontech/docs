:::caution[important]
Azion has two user interfaces: Real-Time Manager and Console, which is in *Preview* stage. Currently, Console is only available for Developer plans and new accounts. This guide provides steps for the Real-Time Manager user interface.

**Real-Time Events** allows you to filter your analysis with the specific variables and type of data you want to receive.

Once you [understand Real-Time Events logs](/en/documentation/products/guides/observe/understand-logs/) and decide the variables you want to query, you can use the filter and query for more accurate results.

If you run a query with a blank **Filter by** field, you’ll get all existing records for the variables of the selected data source available during the selected time filter.

The **Filter by** field uses SQL language to query results. Your search must be in one of two formats:

`key='value'`

- Exact match, where:
    - `key`: one of the variables from the data source you're querying for.
    - `=`: means the search must query for the exact value passed.
    - `value`: a value of either string or integer format.

`key like '%value%'`

- Similar value, where:
    - `key`: one of the variables from the data source you're querying for.
    - `like`: means the search must query for a similar value to the one passed.
    - `%value%`: a value of either string or integer format surrounded.

In the second format, you can use with `value`:

    - `%value%`: filters for values that contain the entire specified value.
    - `%value`: filters for values that end with the specified value. 
    - `value%`: filters for values that begin with the specified value.

You can also search for more complex queries with the `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` notations to combine the fields.

As you're querying for a variable and a value, it's important to undertsand the available variables and the [type of values it can accept](/en/documentation/products/observe/real-time-events/#data-sources).

Some examples of SQL queries:

| Variable | SQL query |
| -------- | --------- |
| $status | `status='404'` |
| $status + $scheme | `status='200' AND scheme='https'` |
| $endpoint_type | `endpoint_type='datadog'` |
| $geoloc_country_name | `geoloc_country_name='Brazil'` |
| $message_content | `message_content like '%unavailable%'` |
| $message_content | `message_content like '%available%'` |

:::note
You can't use the `timestamp` variable as a key in your search, as you'll query the time in the **Time filter** field.
