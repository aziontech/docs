import Button from 'azion-webkit/components/Button';


If you use [Edge Pulse](/en/documentation/products/observe/edge-pulse/) to collect navigation data by adding one of the available **Edge Pulse JavaScript tags** in your pages, you can analyze the collected data on **Real-Time Events**.

## Querying on Real-Time Events

[Real-Time Events](/en/documentation/products/observe/analyze-logs/) provides the **Edge Pulse** data source. By querying it, you can conduct a detailed analysis of the raw logs collected by the added tags.

The categories for collected data are:

- Navigation
- Performance
- User experience
- Informational
- Network

With the analysis, you can improve your content and user experience.
