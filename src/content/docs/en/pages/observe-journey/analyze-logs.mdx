**Real-Time Events** allows you to query and analyze raw logs in real time. Each data source exhibits detailed information for logs from events related to access, behavior, and performance of products connected to your applications.

Once your applications begin receiving traffic, you'll be able to diagnose data through Real-Time Events.

<Button href="/en/documentation/products/observe/real-time-events/" label="go to real-time events reference" type="primary" theme="light" target="_blank" />

To start generating data and diagnose your logs:

- [Build an application](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/build-an-application/): create an application and, optionally, configure domains and modules, in addition to functions.
- [Secure an application with WAF](/en/documentation/products/secure/secure-application/): use Firewall and the Web Application Firewall (WAF) module to protect your applications against threats.
- [Configure a stream](/en/documentation/products/guides/use-data-stream/): create and configure a stream and [choose variables](/en/documentation/products/guides/observe/data-stream-select-variables/) to stream your data to other platforms.
- [Collect navigation data](/en/documentation/products/guides/observe/analyze-navigation-data/): use Edge Pulse to collect navigation data through your browser pages.
- [Understand logs](/en/documentation/products/guides/observe/understand-logs/): after creating your application and configuring other products, understand how to analyze the logs exhibited on Real-Time Events.
- [Add filters](/en/documentation/products/guides/observe/add-filters-events/): set filters to query more accurate results in your log inspection on Real-Time Events.
