The Okta Identity Provider (IdP) is a trusted entity that allows you to enable single sign-on to access other sites or services, such as Azion. Your users can continue using their corporate user identities without having to remember a specific password or enter credentials each time they access **Real-Time Manager (RTM)**. 

:::caution[warning]
Even if you're using an IdP, it’s necessary to register all users of the account on RTM as they are synced in both RTM and IdP. An inexistent user on RTM won’t be able to log in to it.
:::

When using an IdP, you have two protocol possibilities: Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) and OpenID Connect (OIDC).

To set up an Okta custom SAML app as your account IdP for RTM, follow the next steps.
