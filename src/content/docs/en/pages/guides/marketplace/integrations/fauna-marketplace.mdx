Fauna is a flexible, developer-friendly, transactional database that comes as a secure and scalable cloud API with native GraphQL. It integrates seamlessly into the *serverless* ecosystem.

## Requirements

To use the Fauna integration, you must:

1. Create a [Fauna account](https://dashboard.fauna.com/accounts/register).
2. Generate a Fauna API key. 
    - To do so, go to your Fauna dashboard and select **Security** on the side bar. Then, generate an API key by clicking on the **New Key** button, give it a name, and click the **Save** button.
    - Take note of your API key because you can't retrieve this key later. If you lose the key, you'll have to revoke the old key and create a new one.
3. Have an existent edge application on Azion.

:::tip
If you don't have an edge application yet, go to the [building section](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/build-an-application/) for more details on how to build one.

## Instantiating the integration

Still on the **Edge Application** page:

<Tabs client:visible>
    <Fragment slot="tab.console">Console</Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.rtm">Real-Time Manager</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.console">
1. Select the **Functions Instances** tab.
2. Click the **+ Function Instance** button.
3. Choose an easy to remember name for your function.
4. On the dropdown function menu, select the **Fauna** function.

This action will load the **Arguments** tab, where you can add the parameters to execute your application.

This function works without configuration on the **Args** tab. The JSON Args for this function are parametrizable through the request headers: `x-secret` (the key you got on Fauna dashboard) and `x-db-name` (name of the database you're going to create on Fauna).

5. When you're ready, click the **Save** button.

You'll receive a successful message indicating your function was saved.
