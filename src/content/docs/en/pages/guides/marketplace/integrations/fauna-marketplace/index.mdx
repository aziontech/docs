Fauna is a flexible, developer-friendly, transactional database that comes as a secure and scalable cloud API with native GraphQL. It integrates seamlessly into the *serverless* ecosystem.

---

## Getting the solution

The Fauna solution is a *serverless* solution available at **Azion Marketplace**.

To use the Fauna solution, you have to:

1. Log in to [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com).
    - If you don’t have one yet, create an account [visiting the sign-up page](https://manager.azion.com/signup/).
2. On the upper-left corner of the page, select **Products menu** > **Marketplace**.
3. Select the search box and type “*fauna*” or browse through the cards to find the Fauna solution.
4. Once you’ve found the Fauna card, select it to go to the solution page.
5. On the solution page, look for the **Subscribe for** section on the bottom-right corner and click the **Get It Now** button.

> You’ll see a message indicating that your solution was successfully installed and is ready to use.

## Creating an account at Fauna

To use the Fauna solution, you'll need to have an API key. To get it, you have to register at Fauna.

To do so, follow the steps:

1. Go to Fauna website registration to [create an account](https://dashboard.fauna.com/accounts/register).
2. After you've created your account, go to your dashboard and select **Security** on the side bar.
3. On the security page, generate an API key by clicking on the **New Key** button.
    - Take note of your API key because you can't retrieve this key later. If you lose the key, you'll have to revoke the old key and create a new one.
4. Give an easy to remember name to your key and click the **Save** button.
5. After clicking the **Save** button, you'll see a message showing your secret key.

Done. Now that you have a secret key, you can instantiate your Fauna solution at Azion.

## Using the solution

Once you’ve gotten your solution on **Marketplace**, it’ll be available at your edge functions list. To use the solution, you’ll have to create a new edge application.

To create an edge application you have three options:

- By visiting the documentation on [getting started](/en/documentation/products/getting-started/). 
- Through **RTM**. On the upper-left corner of the page, select **Products menu** > **Edge Application** and follow the instructions.
- Using an already existing edge application.

## Configuring the solution

To configure your solution, proceed as follows:

1. On the upper-left corner, select **Products menu** > **Edge Applications** on the **BUILD** section.
2. On the listing page of your edge applications, select the one you want to use with the Fauna solution.
3. On the application page, on the **Main Settings** tab, locate the **Edge Functions** switch and turn it on to enable functions on your edge application.
4. Click the **Save** button.

> You’ll receive a successful message indicating you have updated your edge application.

## Instantiating the solution

To enable this function, while still on the **Edge Application** page:

1. Select the **Functions** tab on the top list.
2. Click the **Add Function** button.
3. Choose an easy to remember name for your function.
4. On the function dropdown menu, select the **Fauna** function.

This action will load the function, showing a form with the solution source code and, just above it, two tabs: **Code** and **Args**. By clicking the Code tab you will be able to navigate through the code, but won't be able to change it.

This function works without configuration on the **Args** tab. The JSON Args for this function are parametrizable through the request headers: `x-secret` (the key you got on Fauna dashboard) and `x-db-name` (name of the database you're going to create on Fauna).

## Configuring a rule on Rules Engine

Still in the **Edge Application** page, in the **Rules Engine** tab, you have to configure the rules you want (*criteria* and *behavior*) to apply to run your function.

To do so, follow these steps:

1. Select the **Rules Engine** tab.
2. Click on **Default Rule**.
    - **Note**: you can’t change the *criteria* field for the **Default Rule** on **Rules Engine**.
3. On the *behavior* field, select **Run Function** from the dropdown menu and then select the Fauna function, according to the name you gave it in the instantiation step.
4. Click the **Save** button.
