Fauna is a flexible, developer-friendly, transactional database that comes as a secure and scalable cloud API with native GraphQL. It integrates seamlessly into the *serverless* ecosystem.

---

## Requirements

To use the Fauna integration, you must:

1. Create a [Fauna account](https://dashboard.fauna.com/accounts/register).
2. Generate a Fauna API key. 
    - To do so, go to your Fauna dashboard and select **Security** on the side bar. Then, generate an API key by clicking on the **New Key** button, give it a name, and click the **Save** button.
    - Take note of your API key because you can't retrieve this key later. If you lose the key, you'll have to revoke the old key and create a new one.
3. Have an existent edge application on Azion.

:::tip
If you don't have an edge application yet, go to the [building section](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/build-an-application/) for more details on how to build one.

## Getting the integration

To install it:

1. Access [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/) > **Marketplace**.
2. On the Marketplace homepage, select the integration's card.
3. Once the integration's page opens, click the **Get It Now** button, at the bottom-right corner of the page.

A successful message appears to confirm your integration is installed.

:::tip
You can search any integration by browsing through the cards or typing a keyword in the search bar.

## Configuring the integration

To configure your integration, proceed as follows:

1. On the upper-left corner, open the **Products menu** > select **Edge Applications** on the **BUILD** section.
2. On the listing page of your edge applications, select the one you want to use with the Fauna integration.
3. On the application page, open the **Main Settings** tab.
4. Enable the **Edge Functions** switch to activate this module on your edge application.
5. Click the **Save** button.

You'll receive a successful message indicating you've updated your edge application.

:::caution[warning]
If a product or module is activated, it could generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/) for more information.

## Instantiating the integration

Still on the **Edge Application** page:

1. Select the **Functions** tab.
2. Click the **Add Function** button.
3. Choose an easy to remember name for your function.
4. On the function dropdown menu, select the **Fauna** function.

This action will load the function, showing a form with the integration source code and, just above it, two tabs: **Code** and **Args**. By clicking the Code tab you'll be able to navigate through the code, but won't be able to change it.

This function works without configuration on the **Args** tab. The JSON Args for this function are parametrizable through the request headers: `x-secret` (the key you got on Fauna dashboard) and `x-db-name` (name of the database you're going to create on Fauna).

5. When you're ready, click the **Save** button.

You'll receive a successful message indicating your function was saved.

## Configuring a rule on Rules Engine

Now you have to configure the rules you want (*criteria* and *behavior*) to apply to run your function.

Still on the **Edge Application** page, follow these steps:

1. Select the **Rules Engine** tab.
2. Click on **Default Rule**.
    - You can't change the *criteria* field for the **Default Rule** on **Rules Engine**.
3. On the *behavior* field, select **Run Function** from the dropdown menu and then select the Fauna function, according to the name you gave it in the instantiation step.
4. Click the **Save** button.

You'll receive a successful message indicating you've updated your edge application.
