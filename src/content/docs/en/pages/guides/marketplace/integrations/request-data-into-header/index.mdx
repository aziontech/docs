The Process Request Data Into Header solution is a *serverless* solution available at Azion Marketplace. 

The purpose of this function is to stop a request whenever a request body field is empty. Using regex, the user can validate not only whether the field exists but also patterns. Additionally, they have the option to use any behavior they choose rather than a predetermined `Deny Request`.

1. On RTM, on the **Products menu**, select **Edge Firewall** in the **SECURE** section.
2. Click the **Add Rule Set** button.
3. Give an easy to remember name to your new rule.
4. Select the domains you want to protect with the function.
5. Turn the **Edge Functions** switch on.
6. Click the **Save** button.

Done. Now you have instantiated the rule for your function.

### Setting up the solution

To instantiate the **Process Request Data Into Header** solution, while still on the **Edge Firewall** page, select the **Functions** tab and follow these steps:

1. Click the **Add Function** button.
2. Give an easy to remember name to your instance.
3. On the dropdown menu, select the **Process Request Data Into Header** function.

This action will load the function, showing a form with the function's source code and, just above it, two tabs: **Code** and **Args**. By clicking the Code tab, you'll be able to navigate through the source code but won't be able to change it. Also, this function doesn't address any argument on the Args tab, but you can test it using the `curl` command.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `curl https://mydomain/function`                                                                                                                                            | `X-Body-Error": "CT001`                                                                              |
| `curl -H "Content-Type: application /x-www-form-urlencoded" --request POST --data 'param1=v1&param2=v2&param3=v3' https://mydomain/function`                                | `X-Body-Param1": "v1"` <br /> `X-Body-Param2": "v2"` <br /> `X-Body-Param3": "v3"`                                 |
| `curl -H "Content-Type: application /json" --request POST --data '{"my_data": {"abc": {"def": {"g": "xyz","h": false,"e": null}}, "number": 1}}' https://mydomain/function` | `X-Body-My-Data-Abc-Def-G": "xyz"` <br /> `X-Body-My-Data-Abc-Def-H": "false"` <br />`X-Body-My-Data-Number": "1"` |
| `curl -H "Content-Type: text /plain" --request POST --data 'plain=text' https://mydomain /function`                                                                         | `X-Body-Error": "CT002"`                                                                             |
| `curl -H "Content-Type: application /json" --request POST --data '{"my_data": {"abc": {"def": {"g": "xyz","h": false,"e": null}}, "number": 1}' https://mydomain/function`  | `X-Body-Error": "FD001"`                                                                             |

> **Important**: as long as the request has a valid `Content-Type` header and a valid request body, the solution converts the body fields into headers. This solution also supports nested object data; in this case, each "level" will be separated by a hyphen.

#### Possible errors

This solution can trigger errors; in this case, the errors will be appended to a new header called `X-Body-Error`.

| Error Code | Description                                                                    |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CT001`    | The header `Content-Type` is missing or it's null.                             |
| `CT002`    | The header `Content-Type` has a value, but it isn't supported by the function. |
| `FD001`    | The request body isn't correctly formatted and couldn't be decoded.          |

## Setting up the Edge Firewall Rules Engine

To finish, you have to set up the [Rules Engine](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/rules-engine/) to configure the *behavior* and the *criteria* to run the solution.

Still in the **Edge Firewall** page, select the **Rules Engine** tab and follow these steps:

1. Click the **New Rule** button.
2. Name your rule something easy to remember.
3. Select a *criteria* to run and catch the domain you want to run the solution on.
4. Below, select a *behavior* to the *criteria*. In this case, it’ll be **Run Function**. Then, select the adequate **Process Request Data Into Header** function, according to the name you gave it in the instantiate step.
5. Click the **Save** button.

Done. Now the Process Request Data Into Header solution is running for every request made to the domain you indicated.
