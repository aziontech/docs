<InterfaceNote />

The Azion **Add Request ID** integration enables you to add an additional header in the incoming request object, assigning a unique identifier to each HTTP request attended by Azion Edge Platform.

This identifier facilitates you in tracking and identifying individual requests, as well as allows you to analyze logs and identify issues. This way, you can cross-reference data from observability products, such as Azion Data Stream and Real-Time Events, with the internal logs of your infrastructure.

### Setting up the function

While still on the **Edge Firewall** page:

<Tabs client:visible>
    <Fragment slot="tab.console">Console</Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.rtm">Real-Time Manager</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.console">
1. Select the **Functions Instances** tab.
2. Click the **+ Function Instance** button.
3. Choose an easy-to-remember name for your function.
4. On the dropdown menu, select the **Add Request ID** function.
    - This action will load the **Arguments** tab.

In this case, the **Add Request ID** function can be used without any arguments. However, it has a single optional argument that can be used to modify the name of the header where the Request ID will be inserted.

| JSON Args key |Environment Variable Name | Data Type | Default Value | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `header_name` | `AZION_REQUEST_ID_HEADER_NAME` | String | `x-azn-request-id` | The name of the header where the function will insert the Request ID.  If the argument isn't a non-empty string, then the function will use the default value |

:::note
JSON Args have priority over environment variables. If both artifacts have value, the function will use whatever is defined in the JSON Args.
:::

5. When you're done, click the **Save** button.
</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.rtm">
1. Select the **Functions** tab.
2. Click the **Add Function** button.
3. Give an easy-to-remember name to your instance.
4. On the dropdown menu, select the **Add Request ID** function.

This action will load the function, showing a form with the function code and, just above it, two tabs: **Code** and **Args**.

By clicking the **Code** tab, you'll be able to navigate through the source code but not change it.

On the **Args** tab, you'll pass your variables. In this case, the **Add Request ID** function can be used without any arguments. However, it has a single optional argument that can be used to modify the name of the header where the Request ID will be inserted.

| JSON Args key |Environment Variable Name | Data Type | Default Value | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `header_name` | `AZION_REQUEST_ID_HEADER_NAME` | String | `x-azn-request-id` | The name of the header where the function will insert the Request ID.  If the argument isn't a non-empty string, then the function will use the default value |

:::note
JSON Args have priority over environment variables. If both artifacts have value, the function will use whatever is defined in the JSON Args.

### Setting up the Rules Engine

To finish, you have to set up a **Rules Engine** to configure the *criteria* and the *behavior* to run the function.

Still in the **Edge Firewall** page:

<Tabs client:visible>
    <Fragment slot="tab.console">Console</Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.rtm">Real-Time Manager</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.console">
1. Select the **Rules Engine** tab.
2. Click the **+ Rule Engine** button.
3. Give an easy-to-remember name to the rule.
   - You can add a description, but it's an optional step.
4. Select a *criteria* to run and catch the domains that you want to run the integration on. Example: `if Hostname is equal xxxxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`.
5. Below, select a *behavior* **Run Function**.
6. Select the adequate function according to the name you gave it in the previous step.
7. Click the **Save** button.

Done. You've now configured the **Add Request ID** integration and will start receiving the header.
