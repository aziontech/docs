<InterfaceNote />

Azion **Bot Manager Lite** is a *serverless* integration available at Azion **Marketplace**. It was built on top of an edge function on **Edge Firewall** that analyzes incoming requests and gives them a score based on a group of rules and behaviors. If the score is equal to or greater than the predetermined threshold, the integration executes the defined action. Otherwise, the request is processed (*allow*, as default action). Available actions for Bot Manager Lite: *allow*, *deny*, *drop*, *redirect*, *custom HTML*, *random delay*, and *hold the connection*.

This integration enables the detection of suspicious traffic and bad bots, facilitating the implementation of preventive measures against malicious activities such as credential stuffing, vulnerability scanning, and site scraping. Bot Manager Lite leverages machine learning and *Reputation Intelligence* to examine the behavior of incoming data.

:::note
This integration is a [lite version](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/bot-manager-lite/) available in the Marketplace.

Azion provides the Bot Manager add-on, a comprehensive solution for bot management. Contact the [Sales team](https://www.azion.com/pt-br/contate-vendas/) for more details on the Bot Manager subscription.

### Setting up the function

While still on the **Edge Firewall** page:

<Tabs client:visible>
    <Fragment slot="tab.console">Console</Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.rtm">Real-Time Manager</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.console">
1. Select the **Functions Instances** tab.
2. Click the **+ Function Instance** button.
3. Give an easy-to-remember name to your instance.
4. On the dropdown menu, select the **Azion Bot Manager Lite** function.

The **Arguments** code box is where you'll pass your variables.

```json
{
  "threshold": 10,
  "action": "deny"
}
```

Even when `threshold` and `action` are mandatory variables to be defined, you can add and define more variables, according to your needs, as shown in the example below:

```json
{
  "threshold": 10,
  "action": "deny",
  "disabled_rules": [],
  "log_tag": "my_custom_tag"
}
```

Where:

| Variable | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `action` | String | Yes | The action to be taken by the function whenever the request's score is greater or equals the defined threshold. Possible values: `allow`, `deny`, `redirect`, `custom_html`, `drop`, `random_delay`, and `hold_connection`. Read more about [configuring actions](#configuring-actions) |
| `threshold` | Number | Yes | The maximum score that the request can reach before the function takes an action. If it has no value, the function won't take action |
| `disabled_rules` | Array of numbers | No | The rules to be disabled. If a rule is disabled, it won't be processed nor increment the request score | 
| `internal_logs` | String | No | The *Logging Class* that the function will use. Possible values:<br/>`0`: write logs if the request score is greater than 0.<br/>`1`: only write logs if the request score is greater than 0, or if the request is classified as "Good Bot".<br/>`2`: always write logs.<br/>`3`: never write logs.<br/>Default value: `0`. When this field has no value or has an invalid value, the function will use the default value |
| `log_headers` | Array of strings | No | Defines which request headers should be included in the function's report log. For security reasons, the following headers are forbidden: <br> `authorization`, `cookie`, `proxy-authorization`, `set-cookie`, `x-csrf-token`, `x-api-key`, `x-amz-security-token`. </br> **Note**: the headers' values are going to be stored with base64 encode |
| `log_tag` | String | No | A tag to identify the function instance that generated the request in the logs.  It's recommended to use customized and unique tags |
| `session_signature_key` | String | No | This string is used to sign, as encrypted data, the signed bot session cookie. This validation protects against cookie tampering. If this field has no value or an invalid value, the function will use the default value `az` |
| `should_write_warning_logs` | Boolean | No | Defines whether the function will write warning logs to Real-Time Events. Default value: `false`|

5. When you're done, click the **Save** button.

### Setting up the Rules Engine

To finish, you have to set up a **Rules Engine** to configure the *behavior* and the *criteria* to run the integration.

Still in the **Edge Firewall** page:

<Tabs client:visible>
    <Fragment slot="tab.console">Console</Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.rtm">Real-Time Manager</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.console">
1. Select the **Rules Engine** tab.
2. Click the **+ Rules Engine** button.
3. Give an easy-to-remember name to the rule.
   - You can add a description, but it's an optional step.
4. Select a *criteria* to run and catch the domains that you want to run the integration on.
    - Use this rule: `if Request URI does not match "\.(png|jpg|css|js|jpeg|gif|ico|ttf|svg|woff|woff2|ashx|asmx|svc|swf|otf|eot)(\?.*)?$"`
        - This rule is strongly recommended to exclude all static data on your application to be processed by the function. You can customize this rule if needed.
5. You have to create additional *criteria* for this integration to work: `if Request URI does not match /.well-know/`
    - This rule is highly recommended to create a list of allowed IPs that don't impact automation or scripts to WEB API.
6. Below, select **Run Function** *behavior*.
7. Select the function according to the name you gave it in step 3.
8. Click the **Save** button.

On the Console, you must now configure your domain so it is protected by your edge firewall.

9. On the **Products menu**, select **Domains**.
10. Click on the domain you want to protect with your **Bot Manager Lite** function.
11. In the **Settings** section, click on the `Edge Firewall` selector and choose the edge firewall you've just created.
12. Click the **Save** button.

Done. You now have your domains protected against bot attacks by using Azion **Bot Manager Lite**.

## Configuring actions

Azion **Bot Manager Lite** can execute **7 different actions** whenever the request's score equals or exceeds the defined threshold. Read more about each one below:

1. `allow`: allows the continuation of the request. To enable this action, you must declare it as follows:

```json
  "action": "allow"
```

This action doesn't require any additional arguments. 

If the score is less than the predetermined threshold, the request is processed, being *allow* the default action.

2. `deny`: delivers a standard *Status Code 403* response. To enable this action, you must declare it as follows:

```json
  "action": "deny"
```

This action doesn't require any additional arguments.

3. `drop`: terminates the request without a response to the user. To enable this action, you must declare it as follows:

```json
  "action": "drop"
```

This action doesn't require any additional arguments.

4. `redirect`: allows the request to be redirected to a new URL/location when the security threshold is reached. To enable this action, you must declare the variables as in the example:

```json
  "action": "redirect",
  "redirect_to": "http://xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/"
```

Where `redirect_to`: defines the new URL/location to redirect the requests. If this field isn't filled or filled with a value that isn't a *string*, the function will behave as if the `allow` action was enabled.

5. `custom_html`: allows customized HTML content to be delivered to the user in case of a threshold violation. To enable this action, you must declare the variables as in the example:

```json
  "action": "custom_html",
  "custom_html": "This should be the custom HTML content",
  "custom_status_code": 418,
```

Where `custom_html` defines the HTML content to be delivered and `custom_status_code` is the status code to be delivered.

- If `custom_html` isn't filled or it's filled with a value that isn't a *string*, the function will behave as would happen with the `allow` action enabled.
- If `custom_status_code` isn't filled or it's filled with a value that isn't a *number*, the default value will be a *Status Code 200*.

6. `random_delay`: makes the function wait for a random period between *1* and *10* seconds before allowing the request to proceed. To enable this action, you must declare it as follows:

```json
  "action": "random_delay"
```

This action doesn't require any additional arguments.

7. `hold_connection`: holds the request, keeping the connection open for *1 minute* before dropping it. To enable this action, you must declare it as follows:

```json
  "action": "hold_connection"
```

This action doesn't require any additional arguments.

:::note
By using any value different from `allow`, `deny`, `redirect`, `custom_html`, `drop`, `random_delay`, or `hold_connection` for the `action` variable, the function will execute the default action, which is `allow`.
