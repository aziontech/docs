Azion **Bot Manager Lite** is a *serverless* integration available in the Azion **Marketplace**. It was built on top of an **function** on **Firewall**, which analyzes incoming requests and assigns them a score based on a set of rules and behaviors. If the score is equal to or greater than the predetermined threshold, the integration executes the defined action. Otherwise, the request is processed (*allow*, as default action). Available actions for Bot Manager Lite: *allow*, *deny*, *drop*, *redirect*, *custom HTML*, *random delay*, and *hold the connection*.

This integration enables the detection of suspicious traffic and bad bots, facilitating the implementation of preventive measures against malicious activities such as credential stuffing, vulnerability scanning, and site scraping. Bot Manager Lite leverages machine learning and *Reputation Intelligence* to analyze the behavior of incoming data.

:::note
This integration is a lite version of [Azion Bot Manager](https://www.azion.com/en/products/bot-manager/), a comprehensive solution for bot management.

Contact the [Sales team](https://www.azion.com/en/contact-sales/) for more details on the Bot Manager subscription.

:::caution[Warning]

### Setting up the function

While still on the **Firewall** page:

1. Select the **Functions Instances** tab.
2. Click the **+ Function Instance** button.
3. Give an easy-to-remember name to your instance.

The **Arguments** code box is where you'll pass your variables.

```json
{
  "threshold": 10,
  "action": "deny"
}
```

Even when `threshold` and `action` are mandatory variables to be defined, you can add and define more variables, according to your needs, as shown in the example below:

```json
{
  "threshold": 10,
  "action": "deny",
  "disabled_rules": [],
  "log_tag": "my_custom_tag"

    - Use this rule: `if Request URI does not match "\.(png|jpg|css|js|jpeg|gif|ico|ttf|svg|woff|woff2|ashx|asmx|svc|swf|otf|eot)(\?.*)?$"`
        - This rule is strongly recommended to exclude all static data on your application to be processed by the function. You can customize this rule if needed.
5. You have to create additional *criteria* for this integration to work: `if Request URI does not match /.well-know/`
    - This rule is highly recommended to create a list of allowed IPs that don't impact automation or scripts to WEB API.
6. Below, select **Run Function** *behavior*.
7. Select the adequate function according to the name you gave it during the instantiation step.
8. Click the **Save** button.

11. In the **Settings** section, click on the `Firewall` selector and choose the firewall you've just created.
