:::caution[important]
Azion has two user interfaces: Real-Time Manager and Console, which is in *Preview* stage. Currently, Console is only available for Developer plans and new accounts. Follow the steps according to the user interface you're using.
:::

**Upstash Waiting Room** is an integration that helps you manage traffic surges and prevent overload on your websites and applications. The integration uses a *First-In, First-Out (FIFO)* approach and leverages on Azion **Edge Firewall**, creating a waiting room to control and redirect access according to your parameters.

When a request is received by your website, Edge Firewall executes the integration. Then, the integration verifies if there's available space and moves the request from the waiting queue to the release queue. If there isn't availability, the request is redirected to the waiting room, receiving a number in the row to access.

## Requirements

To start using this integration, you need to:

- Create an [Upstash account](https://console.upstash.com/login).
