Azion **Send Event to Endpoint** is a *serverless* solution available at **Azion Marketplace**. This solution enables you to stream request data to an HTTP endpoint, taking the request data and transmitting it to a user-defined endpoint via Javascript fetch API. 

The solution also permits you to specify what kind of data you wish to capture by editing a `JSON` file.

After sending the collected data, the solution allows the request to proceed through the Rules Engine.

## Getting the solution

To use the Send Event to Endpoint solution, you have to: 

1. Log in to your [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/) account.
    - If you don’t have an account, you can create one [by visiting the sign-up page](https://sso.azion.com/).
2. On the upper-left corner of the RTM homepage, select **Products menu**, identified by the three horizontal lines, > **Marketplace**.
3. Select the search box and type *“Endpoint”* or browse through the cards to find the **Send Event to Endpoint** solution.
4. Once you’ve found the **Send Event to Endpoint** card, select it to go to the solution's page.
5. On the solution's page, look for the **Subscribe for** section on the bottom-right corner.
6. Click the **Get It Now** button.

> You’ll see a message indicating that your solution was successfully installed and is ready to use.

## Configuring the solution

### Setting up the Edge Firewall Rule

To instantiate the **Send Event to Endpoint** solution, follow these steps:

1. Under **Products menu**, select **Edge Firewall** in the **SECURE** section.
2. Click the **Add Rule Set** button.
3. Give an easy to remember name to your new rule.
4. Select the domains you want to protect with the function.
5. Turn the **Edge Functions** switch on.
6. Click the **Save** button.

Done. Now you have instantiated the rule for your function.

### Setting up the solution

To instantiate the **Send Event to Endpoint** solution, while still on the **Edge Firewall** page, select the **Functions** tab and follow these steps:

1. Click the **Add Function** button.
2. Give an easy to remember name to your instance.
3. On the dropdown menu, select the **Send Event to Endpoint** function.

After you select the solution, a **Code** form with the solution's source code will be loaded. This is just for study and can’t be modified. In the same form you have another tab: the **Args** tab. On the **Args** tab, you’ll pass the parameters to configure your solution.

The `JSON` **Args** form for this solution will look like this:

```json
{
  "metadata": ["remote_addr"],
  "headers": ["x-hello"],
  "body": ["message", "user.id"],
  "connection_args": {
	"endpoint": "http://example_api:3000/test",
	"headers": {
  	"Authorization": "FakeAuth",
  		"X-Provider": "Azion Cells"
	}
  }
}
```

**Where**: 

| Field | Is Required | Data Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `metadata` | No | Null or Array | Defines which metadata fields will be streamed.<br /><br />When `null` (or not set), all metadata fields will be streamed.<br /><br />If you don't want to stream any metadata, you must set an empty array `[ ]` as the value of this field. |
| `headers` | No | Null or Array | Defines which request headers will be streamed.<br /><br />When `null` (or not set), all request headers will be streamed.<br /><br />If you don't want to stream any header, you must set an empty array `[ ]` as the value of this field. |
| `body` | No | Null or Array | Defines which request body fields will be streamed.<br /><br />When `null` (or not set), all request body fields will be streamed.<br /><br />If you don't want to stream any body field, you must set an empty array `[ ]` as the value of this field.<br /><br />To filter multi-level fields, use the dot notation. For example, if you use the string 'user.name' here, the function will seek for the field 'name' within the object 'user' in the request body. |
| `connection_args` | Yes | Object | Defines the data that will be used to stream the request data.<br /><br />The URL to which the data will be posted is defined by the endpoint.<br /><br />The headers specify which headers will be included in the fetch request.<br /><br />An additional 'Content-Type: application/json' header will be used. |
| `s3_connection_args` | No | Object | Defines the arguments used to connect to the S3 bucket. |
| `s3_connection_args.full_host` | Only when using `s3_connection_args` | String | Defines the full host of the S3 bucket. |
| `s3_connection_args.region` | Only when using <br />`s3_connection_args` | String | Defines the region of the S3 bucket. |
| `s3_connection_args.access_key` | Only when using <br />`s3_connection_args` | String | Defines the access key to be used in the connection to the S3 bucket. |
| `s3_connection_args.secret_key` | Only when using <br />`s3_connection_args` | String | Defines the secret key to be used in the connection to the S3 bucket. |
| `s3_connection_args.file_path` | No | String | Defines the path where the file created by the function must be stored.<br /><br />Default value:<br /> `/` |
| `s3_connection_args.use_date_prefix` | No | String | When enabled, it'll include a sub-folder with the current date (in format YYYY-MM-DD) to the file path.<br /><br />Default value:<br /> `true` |

This solution will return a response with the data streamed in a `JSON` file that will look like this:

```json
{
  "body": {
	"field_a": <data>,
	...
  },
  "geoip_asn": <data>,
  "geoip_city": <data>,
  "geoip_city_continent_code": <data>,
  "geoip_city_country_code": <data>,
  "geoip_city_country_name": <data>,
  "geoip_continent_code": <data>,
  "geoip_country_code": <data>,
  "geoip_country_name": <data>,
  "geoip_region": <data>,
  "geoip_region_name": <data>,
  "headers": {
	"x-header-a": <data>,
	...
  },
  "remote_addr": <data>,
  "remote_port": <data>,
  "remote_user": <data>,
  "request_id": <data>,
  "request_url": <data>,
  "server_protocol": <data>,
  "ssl_cipher": <data>,
  "ssl_protocol": <data>
}
```

Notice how the `request_id`, `request_url`, and metadata fields will be delivered in the root of the `JSON` file, whereas the body fields and request headers will be sent in objects.

**Important**: you can also use a "catch-all" `JSON` Args file, like this:

```json
{
    "connection_args": {
        "endpoint": "http://example_api:3000/test", 
    }
}
```
### S3 output files

For each new function run, a new file will be produced in the given S3 bucket. The file will be named after the request ID that initiated the function. 

Example: if the `connection_args.file_path` parameter is set to `/my-data/` and the function is performed on May 9th, 2023, with the request ID `abcd-1234`, the resultant file will be saved at `/my-data/2023-05-09/abcd-1234.json`. If the `connection_args.use_date_prefix` parameter is set to `false`, the resultant file will be saved as `/my-data/abcd-1234.json`.

If there are no `http_connection_args` or `s3_connection_args` supplied in the JSON Args, the function doesn't have any valid connection arguments to utilize. Then, the request will be terminated, and a `JSON` error message will be sent to indicate the cause of the issue.

```json
{
  "error": "A001",
  "detail": "The function instance is missing or has invalid required arguments."
}
```

If the function is unable to connect to the HTTP endpoint or the S3 provider, the user request will be ignored. Regardless, an error log will be created, which the client may access via Data Streaming.

For example, if an invalid access key is used, the following notice will be displayed:

```json
[Send event to endpoint] S3 connection error; 
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<Error>
	<Code>InvalidAccessKeyId</Code>
	<Message>The key 'DAKEY' is not valid</Message>
</Error>
```

At last, if you supply the correct connection options for both the HTTP endpoint and the S3 bucket, the function will deliver event data to both sources at the same time.

## Setting up Rules Engine

To finish, you have to set up the **Rules Engine** to configure the *behavior* and the *criteria* to run the solution.

Still in the **Edge Firewall** page, select the **Rules Engine** tab and follow these steps:

1. Click the **New Rule** button.
2. Give an easy to remember name to the rule.
3. Select a *criteria* to run and catch the domain you want to run the solution on. For example: `if Hostname is equal xxxxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`.
4. Below, select a *behavior* to the *criteria*. In this case, it’ll be **Run Function**. Then, select the adequate **Send Event to Endpoint** function according to the name you gave it in the instantiating step.

Done. Now the **Send Event to Endpoint** solution is running for every request made to the domain you indicated.
