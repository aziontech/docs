The Request Variation Controller solution is, in fact, two solutions that work together to protect your online assets. 

In the response phase, the Hash Generator creates a signed cookie to track the different arguments the user (or the origin) is using across the requests. This cookie will be used for the second solution, the Hash Validator, which checks the number of variations made and blocks access to the origin whenever the user exceeded the maximum number permitted.

---

## Getting the solution

The Request Variation Controller solution is a serverless solution available at Azion Marketplace.

Remember, this solution is divided into two. To run it, you have to install the hash generator and the hash validator.

With the help of this solution, a signed cookie can be created or updated, containing details about how many different requests were made in succession to an edge application.

1. Log in to your [Real-Time Manager (RTM) account](https://manager.azion.com/).
    - If you don’t have one yet, create an account visiting the [sign-up page](https://manager.azion.com/signup/).
2. On the upper-left corner of the page, select **Products menu** > **Marketplace**.
3. Select the search box and type “*variation*” or browse through the cards to find the two Request Variation Controller solutions.
4. Once you’ve found the **Request Variation Controller - Hash Generator** and **Request Variation Controller - Hash Validator** cards, select one to go to the solution's page.
5. On the solution page, look for the **Subscribe for** section on the bottom-right corner.
6. Click the **Get It Now** button.

You'll follow the same steps to install the second solution, only changing the name of the solution in step 3.

> In both cases, after clicking on the **Get it now** button, you’ll see a message indicating that your solution was successfully installed and is ready to use.

## Using the solution

Once you've gotten your solution on **Marketplace**, it'll be available at your edge functions list. To use the solution, you'll have to create a new edge application.

To create an edge application you have three options:

- By visiting the documentation on [getting started](/en/documentation/products/getting-started/). 
- Through **RTM**, on the upper-left corner of the page, select **Products menu** > **Edge Application** and follow the instructions.
- Using an already existing edge application.

## Configuring the solution

To configure your solution, proceed as follows:

1. On the upper-left corner, select **Products menu** > **Edge Application** on the **BUILD** section.
2. On the listing page of your edge applications, select the one you’ve created to use with the Request Variation Controller solution.
3. On the application page, on the **Main Settings** tab, locate the **Functions** switch and turn it on to enable Functions on your edge application.
4. Still on the application page, on the **Main Settings** tab, locate the **Application Acceleration** switch and turn it on to enable the *Forward Cookies* functionality for your application; this will be addressed at the [Rules Engine section](#rules-engine).
5. Click the **Save** button.

> You’ll receive a message indicating your edge application was successfully updated.

## Instantiating the solution

To enable this function, while still on the **Edge Application** page:

1. Select the **Functions** tab on the top list.
2. Click the **Add Function** button.
3. Choose an easy to remember name for your function.
4. On the dropdown function menu, select the *Variation Request* function.

This action will load the function, showing a form with the function code and, just above it, two tabs: **Code** and **Args**. By clicking on the Code tab you will be able to navigate through the code, but won't be able to change it.

As you have two solutions, you'll have to configure two Args tabs, one for the response phase and another one for the request phase.

For the **response phase**, the Args are:

```json
{
    "cookie_name": "azn",
    "cookie_secret": "1234567890123456",
    "cookie_max_age": 45,
    "args_list": ["http_x_something", "http_x_another_thing",
    "request_body_userid"]
}
```
**Where**:

`cookie_name`: defines the name of the cookie. The default value is "azn".
`cookie_secret`: defines the key used to encrypt the signed cookie. Due to the encryption algorithm used here, the AES-128, this key must have exactly 16 chars.
`cookie_max_age`: define the time for the expiration of the cookie. If you don't define any time (passing a null value or none value), the cookie will be a session cookie. The default value is 45.
`args_list`: defines the nginx list of variables that will be analyzed on the user's request. Whenever this changes, the count of changes will be increased. These parameters will be used to block or allow the access.

For the **request phase**, the Args are:

```json
{
"cookie_name": "azn",
"cookie_secret": "1234567890123456",
"max_variation": 6,
"max_unique_variation": 2
}
```

**Where**:

`cookie_name`: defines the name of the cookie. It must be the same as the one defined at the response phase.
`cookie_secret`: defines the secret key for the cookie. It must be the same as the one defined at the response phase.
`max_variation`: defines the maximum number of any kind of variation in the parameters.
`max_unique_variation`: defines the maximum number of unique variations in the parameters.

This function decrypts the signed cookie and checks to see if any cookie variants have been reached. If they have, a new request header with the name `[COOKIE_ NAME]-[VIOLATION TYPE]-[TRUE]` will be appended to the request.

**Possible violations can assume 3 values:**

- **All Variations**: regardless of whether there are repeated values, it counts the number of times the cookie's value was altered. For instance, if the cookie value changed from "nothing" to "A" in the first request, "A" to "B" in the second, "C" in the third, "B" to "C" in the fourth, "B" to "A" in the fifth, and finally "A" in the sixth request, the total number of variations would be 5. If the cookie has the default name, the violation header that is added to the request when this violation occurs is `http_cookie_name_any_variation_violation`.

- **Unique variations**: counts the number of distinct values that have been assigned to the cookie since its creation. Given that the cookie only had "A," "B," and "C" as distinct values, the unique variation for the same example as above would be 3. Assuming the cookie has the default name, when this violation occurs, a violation header called `http_cookie_name_unique_variation_violation` would be added to the request.

- **Signature Violation**: when the function is unable to decrypt the signed cookie (for example, because it was signed with a different key or because the cookie was altered on the client side), this violation will be brought about. Assuming the cookie has the default name, when this violation is triggered, the request will have the violation header `http_cookie_name_signature_violation` added to it.

## Configuring a rule on Rules Engine

Still in the **Edge Application** page, in the **Rules Engine** tab, you have to configure the rules you want (*criteria* and *behavior*) to apply to run your function.

You have to configure the **response phase** for the Rules Engine.

To do so, follow these steps:

1. Select the **Rules Engine** tab.
2. Click the **New Rule** button and select **Response Phase**.
3. Give an easy to remember name to your rule.
4. Pass the *criteria* you need to in order to run your solution.
5. On the behavior field, select **Run Function** from the dropdown menu and then select the *Variation Request - Hash Generator* function, according to the name you gave it in the instantiation step.
6. Click the **Save** button.

Now, you have to configure the **request phase** for the Rules Engine.

To do so, follow these steps:

1. Select the **Rules Engine** tab.
2. Click the **New Rule** button and select **Request Phase**.
3. Give an easy to remember name to your rule.
4. Pass the *criteria* you need to in order to run your solution.
5. On the behavior field, select **Run Function** from the dropdown menu and then select the *Variation Request - Hash Validator* function, according to the name you gave it in the instantiation step.
6. You'll need a **second** behavior for the Request Variation Controller function, the *Forward Cookies*. To add this, click the `+` button and select the *Forward Cookies* option from the dropdown menu.
7. Click the **Save** button.

Done. You've successfully instantiated your two solutions and now you're protected against attackers.
