The **Radware Bot Manager** integration uses a proprietary engine, called **Intent-based Deep Behavior Analysis** (IDBA), that collects more than 250 parameters, as well as a behavioral modeling granular intent analysis to understand the intent of the visitor. Thus, the Radware Bot Manager is a complete integration to defend your online assets against bot attacks, such as account takeover, form spam, ad fraud, and many others OWASP threats.

}
```

1. Click the **New Rule** button.
2. Give a name to the rule.
3. Select a *criteria* to run and catch the domains that you want to run the integration on. For example: `if Hostname is equal xxxxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`.
4. Below, select a *behavior* to the *criteria*. In this case, it'll be **Run Function**. 
    - Select the adequate **Radware Bot Manager** function according to the name you gave it in the instantiate step.
5. Click the **Save** button.

Done. Now the **Radware Bot Manager** integration is running for every request made to the domain you indicated.
