The **Radware Bot Manager** integration uses a proprietary engine, called **Intent-based Deep Behavior Analysis** (IDBA), that collects more than 250 parameters, as well as a behavioral modeling granular intent analysis to understand the intent of the visitor. Thus, the Radware Bot Manager is a complete integration to defend your online assets against bot attacks, such as account takeover, form spam, ad fraud, and many others OWASP threats.

## Configuring the integration

The integration obtained from the Marketplace is added to your list of **Functions**. This integration runs under Azion **Firewall**; therefore, you must configure it before using it.

### Setting up a firewall

To instantiate the **Radware Bot Manager** integration, follow the steps:

1. Under **Products Menu**, select **Firewall** in the **SECURE** section.
2. Click the **+ Firewall** button.
3. Give a name to your firewall.
4. Click the **Edge Functions** switch to enable functions on your edge application.
5. Click the **Save** button.

Done. Now you have instantiated the firewall for your function.

### Setting up the Firewall function 

To instantiate the **Radware Bot Manager** integration, while still on the Firewall page:

1. Select the **Functions Instances** tab.
2. Click the **+ Function Instance** button.
3. Give a name to your instance.
4. On the dropdown menu, select the **Radware Bot Manager** function.
  - This action will load the **Arguments** tab.
5. On the **Arguments** tab, add the parameters.

The name listed on the dropdown menu is different from the name on the Marketplace.
:::

The **Arguments** tab will load a JSON file which looks like this:

```json
{
    "api_key": "Your-API-Key",
    "env_id": "Your-Env-ID"
}
```

6. Click the **Save** button.

Done. Now your Radware Bot Manager instance is saved.

### Setting up the Firewall Rules Engine

To finish, you have to set up a **Rules Engine** to configure the *behavior* and the *criteria* to run the function.

Still in the **Firewall** page:

1. Select the **Rules Engine** tab.
2. Click the **+ Rule Engine** button.
3. Give a name to the rule.
4. Select a *criteria* to run and catch the domains that you want to run the integration on.
  - Example: if `Host` *matches* `yourdomain.com`.
5. Below, select a *behavior* to the *criteria*. In this case, it'll be **Run Function**. 
    - Select the adequate function according to the name you gave it during the instantiation step.
6. Click the **Save** button.

On the Console, you must now configure your domain so it is protected by your firewall.

7. On the **Products menu**, select **Domains**.
8. Click on the domain you want to protect with your Radware Bot Manager function.
9. In the **Settings** section, click on the `Firewall` selector and choose the firewall you've just created.
10. Click the **Save** button.

Done. Now the **Radware Bot Manager** integration is running for every request made to the domain you indicated.
