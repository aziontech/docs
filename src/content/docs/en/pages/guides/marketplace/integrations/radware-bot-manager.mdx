1. Click the **New Rule** button.
2. Give a name to the rule.
3. Select a *criteria* to run and catch the domains that you want to run the solution on. For example: `if Hostname is equal xxxxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`.

    - Select the adequate Radware Bot Manager function according to the name you gave it in the instantiate step.
