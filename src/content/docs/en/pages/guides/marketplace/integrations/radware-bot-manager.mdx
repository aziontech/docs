<InterfaceNote />

The **Radware Bot Manager** integration uses a proprietary engine, called **Intent-based Deep Behavior Analysis** (IDBA), that collects more than 250 parameters, as well as a behavioral modeling granular intent analysis to understand the intent of the visitor. Thus, the Radware Bot Manager is a complete integration to defend your online assets against bot attacks, such as account takeover, form spam, ad fraud, and many others OWASP threats.
