**Limit Payload Size** is a *serverless* integration available at Azion Marketplace.

The integration employs an edge function to evaluate request data and deny payloads that exceed a predefined limit. The function validates the request payload size by checking the `Content-Length` header. The `Content-Length` header is required, making it safe to read instead of always reading the body. The users are safeguarded against attempts to change the header's value in this way, and reading the `Content-Length` header is the best course of action from a performance standpoint.

## Configuring the integration

This is an edge firewall integration, so, you'll have to instantiate the integration on the Edge Firewall page. Follow the steps below to do this.

### Setting up an edge firewall

To instantiate the **Limit Payload Size** integration, follow the steps:

<Tabs client:visible>
    <Fragment slot="tab.console">Console</Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.rtm">Real-Time Manager</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.console">
1. On the **Products menu**, select **Edge Firewall** in the **SECURE** section.
2. Click the **+ Edge Firewall** button.
3. Give an easy to remember name to your edge firewall.
4. Click the **Edge Functions** switch to enable functions on your edge firewall.
5. Click the **Save** button.

Done. Now you've instantiated the edge firewall for your function.
</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.rtm">
1. On the **Products menu**, select **Edge Firewall** in the **SECURE** section.
2. Click the **Add Rule Set** button.
3. Give an easy to remember name to your edge firewall.
4. Select the domains you want to protect with the function.
5. Click the **Edge Functions** switch to enable functions on your edge firewall.
6. Click the **Save** button.

Done. Now you've instantiated the edge firewall for your function.
</Fragment>

</Tabs>

### Setting up the Edge Firewall function

To instantiate the **Limit Payload Size** integration, while still on the **Edge Firewall** page:

<Tabs client:visible>
    <Fragment slot="tab.console">Console</Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.rtm">Real-Time Manager</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.console">
1. Select the **Functions Instances** tab.
2. Click the **+ Function Instance** button.
3. Give an easy to remember name to your instance.
4. On the dropdown menu, select the **Limit Payload Size** function.
  - This action will load the **Arguments** tab.
5. On the **Arguments** tab, add the parameters.

For this integration, you only have to pass one argument in the Args JSON file:

```json
{
    "max_payload_length": "10kb"
}
```

Some information about how this integration works:

- The `max_payload_length` is the maximum size of the payload you'll accept. 
- This field accepts bytes, kilobytes, and megabytes as argument. 
- If you don't specify the unit of the payload size, it'll be assumed as bytes. 
- If you don't pass any argument, the function will bypass the execution. 
- Whenever the size exceeds the threshold set by the user, the integration will return a **403 error**.

6. Click the **Save** button.
</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.rtm">
1. Select the **Functions** tab and follow these steps:
2. Click the **Add Function** button.
3. Give an easy to remember name to your instance.
4. On the dropdown menu, select the **Limit Payload Size** function.

This action will load the function, showing a form with the function code and, just above it, two tabs: **Code** and **Args**. By clicking on the Code tab, you'll be able to navigate through the code, but not to change it.

For this integration, you only have to pass one argument in the Args JSON file:

```json
{
    "max_payload_length": "10kb"
}
```

- Whenever the size exceeds the threshold set by the user, the integration will return a **403 error**.

5. Click the **Save** button.

### Setting up the Edge Firewall Rules Engine

To finish, you have to set up the [Rules Engine](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-firewall/rules-engine/) to configure the *behavior* and the *criteria* to run the function.

Still on the **Edge Firewall** page:

<Tabs client:visible>
    <Fragment slot="tab.console">Console</Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.rtm">Real-Time Manager</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.console">
1. Select the **Rules Engine** tab.
2. Click the **+ Rule Engine** button.
3. Give a name to the rule.
4. Select a *criteria* to run and catch the domains that you want to run the integration on.
  - Example: if `Host` *matches* `yourdomain.com`.
5. Below, select a *behavior* to the *criteria*. In this case, it'll be **Run Function**. 
    - Select the adequate function according to the name you gave it in the instantiate step.
6. Click the **Save** button.

On the Console, you must now configure your domain so it is protected by your Edge Firewall.

7. On the **Products menu**, select **Domains**.
8. Click on the domain you want to protect with your Limit Payload Size function.
9. In the **Settings** section, click on the `Edge Firewall` selector and choose the Edge Firewall you've just created.
10. Click the **Save** button.

Done. Now the Limit Payload Size integration is running for every request made to the domain you indicated.
</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.rtm">
1. Select the **Rules Engine** tab.
2. Click the **New Rule** button.
3. Give a name to the rule.
4. Select a *criteria* to run and catch the domain you want to run the integration on.
5. Below, select a behavior to the *criteria*. In this case, it'll be a **Run Function**.
6. Select the adequate **Limit Payload Size** function according to the name you gave it in the instantiate step.
7. Click the **Save** button.

Done. Now the Limit Payload Size integration is running for every request made to the domain you indicated.
