The Limit Payload Size solution is a *serverless* solution available at Azion Marketplace.

The solution employs an edge function to evaluate request data and deny payloads that exceed a predefined limit. The function validates the request payload size by checking the `Content-Length` header. The `Content-Length` header is required, making it safe to read instead of always reading the body. The users are safeguarded against attempts to change the header's value in this way, and reading the `Content-Length` header is the best course of action from a performance standpoint.

## Using the solution

This is an edge firewall solution, so, you'll have to instantiate the solution on the Edge Firewall section. Follow the steps below to do this.

### Setting up the Edge Firewall rule 

To instantiate the Limit Payload Size solution, follow the steps:

1. On the **Products menu**, select **Edge Firewall** in the **SECURE** section.
2. Click the **Add Rule Set** button.
3. Give an easy to remember name to your new rule.
4. Select the domains you want to protect with the function.
5. Click the **Function** switch to enable functions on your edge application.
6. Click the **Save** button.

Done. Now you have instantiated the rule for your function.

### Setting up the Edge Firewall function

To instantiate the Limit Payload Size solution, while still on the Edge Firewall page, select the Functions tab and follow these steps:

1. Click the **Add Function** button.
2. Give an easy to remember name to your instance.
3. On the dropdown menu, select the **Limit Payload Size** function.

This action will load the function, showing a form with the function code and, just above it, two tabs: **Code** and **Args**. By clicking on the Code tab, you'll be able to navigate through the code, but not to change it.

For this solution, you only have to pass one argument in the Args JSON file:

```json
{
    "max_payload_length": "10kb"
}
```

Some information about how this solution works:

- The `max_payload_length` is the maximum size of the payload you'll accept. 
- This field accepts bytes, kilobytes, and megabytes as argument. 
- If you don't specify the unit of the payload size, it'll be assumed as bytes. 
- If you don't pass any argument, the function will bypass the execution. 
- Whenever the size exceeds the threshold set by the user, the solution will return a 403 error.

## Setting up the Edge Firewall Rules Engine

To finish, you have to set up the [Rules Engine](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/rules-engine/) to configure the *behavior* and the *criteria* to run the function.

Still on the **Edge Firewall** page, select the Rules Engine tab and follow these steps:

1. Click the **New Rule** button.
2. Give a name to the rule.
3. Select a *criteria* to run and catch the domain you want to run the solution on.
4. Below, select a behavior to the *criteria*. In this case, it’ll be a **Run Function**.
5. Select the adequate **Limit Payload Size** function according to the name you gave it in the instantiate step.
6. Click the **Save** button.

Done. Now the Limit Payload Size solution is running for every request made to the domain you indicated.
