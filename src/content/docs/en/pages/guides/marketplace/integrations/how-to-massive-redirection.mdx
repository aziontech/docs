### Instantiating the integration

To enable this function:

1. Select the **Functions Instances** tab.
2. Click the **+ Function Instance** button.
3. Choose an easy to remember name for your function.
4. On the function dropdown menu, select the **Massive Redirect [Global]** function.

This action will load the **Arguments** tab, where you can add the parameters to execute your application.

:::note
You have several sections on the **Arguments** tab. This happens because you can configure several different redirections at the same time.
:::

The **Arguments** tab will show a JSON file like the one below:

```json
[
  {
    "from": "https://www.azion.com.br",
    "found": "https://www.azion.com"
  }, {
    "from_regex": "http://www\\.(azion)\\.com$",
    "moved": "https://www.%s.com"
  },{
    "from_regex":"http://www\\.azion\\.com/t/other/([\\w_]+)/([\\w_]+)/([\\w_]+)/$",
    "moved":"https://www.azion.com.br/doc/%3$/%1$/%2$/"
  }
]
```

Where:
1. `from`: this is where you'll pass the previous URL, the one you want to redirect to a new one.
2. `moved`: this is where you'll pass the new URL, the one you want to be the target of your redirect rule. This URL will be used as a permanent redirect to the previous URL.
3. `from_regex`: this option permits you to pass multiple redirections in one command, passing more than one address in one line.
4. `found`: this is the same as *moved*, but in this case you have a temporary redirect to a URL.

:::note
If you forgot to pass either the `moved` and/or `found` keys in the **Args** tab you'll receive an error message with the code `JA001`. 
:::

### Configuring a rule on Rules Engine

Still in the **Applications** page, in the **Rules Engine** tab, you have to configure the rules you want (*criteria* and *behavior*) to apply to run your function.

To do this, select the **Rules Engine** tab and proceed as follow:

1. Add a new rule by clicking on the **+ Rule** button.
2. Give an easy-to-remember name and, optionally, a description to your rule.
3. Select the **Request Phase**.
4. Set a criteria for checking your domain. You'll have something like `if: ${domain} is equal xpto.com`.
5. On the behavior section, on `Then`, select `Run a Function` from the dropdown menu and then select the **Massive Redirect** option according to the name you gave it. 
6. Click the **Save** button.
