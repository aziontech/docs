**Massive Redirect** is a *serverless* integration available at Azion Marketplace. This type of integration is mainly used for handling a massive quantity of domain redirects, such as domain migrations.

This integration permits you to control this domain redirection directly at the network's edge, centralizing the management of several settings in one location. It also enables you to operate a variety of situations, such as CMS or e-commerce platform migration, website upgrades, and many others. No matter how many pages you have, you can configure all your redirects with the Massive Redirect integration.

:::note
You have to observe the limit of 300 kb for the JSON file.

## Getting the integration

To use the **Massive Redirect** integration provided by Azion Marketplace, you have to:

2. On the Marketplace homepage, select the integration's card.
3. Once the integration's page opens, click the **Get It Now** button, at the bottom-right corner of the page.

You'll see a message indicating that your integration was successfully installed.

:::tip

## Configuring the integration

Once you've gotten your integration on **Marketplace**, it'll be available at your edge functions list. To use the integration, you'll have to create a new edge application.

:::tip
To create an edge application, go to the [building](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/build-an-application/) section.
:::


## Configuring the integration

To configure your integration, proceed as follows:

1. On the upper-left corner, select **Products menu** > **Edge Application** on the **BUILD** section.
2. On the listing page of your edge applications, select the one you want to use with the integration.
3. On the application page, on the **Main Settings** tab, locate the **Edge Functions** switch and turn it on.
4. Click the **Save** button.

You'll receive a successful message indicating you have updated your edge application.

## Instantiating the integration

To enable this function:
1. Select the **Functions** tab on the top list.
2. Click the **Add Function** button.
3. Choose an easy to remember name for your function.
4. On the function dropdown menu, select the **Massive Redirect [Global]** function.

This action will load the function, showing a form with the function source code and, just above it, two tabs: **Code** and **Args**. By clicking on the Code tab you'll be able to navigate through the code, but won't be able to change it. The configuration of your Massive Redirect function will be made on the **Args** tab.

Click on the **Args** tab to open the form with the JSON **Args** where you'll add the parameters to execute your application.

:::note
You have several sections on the **Args** tab. This happens because you can configure several different redirections at the same time.
:::

The Args tab will show a JSON file like the one below:

```json
[
  {
    "from": "http://www.azion.com.br",
    "found": "http://www.azion.com"
  }, {
    "from_regex": "http://www\\.(azion)\\.com$",
    "moved": "https://www.%s.com"
  },{
    "from_regex":"http://www\\.azion\\.com/t/other/([\\w_]+)/([\\w_]+)/([\\w_]+)/$",
    "moved":"http://www.azion.com.br/doc/%3$/%1$/%2$/"
  }
]
```

Where:
1. `from`: this is where you'll pass the previous URL, the one you want to redirect to a new one.
2. `moved`: this is where you'll pass the new URL, the one you want to be the target of your redirect rule. This URL will be used as a permanent redirect to the previous URL.
3. `from_regex`: this option permits you to pass multiple redirections in one command, passing more than one address in one line.
4. `found`: this is the same as *moved*, but in this case you have a temporary redirect to a URL.

:::note
If you forgot to pass either the `moved` and/or `found` keys in the **Args** tab you'll receive an error message with the code `JA001`. 
:::

## Configuring a rule on Rules Engine

Still in the **Edge Application** page, in the **Rules Engine** tab, you have to configure the rules you want (*criteria* and *behavior*) to apply to run your function.

To do this, select the Rules Engine tab and proceed as follow:

1. Add a new rule by clicking on the **New Rule** button and then selecting the **Request Phase**.
2. Set a criteria for checking your domain. You'll have something like `if: ${domain} is equal xpto.com`.
3. On the behavior section, on `Then`, select `Run a Function` from the dropdown menu and then select the Massive Redirect option according to the name you gave it. 
4. Click the **Save** button on the lower-right corner.
