The Azion **Bot Protection** is a *serverless* integration available at [Azion Marketplace](/en/documentation/products/marketplace/). It analyzes incoming requests using an edge function running on **Edge Firewall** and assigns a score based on rules and behaviors. If the score exceeds a predetermined threshold, the integration declines or cancels the request. 

Using advanced algorithms that analyze the behavior of incoming data, they can detect and prevent malicious activities such as credential stuffing, vulnerability scanning, and site scraping. The system employs *Reputation Intelligence* to establish a profile of each person who visits the site, including location, device kind, and browsing patterns, allowing for instant identification of suspicious behavior and preventative actions against prospective assaults.

## Getting the integration

To use Azion **Bot Protection**, access [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/) and go to **Marketplace**.

On the Marketplace's homepage, select the integration's card.

Once the integration's page opens, click the **Get It Now** button, at the bottom-right corner of the page, and a successful message appears to confirm your integration is installed.

## Configuiring the integration

### Setting up the Edge Firewall rule 

To instantiate Azion **Bot Protection**, follow the steps:

1. On the upper-left corner, select **Products menu** > **Edge Firewall** in the **SECURE** section.
2. Click the **Add Rule Set** button.
3. Give an easy-to-remember name to your new rule.
4. Select the domains you want to protect with the function.
5. Enable the **Edge Functions** switch in the **Edge Firewall Modules** section.
6. Click the **Save** button.

Done. Now you've instantiated the rule for your function and have access to edge functions on your edge firewall.

### Setting up the function 

While still on the **Edge Firewall** page:

1. Select the **Functions** tab.
2. Click the **Add Function** button.
3. Give an easy-to-remember name to your instance.
4. On the dropdown menu, select the **Azion Bot Protection** function.

This action will load the function, showing a form with the function code and, just above it, two tabs: **Code** and **Arguments**. On the **Arguments** tab, you’ll pass your variables.

```json
{
  "threshold": 10,
  "action": "deny"
}
````

Where:

| Variable  | Description  |
|---|---|
| `threshold` |   |
| `action` |   |


When you're done, click the **Save** button.

### Setting up the Rules Engine

To finish, you have to set up a **Rules Engine** to configure the *behavior* and the *criteria* to run the function.

Still in the **Edge Firewall** page:

1. Select the **Rules Engine** tab.
2. Click the **New Rule** button.
3. Give an easy-to-remember name to the rule.
   - You can add a description, but it's an optional step.
4. Select a *criteria* to run and catch the domains that you want to run the integration on. 
    - Use this rule: `if Request URI does not match "\.(png|jpg|css|js|jpeg|gif|ico|ttf|svg|woff|woff2|ashx|asmx|svc|swf|otf|eot)(\?.*)?$"`
        - This rule is necessary to exclude all static data on your application.
5. You have to create another criteria for this integration to work: `if Request URI does not match /.well-know/`
    - This rule is necessary to create a list of allowed IPs that doesn't impact automation or scripts to WEB API.
6. Below, select a *behavior* to the *criteria*. In this case, it’ll be **Run Function**.
  - Select the adequate function according to the name you gave it in the instantiate step.
7. Click the **Save** button.

Done. You now have your domains protected against bot attacks by using Azion **Bot Protection**.

## Integrating with a SIEM

If you require the Bot Protection logs, you may join a SIEM platform to obtain full data. To do so, in the **Arguments** tab, update the function and put in the SIEM connection data.

### SIEM connection example

```json
{
"siem_integration": true,
  "send_data_to_siem_when": "always",
  "siem_connection_args": {
    "host": "example.com",
    "uri": "/inspect/01g43ftztkqgvcr65pjwbr0227",
    "port": "443",
    "scheme": "https",
    "additional_headers": {
      "Authorization": "secret123"
      }
   }
}
```
Where: 

| Variable  | Description  |
|---|---|
| `siem_integration` |   |
| `send_data_to_siem_when` |   |
| `siem_connection_args` |   |
| `host` |   |
| `uri` |   |
| `port` |   |
| `scheme` |   |
| `additional_headers` |   |

### Log Example

```json
{
  "geoip_region": "SP",
  "action": "deny",
  "asn": "396982",
  "request_id": "9581e2b51b5a082b12fed308f4eae564",
  "host": "ojgayey.map.azionedge.com",
  "classified": "bad bot",
  "geoip_country": "BR",
  "http_user_agent": "curl/7.87.0",
  "bot category": [
    "Bad Bot Signatures"
  ],
  "request_uri": "/a",
  "remote_addr": "34.95.175.91",
  "score": 8
}
```
Where: 

| Variable  | Description  |
|---|---|
| `geoip_region` |   |
| `action` |   |
| `asn` |   |
| `request_id` |   |
| `host` |   |
| `classified` |   |
| `geoip_country` |   |
| `http_user_agent` |   |
| `bot category` |   |

## Important

Azion will provide you with easy-to-go configurations, that should be enough for most of the cases. If you need a more detailed configuration, you can edit the`JSON` file for the integration.

To find this file:

1. On the RTM homepage, select the **Products menu**, indicated by the three horizontal lines on the upper-left corner.
2. Under the **SECURE** section, select **Edge Firewall**.
3. Locate the **Azion Bot Protection** edge function and click on it to load the integration's source-code form.
4. Select the **Arguments** tab.

This will load a `JSON` file where you'll be able to tune **Azion Bot Protection** according to the necessities of your business.
