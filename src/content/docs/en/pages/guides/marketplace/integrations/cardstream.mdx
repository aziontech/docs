<InterfaceNote />

**Axur Cardstream** is an integration that helps you protect your e-commerce from fraud even on the first purchase and, consequently, avoid the chargeback.

It is a global list of cards leaked on the internet, deep and dark web. With the API working, everytime your client makes a purchase, it's possible to check if the card has been exposed, request additional verification or even cancel the transaction.

## Requirements

To start using this integration, you need to:

- Create an [Axur account](https://www.axur.com/en-us/).
