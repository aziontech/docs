Azion **Fingerprint** enables you to capture device and network data to better identify devices accessing your applications. It can be classified as a *Session Fingerprinting* integration and uses the collected data to generate a unique identifier and add it as a request header.

This integration includes two features:

- A **browser-level script** (optional): a [JavaScript code](#embedding-the-script) that could be added to the web page. It captures data about the browser and sets it as a session cookie named `_azfp_sc`, so this data is always sent by the browser. Even when the usage of this script is optional, it increases the precision of the integration.
- An **edge function** (mandatory): a function to capture connection-related data as well as the "frontend fingerprint" (created by the browser script), when available, to create the session fingerprint. It'll then add this fingerprint as a request header named `X-AZFP`.

## Embedding the script

The browser script is a JavaScript code that runs on the web page you want to fingerprint, a process also known as JavaScript injection. It captures multiple data from the web browser:

- Audio and video support
- Canvas rendering
- If the browser has access to device-level API, such as accelerometer and gyroscope
- Manufacturer's data
- Timezone
- WebGL rendering

Then, it creates a unique identifier containing all this information and sets it as a session cookie named `_azfp_sc`, as cookies are always sent in the requests made by the browser. The script checks if the session cookie already exists. If so, it won't create a new one.

Azion provides a code sample for this JavaScript injection that you can include in your project. To do so:

1. Add [this file](https://mal2u8n8zk.map.azionedge.net/274addd29ac1edb2b200a297b98581cd88465e2ee36f18cfdbdc063402063fe5.js) to your HTML source, following this example:

```bash
<script src="https://mal2u8n8zk.map.azionedge.net/274addd29ac1edb2b200a297b98581cd88465e2ee36f18cfdbdc063402063fe5.js"></script>
```

Alternatively, you can also:

1. Copy the code in [this file](https://mal2u8n8zk.map.azionedge.net/274addd29ac1edb2b200a297b98581cd88465e2ee36f18cfdbdc063402063fe5.js).
2. Create a new JavaScript file with the code.
3.  Include the JavaScript file in your project folder.
    1. In this example, the file name is `fingerprint-script.js`
4. Then, add it to your HTML source, following this example:

```bash
<script src="https://example.com/fingerprint-script.js"></script>
```

Where: 
- `https://example.com/` is your domain.
- `fingerprint-script.js` is your JavaScript file name.
