Azion **Fingerprint** enables you to capture device and network data to better identify devices accessing your applications. It can be classified as a *Session Fingerprinting* integration and uses the collected data to generate a unique identifier and add it as a request header.

This integration includes two features:

- A **browser-level script** (optional): a [JavaScript code](#embedding-the-script) that could be added to the web page. It captures data about the browser and sets it as a session cookie named `_azfp_sc`, so this data is always sent by the browser. Even when the usage of this script is optional, it increases the precision of the integration.
- An **edge function** (mandatory): a function to capture connection-related data as well as the "frontend fingerprint" (created by the browser script), when available, to create the session fingerprint. It'll then add this fingerprint as a request header named `X-AZFP`.

## Embedding the script

The browser script is a JavaScript code that runs on the web page you want to fingerprint, a process also known as JavaScript injection. It captures multiple data from the web browser:

- Audio and video support
- Canvas rendering
- If the browser has access to device-level API, such as accelerometer and gyroscope
- Manufacturer's data
- Timezone
- WebGL rendering

Then, it creates a unique identifier containing all this information and sets it as a session cookie named `_azfp_sc`, as cookies are always sent in the requests made by the browser. The script checks if the session cookie already exists. If so, it won't create a new one.

Azion provides a code sample for JavaScript injection. 

1. You can find the code in [this file](https://mal2u8n8zk.map.azionedge.net/274addd29ac1edb2b200a297b98581cd88465e2ee36f18cfdbdc063402063fe5.js).
2. Then, add it on your HTML source. Example: 

```bash
<script src="anything.azion.xyz/arquivo.js"></script>
```

:::note
This is an optional step. However, using this script increases the precision of the **Fingerprint** integration. The code is a modularized script, in order to avoid collateral damage in any other scripts that might be running in the same web page.

## Getting the integration

To install Azion **Fingerprint**:

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/) > **Marketplace**.
2. On the Marketplace's homepage, select the integration's card.
3. Once the integration's page opens, click the **Get It Now** button, at the bottom-right corner of the page.

A successful message appears to confirm your integration is installed.

:::tip
You can search any integration by browsing through the cards or typing a keyword in the search bar.

## Configuring the integration

### Setting up an edge firewall

To do so, follow the steps:

1. On the upper-left corner, select **Products menu** > **Edge Firewall** in the **SECURE** section.
2. Click the **Add Rule Set** button.
3. Give an easy-to-remember name to your edge firewall.
4. Select the domains you want to protect with the function.
5. Enable the **Edge Functions** switch in the **Edge Firewall Modules** section.
6. Click the **Save** button.

Done. Now you've instantiated the edge firewall for your integration and it has access to edge functions.

### Setting up the function

While still on the **Edge Firewall** page:

1. Select the **Functions** tab.
2. Click the **Add Function** button.
3. Give an easy-to-remember name to your instance.
4. On the dropdown menu, select the **Fingerprint** function.

This action will load the function, showing a form with the function code and, just above it, two tabs: **Code** and **Args**.

By clicking the **Code** tab, you'll be able to navigate through the source code but not to change it.

On the **Args** tab, you'll pass your variables. In this case, you must declare only the variables that you want the function **to ignore**, as an **array of strings**. It isn't a required action. If blank, the function will collect all the data.

```json
{
  "fingerprint_ignore": []
}
```

To understand how to configure the integration, contact the Azion [support team](/en/documentation/services/support/#service-channels) and request the solution documentation.

:::note
Any variable as `null` or blank will still be a valid value.
:::

5. When you're done, click the **Save** button.

### Setting up the Rules Engine

To finish, you have to set up a **Rules Engine** to configure the *criteria* and the *behavior* to run the function.

Still in the **Edge Firewall** page:

1. Select the **Rules Engine** tab.
2. Click the **New Rule** button.
3. Give an easy-to-remember name to the rule.
   - You can add a description, but it's an optional step.
4. Select a *criteria* to run and catch the domains that you want to run the integration on.
5. Below, select a *behavior* to the *criteria*. In this case, it'll be **Run Function**.
6. Select the adequate function according to the name you gave it in the instantiate step.
7. Click the **Save** button.

Done. You now have you can collect session data by using Azion **Fingerprint**.
