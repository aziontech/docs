The **Hello World** function is a simple program often used to introduce beginners to a new programming language or development environment. As a result, the message `Hello, world!` is usually displayed on the screen or console.

The Hello World is a simple and easy-to-understand example to show the basic syntax and structure of some programming languages. The specific implementation of a “Hello World” function or program will differ depending on the programming language and/or framework used.

Azion Hello World is a *serverless* integration available at Azion Marketplace. It'll be used to show how the edge technology works, by displaying a message, *Hello World*, on your browser using an edge application.

## How to install the Hello World integration

To use the **Hello World** integration provided by **Azion Marketplace**, you have to:

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Marketplace**.
2. On the Marketplace homepage, select the integration's card.
    - You can search any integration by browsing through the cards, using the filters, or typing a keyword in the search bar.
3. Once the integration's page opens, click the **Install** button and you'll see the screen to start the installation journey.

:::note
If you don't have an edge application, you must [create your first one](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/overview/). Then, go back to the **Marketplace** homepage and restart the installation process.

To install the integration, follow the steps:

1. On the **Select an edge application** section, open the **Edge Application** dropdown menu.
    - It'll show a list with all your edge applications.
2. Select the one you want to install the **Hello World** integration in
3. In the **General** section, you'll fill the arguments needed to instantiate the Hello World integration: `Status` and `Body`.
    - On the `Status` field, you must pass the HTTP status code. For example, the default value is `200`, which indicates that the request was successful.
    - For the `Body` field, you can pass any string you want. This is the text that will be shown on the screen once your edge application is ready. The default value is `Hello World!`.
4. Finally, you can check the [permissions required by the Marketplace](/en/documentation/products/marketplace/permissions-marketplace/) to update the selected application.
    - In this case, permissions to `Read and write the selected edge application` and `Delete the functions to instantiate the new integration in the selected edge application`.
5. Click the **Deploy** button.

A message will appear to confirm the integration was successfully installed.
