The **Hello World** function is a simple program often used to introduce beginners to a new programming language or development environment. As a result, the message `Hello, world!` is usually displayed on the screen or console.

The Hello World is a simple and easy-to-understand example to show the basic syntax and structure of some programming languages. The specific implementation of a “Hello World” function or program will differ depending on the programming language and/or framework used.

Azion Hello World is a *serverless* integration available at Azion Marketplace. It'll be used to show how the edge technology works, by displaying a message, *Hello World*, on your browser using an edge application.

    - This integration has two Args: `Status` and `Body`.
    - On the `Status` field, you have to pass the HTTP status code. For example, the default value is `200`, which indicates that the request was successful.

5. With the installation process finished, the screen will close and you'll see the green box on the top of the integration's homepage with the message `Your solution was successfully installed. Check the Overview and Usage Information sections for more details`, followed by a yellow box with the message `This solution was installed within a new disabled rule in your edge application. On your edge application management, under the Rules Engine tab, you may enable it`.
    - The green box indicates that the integration was successfully installed and you can find more information about the integration and the next steps on these two sections of the integration's homepage.
    - The yellow box indicates that you need to: access your edge application's **Main Settings** > select the **Rules Engine** tab > enable the generated rule. You have to perform these actions to put the new **Hello World** integration on the edge on a different path of the main application.

Done. You just have to wait until the integration's configuration propagates through Azion's edge nodes.
