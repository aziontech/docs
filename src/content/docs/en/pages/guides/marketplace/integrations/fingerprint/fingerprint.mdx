Azion **Fingerprint** enables you to capture devices and network data to better identify devices accessing your applications. It can be classified as a *Session Fingerprinting* integration and captures some browser-related data, alongside connection data, to generate a unique identifier and add it as a request header.

This integration includes two features:

- A **browser-level script** (optional): a [JavaScript code](#embedding-the-script) that could be added to the web page. It captures data about the browser and sets it as a session cookie (named `_azfp_sc`), so this data is always sent by the browser. Even when the usage of this script is optional, it increases the precision of the integration.
- An **edge function** (mandatory): a function to capture connection-related data as well as the "frontend fingerprint" (created by the browser script), when available, to create the session fingerprint. It'll then add this fingerprint as a request header (named `X-AZFP`).

---

## Embedding the script

The browser script is a JavaScript code that runs in the web page you want to fingerprint. It captures multiple data from the web browser:

- Audio and video support
- Canvas renderization
- If the browser has access to device-level API, such as accelerometer and gyroscope
- Manufacturer's data
- Timezone
- WebGL renderization

Then, it creates a unique identifier containing all this information and sets it as a session cookie named `_azfp_sc`, as cookies are always sent in the requests made by the browser. The script checks if the session cookie already exists. If so, it won't create a new one..

You need to embed the whole code in the browser. To do so, proceed as follows:

1. Copy the whole code include in this [repository]().
2. Create a new JavaScript file in your project and paste the sript code.
3. Open the the main index for your web page. Example: `index.html`.
4. Call the new JavaScript file to run the script code on the browser.

:::note
It's a modularized script, in order to avoid collateral damage in any other scripts that might be running in the same web page.

## Getting the integration

To install Azion **Fingerptint**:

1. Access [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/) > **Marketplace**.
2. On the Marketplace's homepage, select the integration's card.
3. Once the integration's page opens, click the **Get It Now** button, at the bottom-right corner of the page.

A successful message appears to confirm your integration is installed.

:::tip
You can search any integration by browsing through the cards or typing a keyword in the search bar.

## Configuring the integration

### Setting up the Edge Firewall

To do so, follow the steps:

1. On the upper-left corner, select **Products menu** > **Edge Firewall** in the **SECURE** section.
2. Click the **Add Rule Set** button.
3. Give an easy-to-remember name to your new rule.
4. Select the domains you want to protect with the function.
5. Enable the **Edge Functions** switch in the **Edge Firewall Modules** section.
6. Click the **Save** button.

Done. Now you've instantiated the rule for your function and have access to edge functions on your edge firewall.

### Setting up the function

While still on the **Edge Firewall** page:

1. Select the **Functions** tab.
2. Click the **Add Function** button.
3. Give an easy-to-remember name to your instance.
4. On the dropdown menu, select the **Fingerptint** function.

This action will load the function, showing a form with the function code and, just above it, two tabs: **Code** and **Args**.

By clicking the Code tab, you'll be able to navigate through the source code but not to change it.

The following data is used to create the fingerprint hash:

- Autonomous System Numbers (ASN)
- Cookie `_azfp_sc`
- Geoip City Code
- Geoip Country Code
- Geoip Region Code
- Header Accept
- Header Accept-CH
- Header Accept-Encoding
- Header Accept-Language
- Header User-Agent
- Header X-Forwarded-For
- Remote Address
- SSL Cipher
- SSL Version

On the **Args** tab, you'll pass your variables. In this case, you must declare just the variables that you want the function **to ignore**, as an **array of strings**. It's a not required action. If blank, the function will collect all the data.

```json
{
  "fingerprint_ignore": []
}
```

Possible variables to be ignored in the creation of the fingerprint:

- `cookie_fingerprint`: the cookie created by the [browser script](#embedding-the-script), named `_azfp_sc`
- `header_accept`: the content types the client can understand. Example: `text/html`
- `header_accept_ch`: the client hints headers a client should include in subsequent requests. Exmaple: `Viewport-Width, Width`
- `header_accept_encoding`: the encoding algorithms a client supports. Example: `gzip`
- `header_accept_language`: the language client prefers. Example: `"en-US"`
- `header_user_agent`: the software and version the client uses. Example: `Chrome/51.0.2704.106`
- `geoip_asn`: the ASN associated with the device's IP. Example: `52580`
- `geoip_city`: the city associated with the device's IP. Example: `"Brasilia"`
- `geoip_country_code`: the country code associated with the device's IP. Example: `"BR"`
- `geoip_region`: the region or state associated with the device's IP. Example: `"DF"`
- `remote_addr`: the device's remote IP address. Example: `000.0.0.0`
- `ssl_cipher`: the SSL cipher used in the device's connection. Example: `"ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256"`
- `ssl_protocol`: the SSL protocol used in the device's connection. Example: `"TLSv1.2"`

:::note
Any variable as "null" or blank will be still a valid value.
:::

5. When you're done, click the **Save** button.

### Setting up the Rules Engine

To finish, you have to set up a **Rules Engine** to configure the *criteria* and the *behavior* to run the function.

Still in the **Edge Firewall** page:

1. Select the **Rules Engine** tab.
2. Click the **New Rule** button.
3. Give an easy-to-remember name to the rule.
   - You can add a description, but it's an optional step.
4. Select a *criteria* to run and catch the domains that you want to run the integration on.
    - Use this rule: 
5. Below, select a *behavior* to the *criteria*. In this case, it'll be **Run Function**.
6. Select the adequate function according to the name you gave it in the instantiate step.
7. Click the **Save** button.

Done. You now have you can collect session data by using Azion **Fingerptint**.
