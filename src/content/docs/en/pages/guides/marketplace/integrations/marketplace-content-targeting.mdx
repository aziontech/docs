<InterfaceNote />

Azion **Content Targeting** is a *serverless* integration from Azion Marketplace.

This integration allows you to manipulate cookies and headers for flexible usage logics. This function can handle specific application contexts, business rules, or other customer-defined scenarios, as well as content segmentation.

You can create different scenarios and define variants and distribution percentages for each scenario using the Content Targeting integration. This allows a greater assertiveness without taxing resources and interactions at the source. Furthermore, you can create processing logic at the edge, broadening the function's application possibilities and reaping benefits such as targeted cache, absorption of access peaks, high performance, distributed processing logic, and event registration via Data Stream.

## Instantiating the integration

To enable this function, while still on the **Edge Application** page:

<Tabs client:visible>
    <Fragment slot="tab.console">Console</Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.rtm">Real-Time Manager</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.console">
1. Select the **Functions Instances** tab.
2. Click the **+ Function Instance** button.
3. Choose an easy to remember name for your function.
4. On the dropdown function menu, select the **Content Targeting [Global]** function.
  - This action will load the **Arguments** tab.
5. On the **Arguments** tab, add the parameters in a `JSON` file that will look like this:

```json
{
  "cookie_name": "azion-cookie",
  "header_name": "azion_header",
  "domain": ".azion.com",
  "max_age": 600,
  "expires": "Tue, 19 Jan 2038 03:14:07 GMT",
  "path": "/",
  "values": [
    {
      "value": "A",
      "weight": 7.1,
      "cache_key": "custom_a"
    },
    {
      "value": "B",
      "weight": 14.9
    }
  ]
}
```

Where:

| Key | Data Format | Required | Description | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `cookie_name` | String | Yes | Represents the cookie which will be used to store the chosen value | - |
| `header_name` | String | Yes | Represents the header which will be used to store the chosen value | - |
| `domain` | String | Yes | Defines the domain for which the cookie will be set | - |
| `max_age` | Integer | No | Defines how long (in seconds) the cookie value will be valid | While `max_age` and `expires` aren't require, it's highly recommend using at least one of them, otherwise the cookie won't be stored.<br /><br />Another important fact is that these field don't replace one another, in fact, the `expires` one is just a fallback for older browsers which still doesn't work with the `max_age` directive. |
| `expires` | String | No | Legacy way to define how long a cookie will be stored. <br /><br />When using this format you must input a complete date. | - |
| `path` | String | Yes | Defines the path to where the cookie will be valid | - |
| `values` | Object | Yes (the list must have at least one entry) | Describes each possible value to be chosen | `value` (required) represents the value which will be set in the cookie/header if this option is chosen.<br /><br />`weight` (required) defines the odds of the option being chosen.<br /><br />`cache_key` (optional) defines a custom cache key for the request whenever this option is chosen. |
</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.rtm">
1. Select the **Functions** tab.
2. Click the **Add Function** button.
3. Choose an easy to remember name for your function.
4. On the dropdown function menu, select the **Content Targeting [Global]** function.

This action will load the function, showing a form with the function's code and, just above it, two tabs: **Code** and **Args**. Click on the **Code** tab and you'll be able to navigate through the code, but won't be able to change it. On the **Args** tab, you'll pass the integration parameters.

You'll pass the parameters via the **Args** tab in a `JSON` file that will look like this:

```json
{
  "cookie_name": "azion-cookie",
  "header_name": "azion_header",
  "domain": ".azion.com",
  "max_age": 600,
  "expires": "Tue, 19 Jan 2038 03:14:07 GMT",

    },
    {
      "value": "B",
