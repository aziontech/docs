## Setting up the integration

### Instantiating the edge function

To create an instance of the integration's function:

1. On the **Products menu**, navigate to **Build** > **Edge Application**.
2. Select the application from the list to which you want to add the integration or [create a new edge application](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/first-steps/).
3. Select the **Functions Instances** tab.
4. Click the **+ Function Instance** button.
5. Give a name to your instance.
6. On the dropdown menu, select the *Videoteca Player* function.
  - This action will load the **Arguments** tab, where you can add the parameters to execute your application.
7. In the **Arguments** tab, pass these parameters:


```json
{
"videoteca_user": "<your_username>", // Replace with your Videoteca username
"videoteca_token": "<your_token>", // Replace with your Videoteca API token
"custom_html": "<your_html>" // Replace with your custom html
}
```

Where:

| Variable | Required | Description |
| ---- | ----- | ----- |
| `videoteca_user` | Yes | The name of the account from which the function will retrieve the videos |
| `videoteca_token` | Yes | The token to access the Videoteca's API |
| `custom_html` | No | Custom HTML for the page delivered by the function. It must include the tag `<!-- videoteca_iframe -->` in the HTML, as the function will replace it with the actual iframe of the video |

:::tip
You can get your token at: `https://<YOUR-USER>.videotecaead.com.br/Apidoc` replacing `<YOUR-USER>` with your actual Videoteca username.
:::

8. Click the **Save** button to save your configuration.
