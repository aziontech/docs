<Fragment slot="panel.console">

1. On the **Products Menu**, navigate to **Build** > **Edge Application**.

4. Click the **+ Function Instance** button.
5. Give a name to your instance.
6. On the dropdown menu, select the *Videoteca Player* function.

7. In the **Arguments** tab, pass the three parameters:


```json

"videoteca_user": "<your_username>", // Replace with your Videoteca username
"videoteca_token": "<your_token>", // Replace with your Videoteca API token
"custom_html": "<your_html>" // Replace with your custom html

| `videoteca_token` | Yes | The token to access the Videoteca's API. |
