Azion **Send Event to Endpoint** is a *serverless* integration available at Azion **Marketplace**. This integration enables you to stream request data to an HTTP endpoint, taking the request data and transmitting it to a user-defined endpoint via Javascript fetch API. 

The integration also permits you to specify what kind of data you wish to capture by editing a `JSON` file.

After sending the collected data, the integration allows the request to proceed through the Rules Engine.

## Getting the integration

To use the **Send Event to Endpoint** integration, you have to: 

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Marketplace**.
2. On the Marketplace homepage, select **Send Event to Endpoint** card.
3. Once the integration's page opens, click the **Install** button.

You'll see a message indicating that your integration was successfully installed.

:::tip
You can search any integration by browsing through the cards, using the filters, or typing a keyword in the search bar.

## Configuring the integration

### Setting up a firewall

To instantiate the **Send Event to Endpoint** integration, follow these steps:

1. Under **Products menu**, select **Firewall** in the **SECURE** section.
2. Click the **+ Firewall** button.
3. Give an easy to remember name to your firewall.
4. Turn the **Functions** switch on.
5. Click the **Save** button.

Done. Now you have instantiated the firewall for your function.


### Setting up the integration

To instantiate the **Send Event to Endpoint** integration, while still on the **Firewall** page:

1. Select the **Functions Instances** tab.
2. Click the **+ Function Instance** button.
3. Give an easy to remember name to your instance.
4. On the dropdown menu, select the **Send Event to Endpoint** function.
  - This action will load the **Arguments** tab.

The **Arguments** tab will load a `JSON` file that looks like this:

```json
{
  "metadata": ["remote_addr"],
  "headers": ["x-hello"],
  "body": ["message", "user.id"],
  "http_connection_args": {
	"endpoint": "http://example_api:3000/test",
	"headers": {
  	"Authorization": "FakeAuth",
  		"X-Provider": "Azion Cells"
	}
  }
}
```

**Where**: 

| Field | Required | Data Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `metadata` | No | Null or Array | Defines which metadata fields will be streamed.<br /><br />When `null` (or not set), all metadata fields will be streamed.<br /><br />If you don't want to stream any metadata, you must set an empty array `[ ]` as the value of this field. |
| `headers` | No | Null or Array | Defines which request headers will be streamed.<br /><br />When `null` (or not set), all request headers will be streamed.<br /><br />If you don't want to stream any header, you must set an empty array `[ ]` as the value of this field. |
| `body` | No | Null or Array | Defines which request body fields will be streamed.<br /><br />When `null` (or not set), all request body fields will be streamed.<br /><br />If you don't want to stream any body field, you must set an empty array `[ ]` as the value of this field.<br /><br />To filter multi-level fields, use the dot notation. For example, if you use the string 'user.name' here, the function will seek for the field 'name' within the object 'user' in the request body. |
| `connection_args` | Yes | Object | Defines the data that will be used to stream the request data.<br /><br />The URL to which the data will be posted is defined by the endpoint.<br /><br />The headers specify which headers will be included in the fetch request.<br /><br />An additional 'Content-Type: application/json' header will be used. |
| `s3_connection_args` | No | Object | Defines the arguments used to connect to the S3 bucket. |
| `s3_connection_args.full_host` | Only when using `s3_connection_args` | String | Defines the full host of the S3 bucket. |
| `s3_connection_args.region` | Only when using <br />`s3_connection_args` | String | Defines the region of the S3 bucket. |
| `s3_connection_args.access_key` | Only when using <br />`s3_connection_args` | String | Defines the access key to be used in the connection to the S3 bucket. |
| `s3_connection_args.secret_key` | Only when using <br />`s3_connection_args` | String | Defines the secret key to be used in the connection to the S3 bucket. |
| `s3_connection_args.file_path` | No | String | Defines the path where the file created by the function must be stored.<br /><br />Default value:<br /> `/` |
| `s3_connection_args.use_date_prefix` | No | String | When enabled, it'll include a sub-folder with the current date (in format YYYY-MM-DD) to the file path.<br /><br />Default value:<br /> `true` |

This integration will return a response with the data streamed in a `JSON` file that will look like this:

```json
{
  "body": {
	"field_a": <data>,
	...
  },
  "geoip_asn": <data>,
  "geoip_city": <data>,
  "geoip_city_continent_code": <data>,
  "geoip_city_country_code": <data>,
  "geoip_city_country_name": <data>,
  "geoip_continent_code": <data>,
  "geoip_country_code": <data>,
  "geoip_country_name": <data>,
  "geoip_region": <data>,
  "geoip_region_name": <data>,
  "headers": {
	"x-header-a": <data>,
	...
  },
  "remote_addr": <data>,
  "remote_port": <data>,
  "remote_user": <data>,
  "request_id": <data>,
  "request_url": <data>,
  "server_protocol": <data>,
  "ssl_cipher": <data>,
  "ssl_protocol": <data>
}
```

Notice how the `request_id`, `request_url`, and metadata fields will be delivered in the root of the `JSON` file, whereas the body fields and request headers will be sent in objects.

**Important**: you can also use a "catch-all" `JSON` Args file, like this:

```json
{
    "connection_args": {
        "endpoint": "http://example_api:3000/test", 
    }
}
```

### S3 output files

For each new function run, a new file will be produced in the given S3 bucket. The file will be named after the request ID that initiated the function. 

Example: if the `connection_args.file_path` parameter is set to `/my-data/` and the function is performed on May 9th, 2023, with the request ID `abcd-1234`, the resultant file will be saved at `/my-data/2023-05-09/abcd-1234.json`. If the `connection_args.use_date_prefix` parameter is set to `false`, the resultant file will be saved as `/my-data/abcd-1234.json`.

If there are no `http_connection_args` or `s3_connection_args` supplied in the JSON Args, the function doesn't have any valid connection arguments to utilize. Then, the request will be terminated, and a `JSON` error message will be sent to indicate the cause of the issue.

```json
{
  "error": "A001",
  "detail": "The function instance is missing or has invalid required arguments."
}
```

If the function is unable to connect to the HTTP endpoint or the S3 provider, the user request will be ignored. Regardless, an error log will be created, which the client may access via Data Stream.

For example, if an invalid access key is used, the following notice will be displayed:

```json
[Send event to endpoint] S3 connection error; 
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<Error>
	<Code>InvalidAccessKeyId</Code>
	<Message>The key 'DAKEY' is not valid</Message>
</Error>
```

At last, if you supply the correct connection options for both the HTTP endpoint and the S3 bucket, the function will deliver event data to both sources at the same time.

### Setting up Rules Engine

To finish, you have to set up the **Rules Engine** to configure the *behavior* and the *criteria* to run the integration.

Still in the **Firewall** page:

1. Select the **Rules Engine** tab.
2. Click the **+ Rule Engine** button.
3. Give a name to the rule.
4. Select a *criteria* to run and catch the domains that you want to run the integration on.
  - Example: if `Host` *matches* `yourdomain.com`.
5. Below, select a *behavior* to the *criteria*. In this case, it'll be **Run Function**. 
    - Select the adequate function according to the name you gave it during the instantiation step.
6. Click the **Save** button.

On the Console, you must now configure your domain so your firewall protects it.

7. On the **Products menu**, select **Domains**.
8. Click on the domain you want to protect with your Send Event to Endpoint function.
9. In the **Settings** section, click on the `Firewall` selector and choose the firewall you created.
10. Click the **Save** button.

Done. Now the **Send Event to Endpoint** integration is running for every request made to the domain you indicated.
