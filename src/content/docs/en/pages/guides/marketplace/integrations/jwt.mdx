Azion has two user interfaces: Real-Time Manager and Console, which is in *Preview* stage. Currently, Console is only available for Developer plans and new accounts. Follow the steps according to the user interface you're using.

JWT is a *serverless* integration available at Azion Marketplace.

Access tokens are often used to control access to online resources, such as APIs and media archives, and JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) can be used to simplify this process. However, JWTs can be larger than session IDs and affect network speed. You can solve these issues by using edge computing capabilities. 

Azion offers an integration for increased security: the JWT Edge integration runs directly on the edge firewall. This integration allows you to grant and revoke privileges using *KIDs* and *secrets*, and set expiration dates. It runs on the edge for added security as it verifies authenticity before reaching the infrastructure, without the need to contact an authenticator server, which speeds up the process.

## Configuring the integration

### Setting up an edge firewall

To instantiate the JWT Edge Function, follow these steps:

<Tabs client:visible>
    <Fragment slot="tab.console">Console</Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.rtm">Real-Time Manager</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.console">
1. On the upper-left corner, open the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, then select **Edge Firewall** in the **SECURE** section.
2. Click the **+ Edge Firewall** button.
3. Give a name to your edge firewall.
4. Select the domains you want to protect with the JWT Edge Function.
5. Click the **Edge Functions** switch.
6. Click the **Save** button.
</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.rtm">
1. On the upper-left corner, open the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, then select **Edge Firewall** in the **SECURE** section.
2. Click the **Add Rule Set** button.
3. Give a name to your edge firewall.
4. Select the domains you want to protect with the JWT Edge Function.
5. Click the **Edge Functions** switch to enable functions on your edge application.
6. Click the **Save** button.
</Fragment>

</Tabs>

### Setting up the Edge Firewall function

To instantiate the JWT integration, while still on the **Edge Firewall** page:

<Tabs client:visible>
    <Fragment slot="tab.console">Console</Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.rtm">Real-Time Manager</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.console">
1. Go to the **Functions Instances** tab.
2. Click the **+ Function Instance** button.
3. Give a name to your instance.
4. On the dropdown menu, select **JWT**.
  - This action will load the **Arguments** tab.
5. On the **Arguments** tab, add the parameters.

The **Arguments** tab will load an example of KIDs, similar to the one below:

```json
[{
  “kids”: {
    “4546D4AA7F62F01A833A7ABE354030E7": “D6CB2342E44EFB6DD628276F36DA2359”,
    “D6CB2342E44EFB6DD628276F36DA2359": “60BD8ED7A768E8BD6925BEB0A691AADB”,
    “60BD8ED7A768E8BD6925BEB0A691AADB”: “4546D4AA7F62F01A833A7ABE354030E7”
  }
}]
```

5. Click the **Save** button.

Done. Now you have your JWT instanced. 
</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.rtm">
1. Go to the **Functions** tab.
2. Click the **Add Function** button.
3. Give a name to your instance.
4. On the dropdown menu, select **JWT**.

This will load the function, showing a form with the source code of the integration and two tabs: **Code** and **Args**.

If you click on the **Code** tab, you can navigate through the source code to become familiar with it, but without making changes. On the **Args** tab, you can change the configuration of your JWT function.

Select the **Args** tab to open the form for the JSON **Args** where you can add the parameters to execute your application.

The **Args** tab will load an example of KIDs, similar to the one below:

```json
[{
  “kids”: {
    “4546D4AA7F62F01A833A7ABE354030E7": “D6CB2342E44EFB6DD628276F36DA2359”,
    “D6CB2342E44EFB6DD628276F36DA2359": “60BD8ED7A768E8BD6925BEB0A691AADB”,
    “60BD8ED7A768E8BD6925BEB0A691AADB”: “4546D4AA7F62F01A833A7ABE354030E7”
  }
}]
```

5. Click the **Save** button.

Done. Now you have your JWT instanced. 
</Fragment>

</Tabs>

### Setting up the Edge Firewall Rules Engine

To finish, you have to set up the [Rules Engine](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-firewall/rules-engine/) to configure the behavior and the criteria to run the JWT.

To do so, still on the **Edge Firewall** page, follow these steps:

<Tabs client:visible>
    <Fragment slot="tab.console">Console</Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.rtm">Real-Time Manager</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.console">
1. Go to the **Rules Engine** tab.
2. Click the **+ Rule Engine** button.
3. Give a name to the rule.
4. Select a criteria with the domain that will run the integration. For example: `if Hostname is equal xxxxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`.
5. Below, select the **Run Function** *behavior* to the *criteria*.
    - Select the adequate **JWT function** according to the name you gave it in the instantiate step.
6. Click the **Save** button.

Done. Now you have a JWT integration running for every request made to the domain you indicate.
</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.rtm">
1. Go to the **Rules Engine** tab.
2. Click the **New Rule** button.
3. Give a name to the rule.
4. Select a criteria with the domain that will run the integration. For example: `if Hostname is equal xxxxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`.
5. Below, select the **Run Function** *behavior* to the *criteria*.
    - Select the adequate **JWT function** according to the name you gave it in the instantiate step.
6. Click the **Save** button.

Done. Now you have a JWT integration running for every request made to the domain you indicate.
</Fragment>

</Tabs>
