JWT is a *serverless* integration available at Azion Marketplace.

Access tokens are often used to control access to online resources, such as APIs and media archives, and JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) can be used to simplify this process. However, JWTs can be larger than session IDs and affect network speed. You can solve these issues by using edge computing capabilities. 

Azion offers an integration for increased security: the JWT Edge integration runs directly on the edge firewall. This integration allows you to grant and revoke privileges using *KIDs* and *secrets*, and set expiration dates. It runs on the edge for added security as it verifies authenticity before reaching the infrastructure, without the need to contact an authenticator server, which speeds up the process.

## Getting the JWT integration from Azion Marketplace

To use the JWT integration provided by Azion's Marketplace, follow these steps:

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/) > **Marketplace**.
2. On the Marketplace homepage, select the integration's card.
3. Once the integration's page opens, click the **Get It Now** button, at the bottom-right corner of the page.

A successful message will appear. Now, your integration is installed.

You can search any integration by browsing through the cards or typing a keyword in the search bar.

## Configuring the integration

### Setting up an edge firewall

To instantiate the JWT Edge Function, follow these steps:

1. On the upper-left corner, open the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, then select **Edge Firewall** in the **SECURE** section.
2. Click the **Add Rule Set** button.
3. Give a name to your edge firewall.
4. Select the domains you want to protect with the JWT Edge Function.
5. Click the **Function** switch to enable functions on your edge application.
6. Click the **Save** button.

### Setting up the Edge Firewall function

To instantiate the JWT integration, while still on the **Edge Firewall** page, go to the **Functions** tab and follow these steps:

1. Click the **Add Function** button.
2. Give a name to your instance.
3. On the dropdown menu, select **JWT**.

This will load the function, showing a form with the source code of the integration and two tabs: **Code** and **Args**.

If you click on the **Code** tab, you can navigate through the source code to become familiar with it, but without making changes. On the **Args** tab, you can change the configuration of your JWT function.

Select the **Args** tab to open the form for the JSON **Args** where you can add the parameters to execute your application.

The **Args** tab will load an example of KIDs, similar to the one below:

```json
[{
  “kids”: {
    “4546D4AA7F62F01A833A7ABE354030E7": “D6CB2342E44EFB6DD628276F36DA2359”,
    “D6CB2342E44EFB6DD628276F36DA2359": “60BD8ED7A768E8BD6925BEB0A691AADB”,
    “60BD8ED7A768E8BD6925BEB0A691AADB”: “4546D4AA7F62F01A833A7ABE354030E7”
  }
}]
```

To save your *KIDs*, click the **Save** button.

Done. Now you have your JWT instanced.

## Setting up the Edge Firewall Rules Engine

To finish, you have to set up the [Rules Engine](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-firewall/rules-engine/) to configure the behavior and the criteria to run the JWT.

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Click the **New Rule** button.
2. Give a name to the rule.
3. Select a criteria with the domain that will run the integration. For example: `if Hostname is equal xxxxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`.
4. Below, select the **Run Function** *behavior* to the *criteria*.
    - Select the adequate **JWT function** according to the name you gave it in the instantiate step.
5. Click the **Save** button.

Done. Now you have a JWT integration running for every request made to the domain you indicate.
