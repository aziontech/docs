**Process Request Data Into Header** is a *serverless* integration available at Azion Marketplace. 

The purpose of this function is to stop a request whenever a request body field is empty. Using regex, the user can validate not only whether the field exists but also patterns. Additionally, they have the option to use any behavior they choose rather than a predetermined `Deny Request`.

## Configuring the integration

### Setting up an edge firewall

To instantiate the **Process Request Data Into Header** integration, follow the steps:

1. On the **Products menu**, select **Edge Firewall** in the **SECURE** section.
2. Click the **+ Edge Firewall** button.
3. Give an easy to remember name to your edge firewall.
4. Turn the **Edge Functions** switch on.
5. Click the **Save** button.

Done. Now you have instantiated the rule for your function.

### Setting up the integration

To instantiate the **Process Request Data Into Header** integration, while still on the **Edge Firewall** page:

1. Select the **Functions Instances** tab and follow these steps:
2. Click the **+ Function Instance** button.
3. Give an easy to remember name to your instance.
4. On the dropdown menu, select the **Process Request Data Into Header** function.
    - This function doesn't address any argument on the **Arguments** tab, but you can test it using the `curl` command.

### Curl command examples

| `curl -H "Content-Type: application /json" --request POST --data '{"my_data": {"abc": {"def": {"g": "xyz","h": false,"e": null}}, "number": 1}' https://mydomain/function`  | `X-Body-Error": "FD001"`                                                                             |

:::note
As long as the request has a valid `Content-Type` header and a valid request body, the integration converts the body fields into headers. This integration also supports nested object data. In this case, each "level" will be separated by a hyphen.
:::

#### Possible errors

This integration can trigger errors. In this case, the errors will be appended to a new header called `X-Body-Error`.

| Error Code | Description                                                                    |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CT001`    | The header `Content-Type` is missing or it's null |
| `CT002`    | The header `Content-Type` has a value, but it isn't supported by the function |
| `FD001`    | The request body isn't correctly formatted and couldn't be decoded |

## Setting up the Edge Firewall Rules Engine

To finish, you have to set up the [Rules Engine](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-firewall/rules-engine/) to configure the *behavior* and the *criteria* to run the integration.

Still in the **Edge Firewall** page:

1. Select the **Rules Engine** tab.
2. Click the **+ Rule Engine** button.
3. Give a name to the rule.
4. Select a *criteria* to run and catch the domains that you want to run the integration on.
  - Example: if `Host` *matches* `yourdomain.com`.
5. Below, select a *behavior* to the *criteria*. In this case, it'll be **Run Function**. 
    - Select the adequate function according to the name you gave it during the instantiation step.
6. Click the **Save** button.

On the Console, you must now configure your domain so your edge firewall protects it.

7. On the **Products menu**, select **Domains**.
8. Click on the domain you want to protect with your IP Process Request Data Into Header.
9. In the **Settings** section, click on the `Edge Firewall` selector and choose the edge firewall you created.
10. Click the **Save** button.

Done. Now the **Process Request Data Into Header** integration is running for every request made to the domain you indicated.
