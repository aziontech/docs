The Hello World function is a simple program often used to introduce beginners to a new programming language or development environment. As a result, the message `Hello, world!` is usually displayed on the screen or console.

The Hello World is a simple and easy-to-understand example to show the basic syntax and structure of some programming languages. The specific implementation of a “Hello World” function or program will differ depending on the programming language and/or framework used.

Azion's Hello World is a *serverless* solution available at Azion Marketplace. It'll be used to show how the edge technology works, by displaying a message, *Hello World*, on your browser using an edge application.

## How to install the Hello World the solution

To use the **Hello World** solution provided by **Azion Marketplace**, you have to:

1. Log in to your [Real-Time Manager (RTM) account](https://manager.azion.com/).
    - If you don’t have one yet, create an account [visiting the sign-up page](https://manager.azion.com/signup).
2. On the upper-left corner of the page, select **Products menu**, indicated by the three horizontal lines > **Marketplace**.
3. Select the search box and type *“hello”* or browse through the cards to find the Hello World solution.
4. Once you’ve found the Hello World card, select it to go to the solution page.
5. On the solution page, look for the **Subscribe for** section on the bottom-right corner.
6. Click the **Get It Now** button to start the process to install a new solution on one of your edge applications.

> **Important**: if you don't have an edge application installed, you'll be alerted to create one. Click the link **Click Here** to create an edge application. After you've created your first edge application, go back to the **Marketplace** homepage and restart the installation process.

Once you click the **Get It Now** button, you'll see the screen to start the installation journey.

To install the solution, follow the steps:

1. On the **Select an Edge Application** screen, select the **Edge Application** dropdown menu. It'll show a list with all your edge applications.
2. Select the one you want to install the **Hello World** solution in.
3. Next, you'll fill the Args needed to instantiate the Hello World solution.
    - For this solution we have two Args: `Status` and `Body`.
    - On the `Status` field, you have to pass the HTTP status code. For example, the default value is `200`, which indicates that the request was successful.
    - For the `body` field, you can pass any string you want. This is the text that will be shown on the screen once your edge application is ready. The default value is `It works`.
4. Finally, you'll have to give permissions to the Marketplace to access and modify your edge application.
    - Every solution will have different permissions needs.
    - The **Hello World** solution needs permission to read and write on your edge application's **Main Settings**, **Functions**, and **Rules Engine**.
5. With the installation process finished, the screen will close and you'll see the green box on the top of the solution's homepage with the message `Your solution was successfully installed. Check the Overview and Usage Information sections for more details`, followed by a yellow box with the message `This solution was installed within a new disabled rule in your edge application. On your edge application management, under the Rules Engine tab, you may enable it`.
    - The green box indicates that the solution was successfully installed and you can find more information about the solution and the next steps on these two sections of the solution's homepage.
    - The yellow box indicates that you need to: access your edge application's **Main Settings** > select the **Rules Engine** tab > enable the generated rule. You have to perform these actions to put the new **Hello World** solution on the edge on a different path of the main application.

Done. You just have to wait until the solution's configuration propagates through Azion's edge nodes.
