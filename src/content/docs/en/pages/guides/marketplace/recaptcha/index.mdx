reCAPTCHA is a CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) solution designed to protect websites from bots and automated scripts by using a challenge-response test to determine whether the user is a human or a machine.

Google maintains and owns reCAPTCHA. The Google's solution has been around for a long time and Google uses the data collected by reCAPTCHA to improve their services.

Along many features that you'll find with reCaptcha, it's possible to highlight the following:

- API integration, which allows website owners to implement reCAPTCHA on their site.
- Different types of challenges, such as image and audio-based challenges, that can be customized to the needs of the website.
- Security features, such as rate limiting and automatic blocking of suspicious traffic, which help to protect your assets against bots and automated scripts.
- Accessibility options for visually impaired users, such as an audio version of the challenge.

## Getting the solution

reCaptcha is a *serverless* solution available at Azion Marketplace. This type of solution is mainly used for protecting domains against bots. It allows you to monitor traffic in your website by using the Google Dashboard for reCaptcha.

2. On the upper left corner of the page, select **Products menu** > **Marketplace**.
3. Select the search box and type *“recaptcha”* or browse through the cards to find the reCaptcha solution.
4. Once you’ve found the reCaptcha card, select it to go to the solution page.

## Getting the keys on Google's reCaptcha site

To use the reCaptcha solution, you have to provide two keys: your `secret-key` and your `site-key`. 

To get these credentials, you'll have to register at Google. 

To do so, follow these steps:

1. Go to [Google reCaptcha admin dashboard](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha).
 - If you don't have a Google Account, you'll be prompted to create one.
2. Once you've signed-up to the reCaptcha account, you'll be redirected to the website register page.
3. On this page you have to fill in:
    - A label for your new reCaptcha site.
    - Which version of reCaptcha you want to use (you can choose from v2 or v3).
        - If you choose v2, you'll be prompted to choose what kind of test you want to apply on your website. The options are: "*I'm not a robot checkbox*", "*Invisible reCaptcha*", and "*reCaptcha Android*".
        > **Important**: keep in mind that the Azion Marketplace reCaptcha solution was conceived to work with the v2 invisible option.
    - For what domain you want to run the reCaptcha. Remember to ignore the `http://` or `https://` for the domain name.
    - You have to accept the reCaptcha terms of service.
    - You have to choose if you want to receive alerts from Google about your site, such as misconfigurations and others.
    - Once you fill in all the information, click the **Submit** button.
4. Now you have your site registered to use the reCaptcha. In the next screen, you'll receive your keys: `Site Key` and `Secret Key`.

These two keys will be used to configure the Azion's reCaptcha solution later on.

## Using the solution

### Setting up the Edge Firewall rule

To instantiate the reCaptcha solution, follow the steps:

1. Under **Products menu**, select **Edge Firewall** in the **SECURE** section.
2. Click the **Add Rule Set** button.
3. Give an easy to remember name to your new rule.
3. Select the domains you want to protect with the function.
4. Click the **Function** switch to enable functions on your edge application..
5. Click the **Save** button.

Done. Now you have instantiated the rule for your function.

### Setting up the Edge Firewall function

To instantiate the reCaptcha solution, while still on the Edge Firewall page, select the **Functions** tab and follow these steps:

1. Click the **Add Function** button.
2. Give an easy to remember name to your instance.
3. On the dropdown menu, select the **reCaptcha** function.

> After you select the solution, a **Code** box will be loaded. This is just for study and can’t be modified.

In the same box, you have another tab: the **Args** tab. On the Args tab, you’ll pass the credentials you've obtained on the Google reCaptcha page.

The Args tab will load a JSON file which looks like this:

```json
{
    "site_key": "site-key",
    "secret_key": "private-key",
    "expiration_in_seconds": 86400,
    "domain": ".azion.com",
    "after_check_redirect_url": "https://www.azion.com",
    "cookie_secret": "KEY_16_CHAR_LONG"
}
```

Where:
- `site_key`: the site key you've obtained at Google's reCaptcha page.
- `secret_key`: the secret key you've obtained at Google reCaptcha page.
- `expiration_in_seconds`: the time *in seconds* until the reCaptcha expires.
- `domain`: your domain.
- `after_check_redirect_url`: the URL you want to redirect after the user passes the reCaptcha test.
- `cookie_secret`: this cookie is generated by the function and used in order for the functions to not re-run. 

> Due to the algorithm used in cryptography, the `cookie_secret` key must have 16 or 32 characters.

4. Click the **Save** button.

Done. Now your reCaptcha instance is saved.

*Optionally*, you can pass other parameters to customize the messages you want on your reCaptcha and a custom HTML to render the challenge.

```json
{
    "custom_message": "My message",
    "custom_html": "<html>... <!-- azion_captcha -->  .. </html>"
}
```

Where:
- `custom_message`: it's a customized message you want to show to the users.
- `custom_html`: it's the customized HTML to render the reCaptcha challenge box.

## Setting up the Edge Firewall Rules Engine

To finish, you have to set up the **Rules Engine** to configure the *behavior* and the *criteria* to run the function.

Still on the **Edge Firewall** page, select the **Rules Engine** tab and follow these steps:

1. Click the **New Rule** button.
2. Give a name to the rule.
3. Select a criteria to run and catch the domain you want to run the solution on. Example: `if Hostname is equal xxxxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`.
4. Below, select a *behavior* to the *criteria*. In this case, it’ll be **Run Function**. 
    - Select the adequate reCaptcha function according to the name you gave it in the instantiate step.
5. Click the **Save** button.

Done. Now the reCaptcha solution is running for every request made to the domain you indicated.
