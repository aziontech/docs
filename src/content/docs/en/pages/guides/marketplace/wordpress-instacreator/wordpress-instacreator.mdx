**WordPress InstaCreator** is a template designed by Azion to enable the automated creation of a WordPress project from scratch.

This template sets up an edge application and its domain, along with a pre-configured set of common cache rules, cache rules for static files and images, and bypass routes. These configurations optimize your website's performance.

By employing [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/) and [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) infrastructure, you can implement a new project in the Azion Edge Platform and manage and run it on the edge.

---

## Requirements

The WordPress InstaCreator template employs Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure to work. To successfully create a project from scratch, you must have an AWS account to generate or retrieve your **AWS Access Key ID** and **AWS Secret Access Key**.

These credentials should be temporary and used solely for the purpose of running this template. You must also have the necessary permissions to create an **EC2 instance** and execute a **CloudFormation script** on the AWS platform.

For more details on AWS access keys, visit [AWS Account and Access Keys documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-appendix-sign-up.html).

---

## Getting the template

The WordPress InstaCreator template is available at Azion Marketplace.

To create a WordPress website from scratch using this template, proceed as follows:

1. Access [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).
- If you don’t have an account yet, create a new one [by visiting the sign-up page](https://manager.azion.com/signup/).
2. On the homepage, select the **Start with a template** option.
3. Find the **WordPress InstaCreator** card and select it.
4. Click the **Settings** tab to open the configuration form. 

---

## Setting up the template

In the configuration form, you must provide the information to configure your Azion application. Fill in the presented fields. 

Fields identified with an asterisk are mandatory.

- **Application Name** *: the name of your edge application. It's used to identify and manage your application within Azion's platform.
  - Use a unique and easy-to-remember name. If the name has already been used, the platform returns an error message.
- **MySQL username** *: the username for your WordPress database.
- **MySQL user password** *: the password associated with your WordPress database user.
- **MySQL Root password** *: the root password for your WordPress database.
- **AWS Access Key ID** *: the unique identifier that associates your AWS account with your credentials.
  - You need to generate or retrieve this information on your AWS Account.
- **AWS Secret Access Key** *: the secret key associated with your AWS Access Key ID.
  - You need to generate or retrieve this information on your AWS Account.

After completing all the information, click the **Next** button, located in the bottom-right corner. This will start the deployment process.

## Deploying your project to the edge

During the deployment, you'll be able to follow the process through a window showing off the logs. When it's complete, the *deployment* page appears, confirming the edge application for your project has been successfully created.

This page shows you the following sections:

   - **Access your Edge Application** section includes the link to visit and explore your edge application.
   - **Build Summary** contains the application's name and function.
   - **What do you want to do next?** provides recommendations regarding advanced options to enhance your edge application: **Customize Domain**, **Manage Edge Application**, **View Edge Application Metrics**, **View Edge Application Logs**, and the **Back to Home** button.

:::note
By clicking the link of the edge application, you can see how it looks on the browser. However, ​​it takes a certain time to propagate and configure the application in Azion’s edge locations. It may be necessary to wait a few minutes for the URL to be activated and for the application page to be effectively displayed in the browser.

### Key configurations

When you implement this template, the following processes are completed, as well as some key configurations are defined, in Azion Edge Platform:

- **Edge application creation**: an edge application is set up on Azion's platform, enabling the management of all your settings.
- **Domain setup**: a new domain is configured to provide access to your edge application. You can also set up a custom domain to run on this edge application.
- **Common cache rules**: a standard cache rule of *15 minutes* is established for the edge application. This helps to reduce server load and improve response times.
- **Image file cache rules**: a specific cache rule of *15 days* is set up for image files. This helps to speed up image loading times and improve overall site performance.
- **Static file cache rules**: a cache rule of *1 year* is set up for static files. This ensures that static content, like CSS and JavaScript files, is served quickly to the user.
- **Bypass routes**: routes are configured with BYPASS settings, meaning no caching rules are applied and the resource is fetched directly from the origin. This is useful for content that needs to be served in real-time or for dynamic content that changes frequently.

Additionally, deploying the WordPress InstaCreator template also involves automatically:

- Creating an EC2 instance on your AWS account.
- Executing a CloudFormation script.
- Setting up your project on WordPress.

To guarantee the optimal performance of this template, you must activate the following Azion products:
<Badge>
[Application Acceleration](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/application-acceleration/)
</Badge>
<Badge>
[Edge Caching](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-caching/)

:::caution[Warning]
You need to activate the products separately via RTM. Review the [Azion documentation](/en/documentation) to do so.

If these products are activated, the execution of this template could generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/) for more information.

Any cost generated by AWS and Amazon EC2 usage will be processed and billed separately on the AWS platform. Visit the [AWS documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/) for more details.

## Managing your project on Azion

Considering that this initial setup may not be optimal for your specific edge application, all settings can be customized any time you need by using Azion Real-Time Manager (RTM).

To manage and edit your edge application's settings, follow these steps:

1. [Access RTM](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. On the upper-left corner, select the three horizontal lines to open the **Products menu**.
3. In the **BUILD** section, select **Edge Application**. You'll be redirected to the **Edge Application** page.
- It lists all the edge applications you've created. 
4. Find the edge application related to your WordPress website and select it. 
- The list is organized alphabetically. You can also use the **search bar** located in the upper-left corner of the list; currently, it filters only by **Application Name**.

After selecting the edge application you’ll work on, you’re directed to a page containing all the settings you can configure.

Additionally, once the template is deployed, you also have full control over customizing your website's design, content, and functionality using the WordPress admin panel.

:::tip
Read the documentation about [managing edge applications](/en/documentation/products/getting-started/#settings-app) for more details. For specific WordPress-related questions, check [WordPress official](https://wordpress.com/) channels.

### Adding a custom domain

The edge application created during the deployment has an assigned Azion domain to make it accessible through the browser. The domain has the following format: `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/`. However, you can add a custom domain for users to access your edge application through it.
