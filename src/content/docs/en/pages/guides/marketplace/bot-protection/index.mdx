The Azion **Bot Protection** is a *serverless* solution available at **Azion Marketplace**. It analyzes incoming requests using an edge function running on Edge Firewall and assigns a score based on rules and behaviors. If the score exceeds a predetermined threshold, the solution declines or cancels the request. 

Using advanced algorithms that analyze the behavior of incoming data, they can detect and prevent malicious activities such as credential stuffing, vulnerability scanning, and site scraping. The system employs Reputation Intelligence to establish a profile of each person who visits the site, including location, device kind, and browsing patterns, allowing for instant identification of suspicious behavior and preventative actions against prospective assaults.

## Getting the solution

To obtain the solution, follow these steps:

1. Access [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/) and log into your account.

3. On the upper-left corner of the RTM homepage, open the **Products menu**, indicated by the three horizontal lines, and select **Marketplace**.

2. Click the **Add Rule Set** button.
3. Give an easy-to-remember name to your new rule.
4. Select the domains you want to protect with the function.
5. Click the **Save** button.

Done. Now you've instantiated the rule for your function.

### Setting up the Edge Firewall function 

You need to enable the **Edge Functions** switch to instantiate the solutions. To do so, follow these steps:

1. On the **Main Settings** tab, look for the **Edge Functions** switch.
2. Turn it on and then click the **Save** button.

1. Click the **Add Function** button.
2. Give an easy-to-remember name to your instance.
3. On the dropdown menu, select the **Azion Bot Protection** function.

### Integrate SIEM

If you require the Bot Protection logs, you may join a SIEM platform to obtain full data. To do so, update the JSON ARGS of the Bot Protection function solution and put in the SIEM connection data.

#### SIEM connection example

```json
{
"siem_integration": true,
  "send_data_to_siem_when": "always",
  "siem_connection_args": {
    "host": "requestinspector.com",
    "uri": "/inspect/01g43ftztkqgvcr65pjwbr0227",
    "port": "443",
    "scheme": "https",
    "additional_headers": {
      "Authorization": "secret123"
      }
   }
}
```

#### Log Example:

```json
{
  "geoip_region": "SP",
  "action": "deny",
  "asn": "396982",
  "request_id": "9581e2b51b5a082b12fed308f4eae564",
  "host": "ojgayey.map.azionedge.com",
  "classified": "bad bot",
  "geoip_country": "BR",

  ],
  "request_uri": "/a",
  "remote_addr": "34.95.175.91",
  "score": 8
}
```

### Setting up the Rules Engine

To finish, you have to set up a **Rules Engine** to configure the *behavior* and the *criteria* to run the function.

Still in the **Edge Firewall** page, select the **Rules Engine** tab and follow these steps:

1. Click the **New Rule** button.
2. Give an easy-to-remember name to the rule.
3. Select a *criteria* to run and catch the domains that you want to run the solution on. 
    - Use this rule: `if Request URI does not match "\.(png|jpg|css|js|jpeg|gif|ico|ttf|svg|woff|woff2|ashx|asmx|svc|swf|otf|eot)(\?.*)?$"`
        - This rule is necessary to exclude all static data on your application.
4. You have to create another criteria for this solution to work: `if Request URI does not match /.well-know/`
    - This rule is necessary to create a list of allowed IPs that doesn't impact automation or scripts to WEB API.
5. Below, select the **Run Function** *behavior* to the *criteria*.
  - Select the **Azion Bot Protection** function according to the name you gave it before.
6. Click the **Save** button.

Done. You now have your edge application protected against bot attacks by using the **Azion Bot Protection** solution.
