The **QStash EdgeFunction Scheduler** template is designed to set up and manage a custom edge function, which receives a user-configured schedule and dispatches it through [QStash](https://upstash.com/docs/qstash/overall/getstarted), a message queue and task scheduler for serverless runtimes.

---

## Requirements

Before using this template, you need to:

1. Create an [Upstash account](https://console.upstash.com/login).
2. In the [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/qstash), get your **Current Signing Key**, **Next Signing Key**, and **QStash Token** within the **QStash** tab.
3. Generate your **GitHub personal token**.

:::tip
While generating your GitHub personal token, grant that your scope has the permissions to authorize an OAuth app or a personal token to access to public and private repositories, including read and write access to code. You must also enable the workflow option to allow adding and updating GitHub Actions workflow files.

Note that permissions can be scoped either to a user or an organization or to a repository. Read the [Creating a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) documentation for more information.

## Getting the template

To start using the **QStash EdgeFunction Scheduler** template, proceed as follows:

1. Access [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).
  - If you don’t have an account yet, create a new one [by visiting the sign-up page](https://manager.azion.com/signup/).
2. On the homepage, select the **Start with a template** option.
3. Find the **QStash EdgeFunction Scheduler** card and select it.
4. Click the **Settings** tab to open the configuration section. 

---

## Setting up the template

In the configuration form, you must provide the information to configure your Azion application. Fill in the presented fields.

Fields identified with an asterisk are mandatory.

- **Application Name** *: the name of your edge application. It's used to identify and manage your application within Azion's platform.
  - Use a unique and easy-to-remember name. If the name has already been used, the platform returns an error message.
- **QStash Current Signing Key** *: a string to sign all messages sent to the destination.
  - Go to your Upstash Console and copy the `QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY` from the **Qstash** tab.
- **QStash Next Signing Key** *: a string used to sign messages after you've rotated your signing keys.
  - Go to your Upstash Console and copy the `QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY` from the **Qstash** tab.
- **GitHub Personal Token** *: your GitHub personal token.

After completing all the information, click the **Next** button, located in the bottom-right corner. This will start the deployment process.

---

## Deploying the template

During the deployment, you'll be able to follow the process through a window showing off the logs. When it's complete, the *deployment* page appears, confirming the edge application has been successfully created.

:::tip
Copy and save the domain of your application provided in this stage. You'll need it to [schedule your tasks](#scheduling-tasks) later. If you want to use your own domain, review the [Adding a custom domain](#adding-a-custom-domain) section.
:::

This page shows you the following sections:

   - **Access your Edge Application** section includes the link to visit and explore your edge application.
   - **Build Summary** contains the application's name and function.
   - The **Deployment details** tab can be opened to access the logs related to the deployment. 
   - **What do you want to do next?** provides recommendations regarding advanced options to enhance your edge application: **Customize Domain**, **Manage Edge Application**, **View Edge Application Metrics**, **View Edge Application Logs**, and the **Back to Home** button.

:::note
By clicking the link of the edge application, you can view how it looks on the browser. However, ​​it takes a certain time to propagate and configure the application in Azion’s edge locations. It may be necessary to wait a few minutes for the URL to be activated and for the application page to be effectively displayed in the browser.
:::

### Key configurations

When deployed, this template creates an edge function built with the arguments provided by the user. It also creates a new GitHub repository that includes an automation to enable [continuous deployment](#continuous-deployment). Additionally, the template creates and instantiates an edge application and its domain to ease the interaction with the edge function.

Moreover, to guarantee the optimal performance of this template, the following Azion product must be activated in your account:

<Badge>
[Edge Functions](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-functions/)
</Badge>

You must activate this product separately via RTM. To do so:

1. [Access RTM](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. On the upper-left corner, select the three horizontal lines to open the **Products menu**.
3. In the **BUILD** section, select **Edge Application**.
4. You'll be redirected to the **Edge Application** page.
    - It lists all the edge applications you've created. 
5. Find the edge application related to your template and select it. 
6. In the **Main Settings** tab, find the **Edge Application Modules** section and enable the switch for the product you want to enable.

:::caution[Warning]
If these products are activated, the execution of this template could generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/) for more information.

Any cost generated by Qstash usage will be processed and billed separately on the Upstash platform. Visit the [QStash documentation](https://upstash.com/docs/qstash/overall/getstarted) for more details.

## Scheduling tasks

After the deployment is finished and propagated, you're able to start scheduling tasks.

:::note
The tasks must be scheduled in any format that can be transmitted in the HTTP request, such as JSON, XML, or binary. The examples below are using JSON.
:::

To do so, you have two options: [via terminal](#via-terminal) or [via Upstash console](#via-upstash-console).

### Via terminal

1. Get your application domain.
2. In the [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/qstash), copy the `QSTASH_TOKEN` from the **QStash** tab.
3. In your development environment, open the terminal.
4. Make an HTTP POST request to the specified URL to schedule your messages.

Use the following exemples for your request, according to the interval required:

#### Once

```bash
curl --request POST "https://qstash.upstash.io/v1/publish/{add your domain here}" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer {add your QStash token here}" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d "{ \"hello\": \"world\"}"
```

#### Every minute

```bash
curl --request POST "https://qstash.upstash.io/v1/publish/{add your domain here}" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer {add your QStash token here}" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Upstash-Cron: * * * * *" \
     -d "{ \"hello\": \"world\"}"
```

#### Every 10 minutes

```bash
curl --request POST "https://qstash.upstash.io/v1/publish/{add your domain here}" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer {add your QStash token here}" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Upstash-Cron: */10 * * * *" \
     -d "{ \"hello\": \"world\"}"
```

#### Every hour

```bash
curl --request POST "https://qstash.upstash.io/v1/publish/{add your domain here}" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer {add your QStash token here}" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Upstash-Cron: 0 * * * *" \
     -d "{ \"hello\": \"world\"}"
```

Where:

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--request POST` | Specifies the method of request sent. In this case, a HTTP POST method to post or schedule a HTTP message. |
| `-H "Authorization"` | Provides authorization information through a token for authentication. You must add your QStash token here. |
| `-H "Content-Type"` | Specifies the content type of the request body. In this case, JSON format. |
| `-H "Upstash-Cron"` | Schedules a cron-like job in Upstash, allowing you to automate tasks at specific intervals. |
| `-d` | Provides the data for the request body, including the JSON payload. The backslashes (`\`) before the double quotes (`"`) are used to ensure that the quotes are treated as part of the data within the JSON payload. |

Done. Your task is scheduled and will be executed according to the defined scheduling.

Your scheduled tasks are visible in the [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/qstash), within the **QStash** tab, for your review and monitoring.

### Via Upstash console

1. Copy your Azion application domain.
2. Go to the [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/qstash) and open the **QStash** tab.
3. Complete the form with the requested information.
  - In the type field, select **Scheduled** and choose the delay. 
  - Alternatively, select **Once** to send an immediate and unique message.
4. Click the **Schedule** button.

Done. Your task is scheduled and visible in the **Scheduled Jobs** section for your review and monitoring.

:::note
You can also publish them using a REST API request. For more information, read the [QStash documentation](https://upstash.com/docs/qstash/api/messages/create).

## Managing the template

Considering that this initial setup may not be optimal for your specific edge application, all settings can be customized at any time in Azion [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](http://manager.azion.com). Once the template is deployed, you also have full control over customizing your Upstash account and QStash configurations.

To manage and edit your edge application's settings, follow these steps:

1. [Access RTM](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. On the upper-left corner, select the three horizontal lines to open the **Products menu**.
3. In the **BUILD** section, select **Edge Application**.
4. You'll be redirected to the **Edge Application** page.
    - It lists all the edge applications you've created. 
5. Find the edge application relate to the Qstash Scheduler template and select it. 
    - The list is organized alphabetically. You can also use the **search bar** located in the upper-left corner of the list; currently, it filters only by **Application Name**.

After selecting the edge application you’ll work on, you’ll be directed to a page containing all the settings you can configure.

:::tip
Read the documentation about [managing edge applications](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/first-steps/) for more details. For specific Upstash or QStash-related questions, check the [Upstash documentation](https://docs.upstash.com/).
:::

### Continuous deployment

Once the template is deployed, you can edit and update your args and code, as well as implement a continuous deployment workflow. However, you'll first need to *declare secrets on your project's GitHub repository to complete the second build* with the changes. When the second build is completed, you'll be able to manage your project with a continuous deployment workflow and edit the args as desired.

To do so, open your **QStash EdgeFunction Scheduler** repository on GitHub. Then, go to **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Action** to [add your variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets), following these instructions:

1. Add the Azion personal token to the *secrets*:
    - Read [how to generate an Azion personal token](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/accounts/personal-tokens/) in the documentation.

```bash
    AZION_PERSONAL_TOKEN=<value>
```

2. Add the environments for use in the action workflow in the **main.yml** file, included in the **.github/workflows** folder of your repository:

```yml title=".github/workflows/main.yml"
  - name: edge-...
    id: azion_edge
    ...
    with:
        ....
        azionPersonalToken: ${{ secrets.AZION_PERSONAL_TOKEN }}
        ....

```

3. Add the Upstash Signing Keys to the *secrets*, being:

- **QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY**: a string to sign all messages sent to the destination.
- Go to your Upstash Console and copy the `QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY` in the **QStash** tab.
- **QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY**: a string used to sign messages after you've rotated your signing keys.
    - Go to your Upstash Console and copy the `QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY` from the **QStash** tab.

```bash
QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY=<value>
QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY=<value>
```

4. Add the environments for use in the action workflow in the **main.yml** file, included in the **.github/workflows** folder of your repository:

```yml title=".github/workflows/main.yml"
 - name: Create args file
    run: |
        ...
       "QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY": "${{ secrets.QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY }}",
        "QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY": "${{ secrets.QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY }}"
        ...
```

5. Open a pull request to merge the changes to the main branch and start the automatic deployment.

Now, your project is ready to work with a continuous deployment workflow, updating instantly any changes in the application or the repository. 

### Adding a custom domain

The edge application created during the deployment has an assigned Azion domain to make it accessible through the browser. The domain has the following format: `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/`. However, you can add a custom domain for users to access your edge application through it.
