The **HTMX Boilerplate** facilitates you to deploy and test a minimal example of the HTMX library in Azion Edge Platform. The deployment of this template will create a new edge function, a new domain, and an edge application, including the function instance and a default rule to run the instance.

Additionally, a GitHub repository is created in your account to manage the source code. The repository also includes a GitHub Action that ensures a continuous deployment workflow, keeping your project up to date.

## Requirements

Before deploying this template, you need:

- A [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) to connect with Azion and create your new repository.
  - Every push will be deployed automatically to this repository to keep your project updated.
- Enable **Edge Functions** and **Application Accelerator** in your account.
    - To do so, go to the [Billing & Subscriptions](/en/documentation/products/guides/billing-and-subscriptions/#subscriptions) section and activate the switch for each one.
    - If they aren't activated, the execution will fail and a log explaining the reason will be printed.
    - If they're activated, deploying this template could generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](/en/documentation/products/pricing/) for more information.

## Getting the template

To start using this template, access [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com/) and click the **+ Create** button on the homepage.

This will open a modal where you can select **Templates** > **HTMX Boilerplate** card.

---

## Setting up the template

In the configuration form, you must provide the information to configure your application. Fill in the presented fields. 

Fields identified with an asterisk are mandatory.

1. Connect Azion with your GitHub Account.
- A pop-up window will open to confirm the installation of the [Azion GitHub App](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/azion-github-app/), a tool that connects your GitHub account with Azion's platform.
- Define your permissions and repository access as desired.
2. Select the **Git Scope** to work with.
3. Define a name for your edge application.
- The bucket for storage and the edge function will use the same name.
- Use a unique and easy-to-remember name. If the name has already been used, the platform returns an error message.
4. Click the **Save** button to start the deployment process.

During the deployment, you'll be able to follow the process through a window showing off the logs. When it's complete, the page shows information about the application and some options to continue your journey.

:::note
The link to the edge application allows you to see it on the browser. However, it takes a certain time to propagate and configure the application in Azion's edge locations. It may be necessary to wait a few minutes for the URL to be activated and for the application page to be effectively displayed in the browser.

## Managing the template

Considering that this initial setup may not be optimal for your specific edge application, all settings can be customized any time you need through Azion Console.

To manage and edit your edge application's settings, proceed as follows:

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Edge Application**.
- You'll be redirected to the **Edge Application** page. It lists all the edge applications you've created. 
2. Select the edge application related to this template. 
- The list is organized alphabetically. You can also use the **search bar** located in the upper-left corner of the list; currently, it filters only by **Application Name**.

After selecting the edge application you'll work on, you'll be directed to a page containing all the settings you can configure.

:::tip
Read the documentation about [managing edge applications](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/first-steps/) for more details.

### Adding a custom domain

The edge application created during the deployment has an assigned Azion domain to make it accessible through the browser. The domain has the following format: `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/`. However, you can add a custom domain for users to access your edge application through it.
