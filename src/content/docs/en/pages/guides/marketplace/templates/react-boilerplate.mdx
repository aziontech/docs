The Azion **React Boilerplate** helps you build a **React Single-Page Application (SPA)** and run it directly on the edge of the network. By executing the boilerplate, several steps are automated, from repository management to edge deployment.

This template uses React version `18.2.0`.

---

## Requirements

- A [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) to connect with Azion and create your new repository.
  - Every push will be deployed automatically to this repository to keep your project updated.
- Enable [Edge Functions](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-functions/) in your Azion account.
    - To do so: 

1. Access [Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Account menu**.
2. Select the **Billing & Subscriptions** option.
3. Select the **Subscriptions** tab.
4. Activate the switch for the module.

:::caution[warning]
If a module is activated, the execution of this template could generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](/en/documentation/products/pricing/) for more information.

## Getting the template

To start using the **React Boilerplate**:

1. Access [Console](https://console.azion.com).
2. Click the **+ Create** button on the homepage.
3. In the modal, select the **Templates** option.
4. Browse and select the **React Boilerplate** card.

## Setting up the template

In the configuration form, you must provide the information to configure your application. Fill in the presented fields. 

Fields identified with an asterisk are mandatory.

1. Connect Azion with your GitHub account.
- A pop-up window will open to confirm the installation of the [Azion GitHub App](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/azion-github-app/), a tool that connects your GitHub account with Azion's platform.
- Define your permissions and repository access as desired.
2. Select the **Git Scope** to work with.
3. Define a name for your edge application.
- The bucket for storage and the edge function will use the same name.
- Use a unique and easy-to-remember name. If the name has already been used, the platform returns an error message.
4. Click the **Deploy** button to start the deployment process.

During the deployment, you'll be able to follow the process through a window showing off the logs. When it's complete, the page shows information about the application and some options to continue your journey.

:::note
The link to the edge application allows you to see it on the browser. However, it takes a certain time to propagate and configure the application in Azion's edge locations. It may be necessary to wait a few minutes for the URL to be activated and for the application page to be effectively displayed in the browser.

### Key configurations

With the integration of the [Vulcan framework adapter](/en/documentation/products/devtools/azion-edge-runtime/frameworks-compatibility/), the application undergoes an optimized build process, emphasizing optimal performance and efficiency.

The script creates a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aziontech/azion-samples/tree/dev/templates/reactjs-boilerplate) to manage the source code and then it installs all required dependencies. The template also includes a GitHub Action to enable continuous deployment.

The script also commits deployment details to the user's GitHub repository to maintain a transparent and trackable deployment history, including information related to the version deployed and the timestamp of the deployment.

Besides that, your application is deployed on the Azion Edge Platform and while carrying out multiple configurations, such as setting up the edge application and its domain to host your React project and an edge function for custom logic.

## Managing the template

Considering that this initial setup may not be optimal for your specific edge application, all settings can be customized any time you need by using Azion Console.

To manage and edit your edge application's settings, follow these steps:

1. [Access Console](https://console.azion.com).
2. On the upper-left corner, select **Products menu** > **Edge Application**.
- You'll be redirected to the **Edge Application** page. It lists all the edge applications you've created.
3. Find the edge application related to the **React Boilerplate** and select it. 
- The list is organized alphabetically. You can also use the **search bar** located in the upper-left corner of the list; currently, it filters only by **Application Name**.

After selecting the edge application you'll work on, you'll be directed to a page containing all the settings you can configure.

:::tip
Read the documentation about [managing edge applications](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/first-steps/) for more details.

### Adding a custom domain

The edge application created during the deployment has an assigned Azion domain to make it accessible through the browser. The domain has the following format: `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`. However, you can add a custom domain for users to access your edge application through it.

import LinkButton from 'azion-webkit/linkbutton';
