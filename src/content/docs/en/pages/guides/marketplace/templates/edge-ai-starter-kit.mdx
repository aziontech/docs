The **AI Inference Starter Kit** template contains the configurations for creating an AI-powered edge application that runs OpenAI-compatible APIs directly on Azion's distributed network. This template simplifies the deployment of AI models at the edge, eliminating origin dependencies and allowing you to quickly launch intelligent applications. 

The deployment of this template creates an edge application with an edge function and a domain to facilitate your access and management through Azion Web Platform.

---

## Requirements

- This template uses [Application Accelerator](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/application-accelerator/), [Edge Functions](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-functions/), and [AI Inference](/en/documentation/products/ai/ai-inference/), and it may generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](/en/documentation/products/pricing/) for more information.

---

## Deploying the template

You can obtain and configure your template through the Azion Console. To easily deploy it at the edge, click the button below.

<LinkButton
    label="Deploy"
    link="https://console.azion.com/create/starter-kit-ai-inference"
    icon="ai ai-azion"
    icon-pos="left"
  />

---

## Setting up the template

In the configuration form, you must provide the information to configure your application. Fill in the presented fields. 

Fields identified with an asterisk are mandatory.

1. Define a name for your edge application.
    - The bucket for storage and the edge function will use the same name.
    - Use a unique and easy-to-remember name. If the name has already been used, the platform returns an error message.
2. Click the **Deploy** button to start the deployment process.

During the deployment, you'll be able to follow the process through a window showing the logs. When it's complete, the page shows information about the application and some options to continue your journey.

:::note
The link to the edge application allows you to see it on the browser. However, it takes a certain time to propagate and configure the application in Azion's data centers. It may be necessary to wait a few minutes for the URL to be activated and for the application page to be effectively displayed in the browser.

## Managing the template

Considering that this initial setup may not be optimal for your specific edge application, all settings can be customized any time you need by using Azion's platform.

### Updating the edge function

This template includes an AI-enabled edge function that is ready to run. This function receives a POST request to the desired AI model and returns the response.

```ts
const modelResponse = await Azion.AI.run("ista-daslab-gemma-3-27b-it-gptq-4b-128g", {
  "stream": true,
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Name the european capitals"
    }
  ]
})
return modelResponse
```

This example uses the [Gemma3 model](/en/documentation/products/ai/ai-inference/models/gemma-3/). You can change the model and the request parameters according to your preferences. Check the [AI models reference](/en/documentation/products/ai/ai-inference/models/) for more information about the available models and how to use them in your application.

 Follow these steps to update the edge function according to your needs:

1. [Access Azion Console](https://console.azion.com).
2. On the upper-left corner, select **Products menu**, the icon with three horizontal lines, > **Edge Functions**.
3. Find the edge function related to your template and select it. It'll have the same name as your edge application.
    - The list is organized alphabetically. You can also use the **search bar** located in the upper-left corner of the list; currently, it filters only by **Function Name**.
4. On the edge function page, use the tabs to configure your function.
    - On the **Main Settings** page, you can rename the function and change some basic settings.
    - On the **Code** tab, you can update the function's code.
    - On the **Arguments** tab, you can define the arguments used by the function.
5. Click the **Save** button to save your changes.

### Managing the edge application

To manage and edit your edge application's settings, follow these steps:

1. [Access Azion Console](https://console.azion.com).
2. On the upper-left corner, select **Products menu**, the icon with three horizontal lines, > **Edge Application**.
    - You'll be redirected to the **Edge Application** page. It lists all the edge applications you've created.
3. Find the edge application related to your template and select it.
    - The list is organized alphabetically. You can also use the **search bar** located in the upper-left corner of the list; currently, it filters only by **Application Name**.
After selecting the edge application you'll work on, you'll be directed to a page containing all the settings you can configure.

### Adding a custom domain

The edge application created during the deployment has an assigned Azion domain to make it accessible through the browser. The domain has the following format: `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/`. However, you can add a custom domain for users to access your edge application through it.

import LinkButton from 'azion-webkit/linkbutton';

<LinkButton link="/en/documentation/products/guides/configure-a-domain/" label="Go to configuring a domain guide" severity="secondary" />
