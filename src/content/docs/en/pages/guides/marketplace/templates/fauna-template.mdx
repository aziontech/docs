The **Fauna DB Boilerplate** helps you to deploy and manage an application integrated with Fauna on the edge. The template includes the creation of a static interface to facilitate you to create, retrieve, update, and delete items in your collections.

---

## Requirements

Before using this template, you need to: 

- Create a [Fauna account](https://dashboard.fauna.com/register).
- Create a database in the [Fauna Dashboard](https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/get_started/dashboard) and populate it with `demo data`, selecting this option while creating.
- Create a new [collection](https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/cookbook/data_model/collections) named `Posts` within your database to use with this template. 
- Generate a [Fauna secret key](https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/v4/security/keys?lang=shell) for your database.
- Have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) to connect with Azion and create your new repository.
  - Every push will be deployed automatically to this repository to keep your project updated.
- Enable [Edge Functions](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-functions/) and [Application Accelerator](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/application-accelerator/) in your Azion account.
    - To do so: 

1. Access [Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/) > **Account menu**
2. Select the **Billing & Subscriptions** option.
3. Select the **Subscriptions** tab.
4. Activate the switch for each module.

:::caution[Warning]
If these modules are activated, the execution of this template could generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](/en/documentation/products/pricing/) for more information. 

Any cost generated by Fauna usage will be processed and billed separately on the Fauna platform. Visit the [Fauna documentation](https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/plan_billing/) for more details.

## Getting the template

To get the **Fauna DB Boilerplate**, access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/) and click the **+ Create** button on the homepage.

This will open a modal where you can select **Templates** > **Fauna DB Boilerplate** card.

---

## Setting up the template

In the configuration form, you must provide the information to configure your new application. Fill in the presented fields. 

Fields identified with an asterisk are mandatory.

1. Connect Azion with your GitHub account.
- A pop-up window will open to confirm the installation of the [Azion GitHub App](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/azion-github-app/), a tool that connects your GitHub account with Azion's platform.
- Define your permissions and repository access as desired.
2. Select the **Git Scope** to work with.
3. Define a name for your edge application.
- The bucket for storage and the edge function will use the same name.
- Use a unique and easy-to-remember name. If the name has already been used, the platform returns an error message.
4. Enter your **Fauna DB Secret Key** * to authorize the connection with your database.
5. Click the **Save** button to start the deployment process.

During the deployment, you'll be able to follow the process through a window showing off the logs. When it's complete, the page shows information about the application and some options to continue your journey.

:::note
The link to the edge application allows you to see it on the browser. However, it takes a certain time to propagate and configure the application in Azion's edge locations. It may be necessary to wait a few minutes for the URL to be activated and for the application page to be effectively displayed in the browser.
:::

### Key configurations

By deploying this template, the script creates:

- An edge application to run your project and manage all your settings.
- An Azion domain to access your edge application. You can also set up a custom domain to run on this edge application.
- An edge function containing custom logic.
- A GitHub repository for your project. The repository includes a GitHub Action that, by being activated, guarantees a continuous deployment workflow.
- A static interface, based on HTML, to manage the database.

---

## Managing your database collection

You can use the Azion domain to access it through the browser and interact with it through the static interface that was created.

By using this interface, you're able to **create**, **retrieve**, **update**, and **delete** items in your `Posts` collection, which is now linked to this new application. To do so, the interface provides an input area and icon buttons to manage your data as required.

All changes will be reflected on your application and your Fauna database as well. 

---

## Managing the template

Considering that this initial setup may not be optimal for your specific edge application, all settings can be customized any time you need by using Azion Console.

To manage and edit your edge application's settings, proceed as follows:

1. [Access Azion Console](https://console.azion.com/).
2. On the upper-left corner, select **Products menu** > **Edge Application**.
- You'll be redirected to the **Edge Application** page. It lists all the edge applications you've created.
3. Find the edge application related to the **Fauna DB Boilerplate** and select it. 
- The list is organized alphabetically. You can also use the **search bar** located in the upper-left corner of the list; currently, it filters only by **Application Name**.

After selecting the edge application you'll work on, you'll be directed to a page containing all the settings you can configure.

:::tip
Read the documentation about [managing edge applications](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/first-steps/) for more details.

### Adding a custom domain

The edge application created during the deployment has an assigned Azion domain to make it accessible through the browser. The domain has the following format: `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/`. However, you can add a custom domain for users to access your edge application through it.
