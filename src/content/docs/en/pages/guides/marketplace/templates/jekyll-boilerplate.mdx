The **Jekyll Boilerplate** accelerates the deployment of a basic Jekyll project, directly on the edge of the network.

This template deploys a repository with a project based on Jekyll, a framework written in Ruby, that enables you to create static sites using Markdown and HTML files. The repository also includes a GitHub Action to ensure a continuous deployment workflow, keeping your project up to date.

Additionally, the template deploys an edge application and a domain to facilitate your access and management through Azion Edge Platform. 

This template uses Jekyll version `4.3.3`.

## Requirements

- A [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) to connect with Azion and create your new repository.
  - Every push will be deployed automatically to the main branch in this repository to keep your project updated.
- Install [Ruby version 2.5.0 or higher](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ruby-101/).
  - Without a Ruby runtime environment, you won't be able to install the Jekyll gem or execute the Ruby code that powers Jekyll.

## Getting the template

To start using the **Jekyll Boilerplate**:

1. Access [Console](https://console.azion.com).
2. Click the **+ Create** button on the homepage.
3. In the modal, select the **Templates** option. 
4. Browse and select the **Jekyll Boilerplate** card.

## Setting up the template

In the configuration form, you must provide the information to configure your application. Fill in the presented fields. 

Fields identified with an asterisk are mandatory.

1. Connect Azion with your GitHub account.
- A pop-up window will open to confirm the installation of the [Azion GitHub App](/en/documentation/products/guides/azion-github-app/), a tool that connects your GitHub account with Azion's platform.
- Define your permissions and repository access as desired.
2. Select the **Git Scope** to work with.
3. Define a name for your edge application.
- The bucket for storage will use the same name.
- Use a unique and easy-to-remember name. If the name has already been used, the platform returns an error message.
4. Click the **Deploy** button to start the deployment process.

During the deployment, you'll be able to follow the process through a window showing off the logs. When it's complete, the page shows information about the application and some options to continue your journey.

:::note
The link to the edge application allows you to see it on the browser. However, it takes a certain time to propagate and configure the application in Azion's edge locations. It may be necessary to wait a few minutes for the URL to be activated and for the application page to be effectively displayed in the browser.

## Managing the template

Considering that this initial setup may not be optimal for your specific edge application, all settings can be customized any time you need by using Azion's platform.

To manage and edit your edge application's settings, follow these steps:

1. [Access Azion Console](https://console.azion.com).
2. On the upper-left corner, select **Products menu** > **Edge Application**.
- You'll be redirected to the **Edge Application** page. It lists all the edge applications you've created.
3. Find the edge application related to your template and select it.
- The list is organized alphabetically. You can also use the **search bar** located in the upper-left corner of the list; currently, it filters only by **Application Name**.

After selecting the edge application you'll work on, you'll be directed to a page containing all the settings you can configure.

:::tip
Read the documentation about [managing edge applications](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/first-steps/) for more details.

### Adding a custom domain

The edge application created during the deployment has an assigned Azion domain to make it accessible through the browser. The domain has the following format: `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/`. However, you can add a custom domain for users to access your edge application through it.

import LinkButton from '@aziontech/webkit/linkbutton';
