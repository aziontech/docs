The Azion **Angular Boilerplate** provides an automation solution to build an **Angular Single-Page Application (SPA)** and run it directly on the edge of the network, encapsulating several steps, from repository management to edge deployment.

This template uses Angular version `19.2.1`.

---

## Requirements

- A [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) to connect with Azion and create your new repository.
  - Every push will be deployed automatically to this repository to keep your project updated.


- This template uses [Functions](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/functions/) and it may generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/) for more information.

## Deploying the template

You can obtain and configure your template through the Azion Console. To easily deploy it at the edge, click the button below.

<Button

      href="https://console.azion.com/create/angular/angular-boilerplate"

      label="Deploy"

      type="primary"

      theme="light"

      icon="ai ai-azion"

      icon-pos="left"

    />

## Setting up the template

In the configuration form, you must provide the information to configure your Angular application. Fill in the presented fields. 

Fields identified with an asterisk are mandatory.

1. Connect Azion with your GitHub account.
- A pop-up window will open to confirm the installation of the [Azion GitHub App](/en/documentation/products/guides/azion-github-app/), a tool that connects your GitHub account with Azion's platform.
- Define your permissions and repository access as desired.
2. Select the **Git Scope** to work with.
3. Define a name for your application.
- The bucket for storage and the function will use the same name.
- Use a unique and easy-to-remember name. If the name has already been used, the platform returns an error message.
4. Click the **Deploy** button to start the deployment process.

During the deployment, you'll be able to follow the process through a window showing the logs. When it's complete, the page shows information about the application and some options to continue your journey.

:::note
The link to the application allows you to see it on the browser. However, it takes a certain time to propagate and configure the application in Azion's edge locations. It may be necessary to wait a few minutes for the URL to be activated and for the application page to be effectively displayed in the browser.

### Key configurations

The script creates a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aziontech/azion-samples/tree/dev/templates/angular-boilerplate) to manage the source code and then it installs all required dependencies. The template also includes a GitHub Action to enable continuous deployment.

With the integration of the [Azion Bundler framework adapter](/en/documentation/products/devtools/azion-edge-runtime/frameworks-compatibility/), the application undergoes an optimized build process, emphasizing optimal performance and efficiency.

Besides that, the script deploys your application on the Azion Web Platform and carries out multiple configurations, including setting up the application and its domain to host your Angular.js project and an function for custom logic.

To maintain a transparent and trackable deployment history, the script commits deployment details to the user's GitHub repository, including information related to the version deployed and the timestamp of the deployment.

## Managing the template

Considering that this initial setup may not be optimal for your specific application, all settings can be customized any time you need by using Azion's platform.

To manage and edit your application's settings, follow these steps:

1. [Access Azion Console](https://console.azion.com).
2. On the upper-left corner, select **Products menu** > **Applications**.
- You'll be redirected to the **Applications** page. It lists all the applications you've created.
3. Find the application related to your template and select it.
- The list is organized alphabetically. You can also use the **search bar** located in the upper-left corner of the list; currently, it filters only by **Application Name**.

After selecting the application you'll work on, you'll be directed to a page containing all the settings you can configure.

:::tip
Read the documentation about [managing applications](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/first-steps/) for more details.

### Adding a custom domain

The application created during the deployment has an assigned Azion Workload domain to make it accessible through the browser. The domain has the following format: `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/`. However, you can add a custom domain for users to access your application through it.

import Button from 'azion-webkit/components/Button';

<Button href="/en/documentation/products/guides/configure-a-domain/" label="go to configuring a domain guide" type="primary" theme="light" />
