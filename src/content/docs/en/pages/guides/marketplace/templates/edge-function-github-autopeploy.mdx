Azion **Edge Function GitHub AutoDeploy** is a template that allows you to deploy edge functions integrated with GitHub Actions directly on the edge of the network.

By using this template, you just need to create your edge function with an edge application, and the continuous deployment occurs through GitHub Actions. It accelerates your workflows and guarantees keeping your project up to date.

---

## Requirements

- A [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) to connect with Azion and create your new repository.
  - Every push will be deployed automatically to this repository to keep your project updated.
- Enable [Edge Functions](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-functions/) in your Azion account.
    - To do so: 

1. Access [Console](https://console.azion.com) > **Account menu**.
2. Select the **Billing & Subscriptions** option.
3. Select the **Subscriptions** tab.
4. Activate the switch for the module.

:::caution[warning]
If a module is activated, the execution of this template could generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](/en/documentation/products/pricing/) for more information.

## Getting the template

To start using the **Edge Function GitHub AutoDeploy** template:

1. Access [Console](https://console.azion.com).
2. Click the **+ Create** button on the homepage.
3. In the modal, select the **Templates** option.
4. Browse and select the **Edge Function GitHub AutoDeploy** card.

---

## Setting up the template

In the configuration form, you must provide the information to configure your new application, which will include the edge function. Fill in the presented fields. 

Fields identified with an asterisk are mandatory.

1. Connect Azion with your GitHub account.
- A pop-up window will open to confirm the installation of the [Azion GitHub App](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/azion-github-app/), a tool that connects your GitHub account with Azion's platform.
- Define your permissions and repository access as desired.
2. Select the **Git Scope** to work with.
3. Define a name for your edge application.
- The bucket for storage and the edge function will use the same name.
- Use a unique and easy-to-remember name. If the name has already been used, the platform returns an error message.
4. Click the **Deploy** button to start the deployment process.

During the deployment, you'll be able to follow the process through a window showing off the logs. When it's complete, the page shows information about the application and some options to continue your journey.

:::note
The link to the edge application allows you to see it on the browser. However, it takes a certain time to propagate and configure the application in Azion's edge locations. It may be necessary to wait a few minutes for the URL to be activated and for the application page to be effectively displayed in the browser.

### Key configurations

The application undergoes an optimized build process, emphasizing optimal performance and efficiency, employing **Azion Edge Platform** resources.

After the deployment, it creates a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aziontech/azion-samples/tree/dev/templates/edge-function-github-autodeploy) to manage the source code and then it installs all required dependencies and multiple configurations to set up the edge application, the domain to host your project, and an edge function for custom logic.

The script also commits deployment details to the user's GitHub repository, including information related to the version deployed and the timestamp of the deployment. The template also includes a GitHub Action to enable continuous deployment.

## Managing the template

To manage and edit your edge application's settings via Azion Console, follow these steps:

1. [Access Console](https://console.azion.com).
2. On the upper-left corner, select **Products menu** > **Edge Application**.
- You'll be redirected to the **Edge Application** page. It lists all the edge applications you've created.
3. Find the edge application related to the **Edge Function GitHub AutoDeploy** template and select it. 
- The list is organized alphabetically. You can also use the **search bar** located in the upper-left corner of the list; currently, it filters only by **Application Name**.

After selecting the edge application you'll work on, you'll be directed to a page containing all the settings you can configure.

:::tip
Read the documentation about [managing edge applications](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/first-steps/) for more details.

### Adding a custom domain

The new edge application has an assigned Azion domain to make it accessible through the browser, with the following format: `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`. However, you can add a custom domain for users to access your edge application through it.

import LinkButton from 'azion-webkit/linkbutton';

<LinkButton link="/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/domains/" label="go to Domains reference" severity="secondary" />
