**WordPress EdgeAccelerator** is a template designed by Azion that enhances your WordPress website, improving performance and security.

This template creates a new Azion application and domain, which enables you to manage your project on the edge. Additionally, it defines some key configurations to successfully deploy and implement the project, including common cache rules, image file cache rules, static file cache rules, and bypass routes. These configurations optimize your WordPress website's performance.

## Deploying the template

You can obtain and configure your template through the Azion Console. To easily deploy it at the edge, click the button below.

<LinkButton
    label="Deploy"
    link="https://console.azion.com/create/wordpress/wordpress-edgeaccelerator"
    icon="ai ai-azion"
    icon-pos="left"
  />

## Setting up the template

In the configuration form, you must provide the information to configure your Azion application. Fill in the presented fields. 

Fields identified with an asterisk are mandatory.

- **Application Name** *: the name of your application. It's used to identify and manage your application within Azion's platform.
  - Use a unique and easy-to-remember name. If the name has already been used, the platform returns an error message.
- **Origin Address** *: the address of your hosted origin. This information is crucial for the application to know where to fetch the original content from.
  - For example: `www.yourwebsite.com`.
- **Custom host header**: in some cases, it may be necessary to add host information in the header request to retrieve information from the origin. This variable is used for that purpose.
  - For example: `${host}`. Read more about the Host Header and how to customize it on the [Origins documentation](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/origins/). 

After completing all the information, click the **Deploy** button, located in the bottom-right corner. This will start the deployment process.

During the deployment, you'll be able to follow the process through a window showing the logs. When it's complete, the page shows information about the application and some options to continue your journey.

:::note
The link to the application allows you to see it on the browser. However, it takes a certain time to propagate and configure the application in Azion's edge locations. It may be necessary to wait a few minutes for the URL to be activated and for the application page to be effectively displayed in the browser.

## Managing your project on Azion

Considering that this initial setup may not be optimal for your specific application, all settings can be customized any time you need by using Azion Console.

To manage and edit your application's settings, follow these steps:

1. [Access Console](https://console.azion.com).
2. On the upper-left corner, select **Products menu** > **Applications**.
- You'll be redirected to the **Applications** page. It lists all the applications you've created.
3. Find the application related to your WordPress website and select it. 
- The list is organized alphabetically. You can also use the **search bar** located in the upper-left corner of the list; currently, it filters only by **Application Name**.

After selecting the application you'll work on, you're directed to a page containing all the settings you can configure.

Additionally, once the template is deployed, you also have full control over customizing your website's design, content, and functionality using the WordPress admin panel.

:::tip
Read the documentation about [managing applications](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/first-steps/) for more details. For specific WordPress-related questions, check [WordPress official](https://wordpress.com/) channels.

### Adding a custom domain

The application created during the deployment has an assigned Azion Workload domain to make it accessible through the browser. The domain has the following format: `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/`. However, you can add a custom domain for users to access your application through it.

import LinkButton from 'azion-webkit/linkbutton';

<LinkButton link="/en/documentation/products/guides/configure-a-domain/" label="go to configuring a domain guide" severity="secondary" />
