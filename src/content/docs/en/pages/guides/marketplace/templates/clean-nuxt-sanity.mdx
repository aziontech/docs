The Azion **Clean Nuxt + Sanity application** template creates a minimal [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) application with a [Sanity](http://sanity.io/) Studio, which is an open-source React application that connects to your Sanity project’s hosted dataset. The Studio is configured locally and can then be deployed for content collaboration.

This template uses Nuxt version `3.12.3`.

## Requirements

- A [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) to connect with Azion and create your new repository.
  - Every push will be deployed automatically to this repository to keep your project updated.
- A [Sanity.io](http://sanity.io/) account.
- This template uses [Application Accelerator](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/application-accelerator/), [Functions](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/functions/), and [Cache](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/cache/), and it may generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/) for more information.

## Deploying the template

You can obtain and configure your template through the Azion Console. To easily deploy it at the edge, click the button below.

<Button

    href="https://console.azion.com/create/sanity/clean-nuxt-sanity-app"

    label="Deploy"

    type="primary"

    theme="light"

## Setting up the template

:::note[important]

To start a blog project with Sanity, you have two options:

- **Sanity CLI**: create your project for free by selecting the blog template.
- **Sanity GUI**: the use of this option may incur costs. For more information, visit the [Sanity CMS](http://sanity.io/) website.
:::

In the configuration form, you must provide the information to configure your application. Fill in the presented fields.

Fields identified with an asterisk are mandatory.

1. Connect Azion with your GitHub account.
   - A pop-up window will open to confirm the installation of the [Azion GitHub App](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/azion-github-app/), a tool that connects your GitHub account with Azion's platform.
   - Define your permissions and repository access as desired.
2. Select the **Git Scope** to work with.
3. Fill in the information to setup the application:
   - **Application Name**: define a unique name for your application.
   - **Sanity Project ID**: project ID from which the content will be read.
   - **Sanity Studio Dataset**: dataset from which the content will be read. 
   - **Sanity API Read Token**: a security credential that provides access to read content from your Sanity dataset.
4. Click the **Deploy** button to start the deployment process.

During the deployment, you'll be able to follow the process through a window showing the logs. When it's complete, the page shows information about the application and some options to continue your journey.

:::note
The link to the application allows you to see it on the browser. However, it takes a certain time to propagate and configure the application in Azion's edge locations. It may be necessary to wait a few minutes for the URL to be activated and for the application page to be effectively displayed in the browser.

## Managing the template

Considering that this initial setup may not be optimal for your specific application, all settings can be customized any time you need by using Azion's platform.

To manage and edit your application's settings, follow these steps:

1. [Access Azion Console](https://console.azion.com).
2. On the upper-left corner, select **Products menu**, the icon with three horizontal lines, > **Applications**.
  - You'll be redirected to the **Applications** page. It lists all the applications you've created.
3. Find the application related to your template and select it.
  - The list is organized alphabetically. You can also use the **search bar** located in the upper-left corner of the list; currently, it filters only by **Application Name**.

After selecting the application you'll work on, you'll be directed to a page containing all the settings you can configure.

:::tip
Read the documentation about [managing applications](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/first-steps/) for more details.

### Adding a custom domain

The application created during the deployment has an assigned Azion Workload domain to make it accessible through the browser. The domain has the following format: `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/`. However, you can add a custom domain for users to access your application through it.

import Button from 'azion-webkit/components/Button';

<Button href="/en/documentation/products/guides/configure-a-domain/" label="Go to Configuring a Domain Guide" type="primary" theme="light" />
