**Hexo Boilerplate** facilitates you to build and run a *Hexo Single-Page Application (SPA)* directly on the edge by automating several steps, from repository management to edge deployment.

This template uses Hexo version `6.3.0`.

---

## Requirements

- A [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) to connect with Azion and create your new repository.
  - Every push will be deployed automatically to this repository to keep your project updated.
- Enable [Edge Functions](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-functions/) in your Azion account.
    - To do so:

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/) > **Account menu**
2. Select the **Billing & Subscriptions** option.
3. Select the **Subscriptions** tab.
4. Activate the switch for the module.

:::caution[warning]
If a module is activated, the execution of this template could generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](/en/documentation/products/pricing/) for more information.

## Getting the template

To use the **Hexo Boilerplate**, access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/) and click the **+ Create** button on the homepage.

This will open a modal where you can select **Templates** > **Hexo Boilerplate** card.

---

## Setting up the template

In the configuration form, you must provide the information to configure your application. Fill in the presented fields. 

Fields identified with an asterisk are mandatory.

1. Connect Azion with your GitHub account.
- A pop-up window will open to confirm the installation of the [Azion GitHub App](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/azion-github-app/), a tool that connects your GitHub account with Azion's platform.
- Define your permissions and repository access as desired.
2. Select the **Git Scope** to work with.
3. Define a name for your edge application.
- The bucket for storage and the edge function will use the same name.
- Use a unique and easy-to-remember name. If the name has already been used, the platform returns an error message.
4. Click the **Deploy** button to start the deployment process.

During the deployment, you'll be able to follow the process through a window showing off the logs. When it's complete, the page shows information about the application and some options to continue your journey.

:::note
The link to the edge application allows you to see it on the browser. However, it takes a certain time to propagate and configure the application in Azion's edge locations. It may be necessary to wait a few minutes for the URL to be activated and for the application page to be effectively displayed in the browser.
:::

### Key configurations

By deploying this template, through automation, the script creates an edge application along with an edge function and a GitHub repository for your project to manage the source code.

Your project carries out multiple configurations, including setting up the edge application and its domain to host your project and an edge function for custom logic.

The script also commits deployment details to the repository to maintain a transparent and trackable deployment history, including information related to the version deployed and the timestamp of the deployment. Besides that, the repository also includes all required dependencies and a GitHub Action that guarantees a continuous deployment workflow.

## Managing the template

Considering that this initial setup may not be optimal for your specific edge application, all settings can be customized any time you need by using Azion Console.

To manage and edit your edge application's settings, follow these steps:

1. [Access Console](https://console.azion.com).
2. On the upper-left corner, select **Products menu** > **Edge Application**.
- You'll be redirected to the **Edge Application** page. It lists all the edge applications you've created.
3. Find the edge application related to the Hexo Boilerplate and select it. 
- The list is organized alphabetically. You can also use the **search bar** located in the upper-left corner of the list; currently, it filters only by **Application Name**.

After selecting the edge application you'll work on, you'll be directed to a page containing all the settings you can configure.

:::tip
Read the documentation about [managing edge applications](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/first-steps/) for more details.

### Adding a custom domain

The edge application created during the deployment has an assigned Azion domain to make it accessible through the browser. The domain has the following format: `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`. However, you can add a custom domain for users to access your edge application through it.
