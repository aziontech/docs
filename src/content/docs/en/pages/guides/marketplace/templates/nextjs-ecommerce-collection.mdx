The **Next.js E-commerce Templates** collection offers configurations for building e-commerce applications using templates. These templates are all based on the **Next.js** framework.

The available templates are:

- **Ecommerce Stationery NextJs**: create a stylish e-commerce based on Next.js. It uses versions `13.4.6` of Next.js and `18.2.0` of React.
- **Kupingplug**: accelerate the deployment of your e-commerce based on TailwindCSS and Next.js. It uses versions `14.0.3` of Next.js, `18` of React and `3.3.0` of TailwindCSS.
- **NextJs Store Ecommerce**: deploy a new e-commerce project using Next.js, React, and TailwindCSS. It uses versions `12.2.1` of Next.js, `18.2.0` of React, and `3.1.5` of TailwindCSS.
- **Simple Ecommerce Next.js**: build a shopping cart with Next.js and Stripe integration. It uses versions `13.1.6` of Next.js, `18.2.0` of React, and `3.2.6` of TailwindCSS.
- **Space Jelly Shop**: build a new e-commerce site with Next.js, React, and TypeScript. It uses versions `13.1.6` of Next.js, 18.2.0 of React, and `4.9.5` of TypeScript.

The deployment process for each of these templates creates a GitHub repository for your project, along with an edge application and a domain. This setup enables easy access and management of your e-commerce application through the Azion Edge Platform.

## Requirements

- A [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) to connect with Azion and create your new repository.
    - Every push will be deployed automatically to this repository to keep your project updated.
- These templates use [Application Accelerator](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/application-accelerator/), [Edge Functions](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-functions/), and [Edge Cache](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-cache/), and could generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/) for more information.

## Deploying the template

You can obtain and configure your templates through the Azion Console. To easily deploy any of them at the edge, click the respective button below.

<LinkButton

## Setting up the template

In the configuration form, you must provide the information to configure your application. Fill in the presented fields. 

Fields identified with an asterisk are mandatory.

1. Connect Azion with your GitHub account.
    - A pop-up window will open to confirm the installation of the [Azion GitHub App](/en/documentation/products/guides/azion-github-app/), a tool that connects your GitHub account with Azion's platform.
    - Define your permissions and repository access as desired.
2. Select the **Git Scope** to work with.
3. Define a name for your edge application.
    - The bucket for storage and the edge function will use the same name.
    - Use a unique and easy-to-remember name. If the name has already been used, the platform returns an error message.
4. Click the **Deploy** button to start the deployment process.

During the deployment, you'll be able to follow the process through a window showing the logs. When it's complete, the page shows information about the application and some options to continue your journey.

:::note
The link to the edge application allows you to see it on the browser. However, it takes a certain time to propagate and configure the application in Azion's edge locations. It may be necessary to wait a few minutes for the URL to be activated and for the application page to be effectively displayed in the browser.

## Managing the template

Considering that this initial setup may not be optimal for your specific edge application, all settings can be customized any time you need by using Azion's platform.

To manage and edit your edge application's settings, follow these steps:

1. [Access Azion Console](https://console.azion.com).
2. On the upper-left corner, select **Products menu**, the icon with three horizontal lines, > **Edge Application**.
    - You'll be redirected to the **Edge Application** page. It lists all the edge applications you've created.
3. Find the edge application related to your template and select it.
    - The list is organized alphabetically. You can also use the **search bar** located in the upper-left corner of the list; currently, it filters only by **Application Name**.

After selecting the edge application you'll work on, you'll be directed to a page containing all the settings you can configure.

:::tip
Read the documentation about [managing edge applications](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/first-steps/) for more details.

### Adding a custom domain

The edge application created during the deployment has an assigned Azion domain to make it accessible through the browser. The domain has the following format: `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/`. However, you can add a custom domain for users to access your edge application through it.
