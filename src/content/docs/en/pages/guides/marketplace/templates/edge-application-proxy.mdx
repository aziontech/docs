**Edge Application Proxy** includes configurations that add a layer of engine rules to ignore all cache settings for a specific URL route. These configurations use a standard rule based on criteria and behaviors applied through Rules Engine for Edge Application.

The rule is composed by:

- **Criteria**: if `${uri}` *starts with* `/url_route`.
- **Behavior**: then [Set Origin](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/rules-engine/#set-origin) `Default Origin`, [Bypass Cache](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/rules-engine/#bypass-cache), and [Forward Cookies](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/rules-engine/#forward-cookies).

You must link your origin with the template to start using this set of rules. After the deployment, the script creates a new edge application that runs on **Azion's Edge Computing Platform**, with which you can manage and adjust the settings.

## Requirements

To use this template, you must activate:

<Badge>
[Edge Functions](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-functions/)
</Badge><br/>
<Badge>
[Application Accelerator](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/application-accelerator/)
</Badge>

You need to activate these modules via Azion Console. To do so:

1. Access [Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/) > **Account menu**
2. Select the **Billing & Subscriptions** option.
3. Select the **Subscriptions** tab.
4. Activate the switch for each module.

:::caution[warning]
If these modules are activated, the execution of this template could generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/) for more information.

## Getting the template

To use this template, access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/) and select the **Start with a template** option on the homepage.

This will open a new page where you can select the **Edge Application Proxy** card.

---

## Setting up the template

Once you're in the template's page, click the **Settings** tab to open the configuration form and provide the information to configure your application. 

Fields identified with an asterisk are mandatory.

- **Application Name** *: the name of your edge application on Azion.
    - Use a unique and easy-to-remember name. If the name has already been used, the platform returns an error message.
- **Origin Address** *: the address of the hosted origin the edge application should fetch the original content from.
    - Example: `www.yourwebsite.com`
- **Custom Host Header**: in some cases, it may be necessary to add host information in the header request to retrieve information from the origin. This variable is used for that purpose.
    - Example: `${host}`. Read more about the host header and how to customize it on the [Origins documentation](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/origins/#host-header).
- **Route to bypass** *: specific URL route to apply the bypassing rules.
    - Example: `/url_route`

After completing all the information, click the **Next** button, located in the bottom-right corner. This will start the deployment process.

---

## Deploying the template

You'll be able to follow the deployment process through a window showing off the logs. When it's complete, the *deployment* page appears, confirming the edge application has been successfully created.

This page shows you the following sections:

   - **Access your Edge Application** section includes the Azion domain to visit and explore your edge application.
   - **Build Summary** contains the application's name and function.
   - The **Deployment details** tab can be opened to access the logs related to the deployment.
   - **What do you want to do next?** provides recommendations regarding advanced options to enhance your edge application: **Customize Domain**, **Manage Edge Application**, **View Edge Application Metrics**, **View Edge Application Logs**, and the **Back to Home** button.

:::note
The link to the edge application allows you to see it on the browser. However, it takes a certain time to propagate and configure the application in Azion's edge locations. It may be necessary to wait a few minutes for the URL to be activated and for the application page to be effectively displayed in the browser.
:::

Now, you can you can manage and adjust the settings through this new Azion edge application.

## Managing the template

Considering that this initial setup may not be optimal for your specific edge application, all settings can be customized at any time by using Azion Console.

To manage and edit your edge application's settings, proceed as follows:

1. [Access Console](https://console.azion.com/).
2. On the upper-left corner, select **Products menu** > **Edge Application**.
- You'll be redirected to the **Edge Application** page. It lists all the edge applications you've created.
3. Find the edge application related to the **Edge Application Proxy*** template and select it. 
- The list is organized alphabetically. You can also use the **search bar** located in the upper-left corner of the list; currently, it filters only by **Application Name**.

After selecting the edge application you'll work on, you'll be directed to a page containing all the settings you can configure.

:::tip
Read the documentation about [managing edge applications](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/first-steps/) and [how to configure cache policies for Edge Application](/en/documentation/products/guides/cache-settings/) for more details.
