**Applications Proxy** includes configurations that add a layer of engine rules to ignore all cache settings for a specific URL route. These configurations use a standard rule based on criteria and behaviors applied through Rules Engine for Applications.

The rule is composed by:

- **Criteria**: if `${uri}` *starts with* `/url_route`.
- **Behavior**: then [Set Origin](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/rules-engine/#set-origin) `Default Origin`, [Bypass Cache](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/rules-engine/#bypass-cache), and [Forward Cookies](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/rules-engine/#forward-cookies).

You must link your origin with the template to start using this set of rules. After the deployment, the script creates a new application that runs on **Azion Web Platform**, with which you can manage and adjust the settings.

## Requirements

- This template uses [Application Accelerator](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/application-accelerator/) and [Functions](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/functions/), and it may generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/) for more information.

## Deploying the template

You can obtain and configure your template through the Azion Console. To easily deploy it at the edge, click the button below.

  <LinkButton
    label="Deploy"
    link="https://console.azion.com/create/azion/edge-application-proxy"
    icon="ai ai-azion"
    icon-pos="left"
  />

## Setting up the template

In the configuration form, you must provide the information to configure your application. Fill in the presented fields. 

Fields identified with an asterisk are mandatory.

- **Application Name** *: the name of your application on Azion.
    - Use a unique and easy-to-remember name. If the name has already been used, the platform returns an error message.
- **Origin Address** *: the address of the hosted origin the application should fetch the original content from.
    - Example: `www.yourwebsite.com`
- **Custom Host Header**: in some cases, it may be necessary to add host information in the header request to retrieve information from the origin. This variable is used for that purpose.
    - Example: `${host}`. Read more about the host header and how to customize it on the [Origins documentation](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/origins/#host-header).
- **Route to bypass** *: specific URL route to apply the bypassing rules.
    - Example: `/url_route`

After completing all the information, click the **Deploy** button, located in the bottom-right corner. This will start the deployment process.

You'll be able to follow the deployment process through a window showing the logs. When it's complete, the page shows information about the application and some options to continue your journey.

:::note
The link to the application allows you to see it on the browser. However, it takes a certain time to propagate and configure the application in Azion's edge locations. It may be necessary to wait a few minutes for the URL to be activated and for the application page to be effectively displayed in the browser.
:::

Now, you can you can manage and adjust the settings through this new Azion application.

## Managing the template

Considering that this initial setup may not be optimal for your specific application, all settings can be customized at any time by using Azion Console.

To manage and edit your application's settings, proceed as follows:

1. [Access Console](https://console.azion.com).
2. On the upper-left corner, select **Products menu** > **Applications**.
- You'll be redirected to the **Applications** page. It lists all the applications you've created.
3. Find the application related to the **Applications Proxy*** template and select it. 
- The list is organized alphabetically. You can also use the **search bar** located in the upper-left corner of the list; currently, it filters only by **Application Name**.

After selecting the application you'll work on, you'll be directed to a page containing all the settings you can configure.

:::tip
Read the documentation about [managing applications](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/first-steps/) and [how to configure cache policies for Applications](/en/documentation/products/guides/cache-settings/) for more details.
