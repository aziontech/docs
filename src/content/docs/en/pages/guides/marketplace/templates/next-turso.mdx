The **Next.js App + Configurations + Turso** template provides a quick start to build a Next.js application with custom configurations, App Router, and integration with a Turso Database.

This template uses Next version `13.5.6` and LibSQL `0.5.3`.

---

## Requirements

To use this template, you must:

- Create a [Turso account](https://accounts.turso.tech/sign-up).
- Have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) to connect with Azion and create your new repository.
  - Every push will be deployed automatically to this repository to keep your project updated.
- Enable [Edge Functions](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-functions/) and [Application Accelerator](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/application-accelerator/) in your Azion account.

To enable them:

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Account menu**.
2. Select the **Billing & Subscriptions** option.
3. Select the **Subscriptions** tab.
4. Activate the switch for each module.

:::caution[warning]
If these modules are activated, the execution of this template could generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](/en/documentation/products/pricing/) for more information. Any cost generated by Turso usage will be processed and billed separately on the Turso platform. Visit the [Turso documentation](https://docs.turso.tech/introduction) for more details.

## Getting the template

To start using this template:

1. Access [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com/).
2. Click the **+ Create** button on the homepage.
3. In the modal, select the **Templates** option.
4. Browse and select the **Next.js App + Configurations + Turso** card.

---

## Setting up the template

In the configuration form, you must provide the information to configure your application. Fill in the presented fields. 

Fields identified with an asterisk are mandatory.

1. Connect Azion with your GitHub Account.
- A pop-up window will open to confirm the installation of the [Azion GitHub App](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/azion-github-app/), a tool that connects your GitHub account with Azion's platform.
- Define your permissions and repository access as desired.
2. Select the **Git Scope** to work with.
3. In **Application Name** *, define a name for your edge application.
- Use a unique and easy-to-remember name. If the name has already been used, the platform returns an error message.
- The bucket for storage and the edge function will use the same name.
4. Enter your **Turso Database Token** *, the authorization token to access your Turso account.
5. Click the **Save** button to start the deployment process.

:::note
If the modules' subscription is disabled, the deployment will fail. If you provide an invalid Turso token, the template will be executed, but you'll be unable to run the application; in this case, you should modify the environment variables created by the template.
:::

During the deployment, you'll be able to follow the process through a window showing off the logs. When it's complete, the *deployment* page appears, confirming the edge application has been successfully created.

This page shows information about the application and some options to continue your journey.

:::note
The link to the edge application allows you to see it on the browser. However, it takes a certain time to propagate and configure the application in Azion's edge locations. It may be necessary to wait a few minutes for the URL to be activated and for the application page to be effectively displayed in the browser.
:::

### Key configurations

This template deploys a basic Next.js application containing a domain to access the Single-Page Application (SPA), as well as [Edge Storage configuration](/en/documentation/products/store/edge-storage/), cache settings, Gzip compression, and Rules Engine rules to improve the performance and delivery of static files.

It creates a new GitHub repository, including a GitHub Action to enable a continuous development workflow and keep your application up to date. It also creates a new Turso database you can manage, with integration under the `/turso` route.

Additionally, **Next.js App + Configurations** creates files to implement the [App Router format](https://nextjs.org/docs/app), including the index page, edge API routing, and Custom Route Handlers, in the new repository during the deployment.

This template also provides a basic CRUD example of how to integrate a Next.js application with a Turso Database and delivers an API route `/api/posts`, which enables Turso's [LibSQL SDK](https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql) to connect to the database to create, read, update, and delete items.

---

## Managing your database

You can use the Azion domain to access the application through the browser and interact with the database through the static interface that was created.

By using this interface, you're able to create, retrieve, update, and delete items in your posts database, which is now linked to this new application. To do so, the interface provides an input area and icon buttons to manage your data as required.

All changes will be reflected on your application and your Turso database as well.

---

## Managing the template

Considering that this initial setup may not be optimal for your specific edge application, all settings can be customized any time you need through Azion Console.

To manage and edit your edge application's settings, proceed as follows:

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Edge Application**.
- You'll be redirected to the **Edge Application** page. It lists all the edge applications you've created. 
2. Select the edge application related to this template. 
- The list is organized alphabetically. You can also use the **search bar** located in the upper-left corner of the list; currently, it filters only by **Application Name**.

After selecting the edge application you'll work on, you'll be directed to a page containing all the settings you can configure.

:::tip
Read the documentation about [managing edge applications](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/first-steps/) for more details.

### Adding a custom domain

The edge application created during the deployment has an assigned Azion domain to make it accessible through the browser. The domain has the following format: `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/`. However, you can add a custom domain for users to access your edge application through it.
