The **Next.js App + Configurations + Turso** template provides a quick start to build a Next.js application with custom configurations, App Router, and integration with a Turso Database.

This template uses Next version `13.5.6` and LibSQL `0.5.3`.

---

## Requirements

To use this template, you must:

- Create a [Turso account](https://accounts.turso.tech/sign-up).
- Install the [Turso CLI](https://docs.turso.tech/cli/introduction).
- Create a [database](https://docs.turso.tech/quickstart) with a table called `posts`, with the fields `id` and `message`, as explained in the [next section](#creating-a-turso-database).
- Generate your GitHub personal token.

:::tip
While generating your GitHub personal token, grant your scope with the permissions to authorize an OAuth app or a personal token to access public and private repositories, including read and write access to code. You must also enable the **workflow** option to allow adding and updating GitHub Actions workflow files. 

Note that permissions can be scoped either to a user, an organization, or a repository. Read the [Creating a personal access token documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) for more information.
:::

You must also activate:
 <Tag severity="info"  severity="info" client:only="vue">
[Edge Functions](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-functions/)
</Tag>
<br/>
 <Tag severity="info"  severity="info" client:only="vue">
[Application Accelerator](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/application-accelerator/)
</Tag>

To enable them:

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Account menu**.
2. Select the **Billing & Subscriptions** option.
3. Select the **Subscriptions** tab.
4. Activate the switch for each module.

:::caution[warning]
If these modules are activated, the execution of this template could generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](/en/documentation/products/pricing/) for more information.

### Creating a Turso database

Assuming you've already created a Turso account and installed the Turso CLI on your computer, you'll just need to complete the following steps using a few commands:

- Authenticate your Turso account: `turso login`
- Create a new database: `turso db create`
- List your databases: `turso db list`
    - You'll obtain the LibSQL URL for your database.
- Create an authorization token to access it: `turso db tokens create [your database name]`
    - In this case, the name for your database should be `posts`.
    - Remember to save it in a secure place.
- Open the shell interface of your database: `turso db shell [your database name]`
- Create the table that'll be used by this template using SQL:

```bash
CREATE TABLE posts (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  message varchar(140)
);
.quit
```

If you've run all the commands correctly, you'll be able to use the URL/token during the launch process of this template.

## Getting the template

To start using this template, access [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com) and click the **+ Create** button on the homepage.

This will open a modal where you can select **Templates** > **Next.js App + Configurations + Turso** card.

---

## Setting up the template

On the template's page, click the **Settings** tab to open the configuration form and provide the information to configure your application. 

Fields identified with an asterisk are mandatory.

- **Application Name** *: the name of your edge application on Azion.
- **GitHub Personal Token** *: your GitHub personal token.
- **Turso Database URL** *: the LibSQL URL to connect with your Turso database.
- **Turso Authorization Token** *: the authorization token to access your Turso database.

After completing all the information, click the **Next** button, located in the bottom-right corner. This will start the deployment process.

:::note
If you provide an invalid GitHub personal token, the creation of the edge application will be executed, but the system won't be able to create the new repository in your GitHub Account. If the modules' subscription is disabled, the deployment will fail.
:::

---

## Deploying the template

You can follow the deployment process through a window showing off the logs. When it's complete, the *deployment* page appears, confirming the edge application has been successfully created.

This page shows information about the application and some options to continue your journey.

:::note
The link to the edge application allows you to see it on the browser. However, it takes a certain time to propagate and configure the application in Azion's edge locations. It may be necessary to wait a few minutes for the URL to be activated and for the application page to be effectively displayed in the browser.
:::

Now you can [manage and adjust the settings](#managing-the-template) through Azion Console.

### Key configurations

This template deploys a basic Next.js application containing a domain to access the Single-Page Application (SPA) and demonstrate the integration under the `/turso` route, as well as [Edge Storage configuration](/en/documentation/products/store/edge-storage/), cache settings, Gzip compression, and Rules Engine rules to improve the performance and delivery of static files.

It creates a new GitHub repository, including a GitHub Action to enable a continuous development workflow and keep your application up to date.

Additionally, **Next.js App + Configurations** creates files to implement the [App Router format](https://nextjs.org/docs/app), including the index page, edge API routing, and Custom Route Handlers, in the new repository during the deployment.

This template also provides a basic CRUD example of how to integrate a Next.js application with a Turso Database and delivers an API route `/api/posts`, which enables Turso's [LibSQL SDK](https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql) to connect to the database to create, read, update, and delete items.

---

## Managing the template

Considering that this initial setup may not be optimal for your specific edge application, all settings can be customized any time you need through Azion Console.

To manage and edit your edge application's settings, proceed as follows:

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Edge Application**.
- You'll be redirected to the **Edge Application** page. It lists all the edge applications you've created. 
2. Select the edge application related to this template. 
- The list is organized alphabetically. You can also use the **search bar** located in the upper-left corner of the list; currently, it filters only by **Application Name**.

After selecting the edge application you'll work on, you'll be directed to a page containing all the settings you can configure.

:::tip
Read the documentation about [managing edge applications](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/first-steps/) for more details.

### Continuous deployment

Once the template is deployed, you can also edit and update your args and code, as well as implement a continuous deployment workflow. However, you'll need first to declare secrets on your project's GitHub repository to complete the second build with the changes. When the second build is completed, you'll be able to manage your project with a continuous deployment workflow and edit the args as desired.

To do so, open your new **[NAME]** repository on GitHub. Then, go to **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Action** to [add your variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets), following these instructions:

1. Add the Azion personal token to the *secrets*:
- Read [how to generate an Azion personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) in the documentation.

```bash
    AZION_PERSONAL_TOKEN=<value>
```

2. Add the environments for use in the action workflow in the **main.yml** file, included in the **.github/workflows** folder of your repository:

```yml
  - name: edge-...
    id: azion_edge
    ...
    with:
        ....
        azionPersonalToken: ${{ secrets.AZION_PERSONAL_TOKEN }}
        ....

```

3. Open a pull request to merge the changes to the main branch and start the automatic deployment.

Now, your project is ready to work with a continuous deployment workflow, updating instantly any changes in the application or the repository. 

### Adding a custom domain

The edge application created during the deployment has an assigned Azion domain to make it accessible through the browser. The domain has the following format: `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/`. However, you can add a custom domain for users to access your edge application through it.

import LinkButton from '@aziontech/webkit/linkbutton';

<LinkButton severity="secondary" link="/en/documentation/products/guides/configure-a-domain/" label="go to configuring a domain guide" severity="secondary" />
