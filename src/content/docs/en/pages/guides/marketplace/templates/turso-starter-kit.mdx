The **Turso Starter Kit** accelerates the integration of a Turso database, created using Turso's [LibSQL SDK](https://turso.tech/libsql), into an edge function. It also provides an interface to easily create, update, and delete items in your database.

This template uses LibSQL `0.5.3`.

---

## Requirements

To use this template, you must:

- Create a [Turso account](https://accounts.turso.tech/sign-up).
- Install the [Turso CLI](https://docs.turso.tech/cli/introduction).
- Have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) to connect with Azion and create your new repository.
  - Every push will be deployed automatically to this repository to keep your project updated.
- Enable [Edge Functions](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-functions/) and [Application Accelerator](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/application-accelerator/) in your Azion account.
  - To enable them:

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Account menu**.
2. Select the **Billing & Subscriptions** option.
3. Select the **Subscriptions** tab.
4. Activate the switch for each module.

:::caution[warning]
If these modules are activated, the execution of this template could generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](/en/documentation/products/pricing/) for more information.

Any cost generated by Turso usage will be processed and billed separately on the Turso platform. Visit the [Turso documentation](https://docs.turso.tech/introduction) for more details.

## Deploying the template

You can obtain and configure your template through the Azion Console. To easily deploy it at the edge, click the button below.

<LinkButton
    label="Deploy"
    link="https://console.azion.com/create/turso/turso-starter-kit"
    icon="ai ai-azion"
    icon-pos="left"
  />

---

## Setting up the template

In the configuration form, you must provide the information to configure your application. Fill in the presented fields. 

Fields identified with an asterisk are mandatory.

1. Connect Azion with your GitHub Account.
- A pop-up window will open to confirm the installation of the [Azion GitHub App](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/azion-github-app/), a tool that connects your GitHub account with Azion's platform.
- Define your permissions and repository access as desired.
2. Select the **Git Scope** to work with.
3. In **Application Name** *, define a name for your edge application.
- Use a unique and easy-to-remember name. If the name has already been used, the platform returns an error message.
- The bucket for storage and the edge function will use the same name.
4. Enter the following information:
- **Turso Authorization Token** *: the authorization token to access your Turso account.
- **Turso Organization** *: the name of your organization in Turso. For individual accounts, enter your login user.
- **Turso Group**: the name of the group in the organization where the database will be created. Default value: *default*.
5. Click the **Deploy** button to start the deployment process.

:::note
If the modules' subscription is disabled, the deployment will fail. If you provide an invalid Turso token, the template will be executed, but you'll be unable to run the application; in this case, you should modify the environment variables created by the template.
:::

During the deployment, you'll be able to follow the process through a window showing the logs. When it's complete, the page shows information about the application and some options to continue your journey.

:::note
The link to the edge application allows you to see it on the browser. However, it takes a certain time to propagate and configure the application in Azion's edge locations. It may be necessary to wait a few minutes for the URL to be activated and for the application page to be effectively displayed in the browser.
:::

### Key configurations

This template deploys a basic edge application with a domain to access the interface and an edge function including a CRUD query example. Additionally, it creates an instance and a Default Rule to execute the function, as well as sets new environment variables for your Turso credentials.

It also creates a new GitHub repository, including a GitHub Action to enable a continuous development workflow and a new Turso database you can manage, with integration under the `/turso` route.

---

## Managing your database

You can use the Azion domain to access the application through the browser and interact with the database through the static interface that was created.

By using this interface, you're able to create, retrieve, update, and delete items in your posts database, which is now linked to this new application. To do so, the interface provides an input area and icon buttons to manage your data as required.

All changes will be reflected on your application and your Turso database as well.

---

## Managing the template

Considering that this initial setup may not be optimal for your specific edge application, all settings can be customized any time you need through Azion Console.

To manage and edit your edge application's settings, proceed as follows:

1. [Access Azion Console](https://console.azion.com).
2. On the upper-left corner, select **Products menu** > **Edge Application**.
- You'll be redirected to the **Edge Application** page. It lists all the edge applications you've created.
3. Find the edge application related to your template and select it.
- The list is organized alphabetically. You can also use the **search bar** located in the upper-left corner of the list; currently, it filters only by **Application Name**.

After selecting the edge application you'll work on, you'll be directed to a page containing all the settings you can configure.

:::tip
Read the documentation about [managing edge applications](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/first-steps/) for more details.
:::

### Adding a custom domain

The edge application created during the deployment has an assigned Azion domain to make it accessible through the browser. The domain has the following format: `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/`. However, you can add a custom domain for users to access your edge application through it.
