The Azion **Hello World** template deploys an application that prints a *Hello, World!* message in your browser and you can use it as a starting point to become familiar with **Azion Web Platform** and edge computing capabilities.

---

## Requirements

- A [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) to connect with Azion and create your new repository.
  - Every push will be deployed automatically to this repository to keep your project updated.
- This template uses [Functions](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/functions/), and it may generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/) for more information.

## Deploying the template

You can obtain and configure your template through the Azion Console. To easily deploy it at the edge, click the button below.

<LinkButton
    label="Deploy"
    link="https://console.azion.com/create/azion/edge-hello-world"
    icon="ai ai-azion"
    icon-pos="left"
  />

## Setting up the template

In the configuration form, you must provide the information to configure your application. Fill in the presented fields. 

Fields identified with an asterisk are mandatory.

1. Connect Azion with your GitHub account.
- A pop-up window will open to confirm the installation of the [Azion GitHub App](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/azion-github-app/), a tool that connects your GitHub account with Azion's platform.
- Define your permissions and repository access as desired.
2. Select the **Git Scope** to work with.
3. Define a name for your application.
- The bucket for storage and the function will use the same name.
- Use a unique and easy-to-remember name. If the name has already been used, the platform returns an error message.
4. Click the **Deploy** button to start the deployment process.

During the deployment, you'll be able to follow the process through a window showing the logs. When it's complete, the page shows information about the application and some options to continue your journey.

:::note
The link to the application allows you to see it on the browser. However, it takes a certain time to propagate and configure the application in Azion's edge locations. It may be necessary to wait a few minutes for the URL to be activated and for the application page to be effectively displayed in the browser.

### Key configurations

By deploying the **Hello World** template, the script creates an application to run on Azion's platform, including its Azion Workload domain and multiple configurations. It also creates an function for the custom logic to show the *Hello World!* message.

Additionally, a GitHub repository is created in your account to manage the source code. The script installs all required dependencies and registers the deployment details, including information related to the version deployed and the timestamp of changes. The repository includes a GitHub Action to ensure a continuous deployment workflow, keeping your project up to date. 

If you want to know more on how to edit and customize your project's settings, go to the [Managing the template](#managing-the-template) section.

## Managing the template

Considering that this initial setup may not be optimal for your specific application, all settings can be customized any time you need by using Azion Console.

To manage and edit your application's settings, proceed as follows:

1. [Access Azion Console](https://console.azion.com).
2. On the upper-left corner, select **Products menu** > **Applications**.
- You'll be redirected to the **Applications** page. It lists all the applications you've created.
3. Find the application related to the **Hello World** template and select it. 
- The list is organized alphabetically. You can also use the **search bar** located in the upper-left corner of the list; currently, it filters only by **Application Name**.

After selecting the application you'll work on, you'll be directed to a page containing all the settings you can configure.

:::tip
Read the documentation about [managing applications](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/first-steps/) for more details.

### Adding a custom domain

The application created during the deployment has an assigned Azion Workload domain to make it accessible through the browser. The domain has the following format: `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`. However, you can add a custom domain for users to access your application through it.

import LinkButton from 'azion-webkit/linkbutton';
