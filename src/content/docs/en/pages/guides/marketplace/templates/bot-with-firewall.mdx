The **Bot Manager Lite Integration Kit** template provides an easy way to integrate the Bot Manager Lite function in an existent edge firewall on Azion. This template automatically creates a new function instance for Bot Manager Lite and a Rules Engine rule to run it in the selected edge firewall.

:::tip
If you're not sure which steps apply to your account, see [this guide](/en/documentation/products/guides/verify-account-migration/) to determine if your account has already been migrated.
:::

:::note
Bot Manager Lite integration is a [lite version](/pt-br/documentacao/produtos/guias/bot-manager-lite/) available in the Marketplace.

Azion provides the Bot Manager add-on, a comprehensive solution for bot management. Contact the [Sales team](https://www.azion.com/pt-br/contate-vendas/) for more details on the Bot Manager subscription.

## Requirements

Before deploying this template, you must:

- Have an [edge firewall](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-firewall/) created in your account.
    - During the setup of the template, you must inform the ID of your existing edge firewall to add the Bot Manager Lite instance. If the ID doesn't exist, the execution will fail. Check [how to configure and edit an edge firewall](/en/documentation/products/secure/secure-application/#step-1-configure-main-settings).
- Launch the latest version of the **Bot Manager Lite** integration.
    - Go to [Azion Marketplace](https://console.azion.com/marketplace) to install this integration by clicking the **Install* button. Check the [How to install Azion Bot Manager Lite](/en/documentation/products/guides/bot-manager-lite/) guide for more details.
    - If you didn't install the Bot Manager Lite function before deploying this template, the execution will fail and a log explaining the reason will be printed.

- This template uses [Edge Functions](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-functions/) and it may generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/) for more information.

To deploy via API v4:

<Code lang="bash" code={`curl --request POST \\\
  --url https://api.azion.com/v4/marketplace/templates/deploy \\\
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \\\
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\

<Fragment slot="panel.apiv3">

To integrate Bot Manager Lite via API v3:

1. First, create a Bot Manager Lite function instance:

<Code lang="bash" code={`curl --request POST \\\
  --url https://api.azionapi.net/edge_firewall/<edge_firewall_id>/functions_instances \\\
  --header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \\\
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\
  --header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \\\
  --data '{
    "name": "Bot Manager Lite Instance",
    "edge_function_id": <bot_manager_function_id>,
    "args": {
      "threshold": 10,
      "action": "allow",
      "internal_logs": 2
    }
  }'`} />

2. Create a Rules Engine rule to execute the function:

<Code lang="bash" code={`curl --request POST \\\
  --url https://api.azionapi.net/edge_firewall/<edge_firewall_id>/rules_engine \\\
  --header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \\\
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\
  --header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \\\
  --data '{
    "name": "Bot Manager Lite Rule",
    "behaviors": [
      {
        "name": "run_function",
        "argument": "<function_instance_id>"
      }
    ],
    "criteria": [
      []
    ]
  }'`} />

## Setting up the template

In the configuration form, you must provide the information to configure your application. Fill in the presented fields. 

- **Edge Firewall ID** *: the ID of your existing edge firewall to add the Bot Manager Lite instance.
    - To get the ID, you can go to the [Edge Firewall page](https://console.azion.com/edge-firewall), select the one you want to use, and copy the ID in the URL. You can also get it via [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/#e21929ff-f172-44d0-a3dc-58ecc11b652e).
    - This field is mandatory.

After completing all the information, click the **Deploy** button, located in the bottom-right corner. This will start the deployment process.

:::note
If it doesn't comply with any of the requirements, the execution will fail and a log explaining the reason will be printed.
:::

You can follow the deployment process through a window showing the logs. When it's complete, the page shows information about the application and some options to continue your journey.

:::note
The link to the edge application allows you to see it on the browser. However, it takes a certain time to propagate and configure the application in Azion's edge locations. It may be necessary to wait a few minutes for the URL to be activated and for the application page to be effectively displayed in the browser.
:::

Now you can [manage and adjust the settings](#managing-the-template) through Azion Console.

### Key configurations

The template verifies if the account complies with the requirements (if the latest version of Bot Manager Lite is installed, the informed edge firewall exists, and the Edge Functions module is enabled) to create a function instance of the Bot Manager Lite and create a Rules Engine rule to execute the function instance.

If it doesn't comply with any of the requirements, the execution will fail and a log explaining the reason will be printed.

The function instance has the following JSON Args:

```json
{
  "threshold": 10,
  "action": "allow",
  "internal_logs": 2
}
```

Where:

- `threshold`: the maximum score the request can reach before the function takes an action. If it has no value, the function won't take action. *Default value: 10*.
- `action`: the action to be taken by the function whenever the request's score is greater or equals the defined threshold. Possible values: allow, custom_html, deny, drop, hold_connection, random_delay, and redirect. *Default value: allow*.
- `internal_logs`: every execution of the Bot Manager Lite writes report logs, no matter the score of the request. 

You can calibrate and edit the arguments to better adjust the integration to your needs. Read more on [How to manage bots](/en/documentation/products/guides/secure/manage-bots/).

---

## Viewing logs

After executing the template, the requests will generate logs that can be seen in [Real-Time Events](/en/documentation/products/observe/real-time-events/). By analyzing the logs generated by Bot Manager Lite, you can get insights to understand if any changes in the function instance's JSON Args are needed.

Read more on [How to observe and calibrate rules](/en/documentation/products/guides/secure/manage-bots/).

You can also use [Data Stream](/en/documentation/products/observe/data-stream/) to monitor the activity. 

---

## Managing the template

All settings can be customized at any time you need through Azion Console. To manage and edit your edge application's settings, proceed as follows:

1. [Access Azion Console](https://console.azion.com) > **Edge Application**.
- You'll be redirected to the **Edge Application** page. It lists all the edge applications you've created. 
2. Select the edge application related to this template. 
- The list is organized alphabetically. You can also use the **search bar** located in the upper-left corner of the list; currently, it filters only by **Application Name**.

After selecting the edge application you'll work on, you'll be directed to a page containing all the settings you can configure.

:::tip
Read the documentation about [managing edge applications](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/first-steps/) and [how to configure cache policies for Edge Application](/en/documentation/products/guides/cache-settings/) for more details.
:::

### Adding a custom domain

The edge application created during the deployment has an assigned Azion domain to make it accessible through the browser. The domain has the following format: `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/`. However, you can add a custom domain for users to access your edge application through it.
