**WordPress InstaCreator** is a template designed by Azion to enable the automated creation of a WordPress project from scratch.

This template sets up an edge application and its domain, along with a pre-configured set of common cache rules, cache rules for static files and images, and bypass routes. These configurations optimize your website's performance.

By employing **WordPress** and **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** infrastructure, you can implement a new project in the Azion Edge Platform and manage and run it on the edge.

---

## Requirements

The **WordPress InstaCreator** template employs Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure to work. To successfully create a project from scratch, you must have an AWS account to generate or retrieve your **AWS Access Key ID** and **AWS Secret Access Key**.

These credentials should be temporary and used solely for the purpose of running this template. You must also have the necessary permissions to create an **EC2 instance** and execute a **CloudFormation script** on the AWS platform.

For more details on AWS access keys, visit [AWS Account and Access Keys documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-appendix-sign-up.html).

## Getting the template

To create a WordPress website from scratch using this template, proceed as follows:

1. Access [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).
- If you don't have an account yet, create a new one [by visiting the sign-up page](https://manager.azion.com/signup/).

Fields identified with an asterisk are mandatory.

- **Application Name** *: the name of your edge application. It's used to identify and manage your application within Azion's platform.
  - Use a unique and easy-to-remember name. If the name has already been used, the platform returns an error message.
- **MySQL username** *: the username for your WordPress database.
  - This field only accepts alphanumeric values, including uppercase and lowercase letters.
- **MySQL user password** *: the password associated with your WordPress database user.
  - This field only accepts alphanumeric values, including uppercase and lowercase letters.
- **MySQL Root password** *: the root password for your WordPress database.
  - This field only accepts alphanumeric values, including uppercase and lowercase letters.

## Deploying your project to the edge

During the deployment, you'll be able to follow the process through a window showing off the logs. When it's complete, the *deployment* page appears, confirming the edge application for your project has been successfully created.

This page shows you the following sections:

- **Access your Edge Application** section includes the link to visit and explore your edge application.
- **Build Summary** contains the application's name and function.
- The **Deployment details** tab can be opened to access the logs related to the deployment. 
- **What do you want to do next?** provides recommendations regarding advanced options to enhance your edge application: **Customize Domain**, **Manage Edge Application**, **View Edge Application Metrics**, **View Edge Application Logs**, and the **Back to Home** button.

:::note
The link to the edge application allows you to see how it looks on the browser. However, it takes a certain time to propagate and configure the application in Azion's edge locations. It may be necessary to wait a few minutes for the URL to be activated and for the application page to be effectively displayed in the browser.
:::

:::caution[Warning]
In this page, the **Build Summary** shows the **KeyPair** to access your EC2 instance created in your AWS account. Copy and save this information in case you need to access the EC2 instance later.
:::

### Key configurations

This template creates a new Azion edge application and its domain, as well as defines some key configurations, including common cache rules, image file cache rules, static file cache rules, and bypass routes to optimize your WordPress website's performance.

Deploying the WordPress InstaCreator template also involves automatically:

- Creating an EC2 instance in your AWS account.
- Executing a CloudFormation script.
- Setting up your project in WordPress.

To know more on how to edit and customize your project's settings, go to the [Managing your project on Azion](#managing-your-project-on-azion) section.

2. On the upper-left corner, select the three horizontal lines to open the **Products menu**.
3. In the **BUILD** section, select **Edge Application**.
4. You'll be redirected to the **Edge Application** page.
- It lists all the edge applications you've created. 
5. Find the edge application related to your template and select it. 
6. In the **Main Settings** tab, find the **Edge Application Modules** section and active the switch for the product you want to enable.

:::caution[Warning]
If these products are activated, the execution of this template could generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/) for more information.

## Managing your project on Azion

Considering that this initial setup may not be optimal for your specific edge application, all settings can be customized any time you need by using Azion Real-Time Manager (RTM).

To manage and edit your edge application's settings, follow these steps:

1. [Access RTM](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. On the upper-left corner, select the three horizontal lines to open the **Products menu**.
3. In the **BUILD** section, select **Edge Application**. You'll be redirected to the **Edge Application** page.
- It lists all the edge applications you've created. 
4. Find the edge application related to your WordPress website and select it. 
- The list is organized alphabetically. You can also use the **search bar** located in the upper-left corner of the list; currently, it filters only by **Application Name**.

After selecting the edge application you'll work on, you're directed to a page containing all the settings you can configure.

Once the template is deployed, you also have full control over customizing your website's design, content, and functionality using the WordPress admin panel.

:::tip
Read the documentation about [managing edge applications](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/first-steps/) for more details. For specific WordPress-related questions, check [WordPress official](https://wordpress.com/) channels.

### Adding a custom domain

The edge application created during the deployment has an assigned Azion domain to make it accessible through the browser. The domain has the following format: `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/`. However, you can add a custom domain for users to access your edge application through it.
