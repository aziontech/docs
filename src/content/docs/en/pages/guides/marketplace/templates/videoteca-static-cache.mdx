The **Static Cache + Videoteca Player** template enhances the delivery and performance of static and dynamic content based on file extensions. It implements the Azion **Videoteca Player** integration for easy hosting of your Videofront's Videoteca player via iframe embedding. 

The deployment of this template creates a GitHub repository containing your project, an application with several Cache Settings and a preconfigured route to launch the Videoteca Player function, as well as a domain to facilitate your access and management through Azion Web Platform.

## Requirements

- A [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) to connect with Azion and create your new repository.
    - Every push will be deployed automatically to this repository to keep your project updated.
- The [Videoteca Player integration](/en/documentation/products/guides/videofront-player/) installed and configured in your Azion account.
- This template uses [Application Accelerator](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/application-accelerator/), [Functions](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/functions/), [Image Processor](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/image-processor/), and [Cache](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-cache/), and it may generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/) for more information.

## Deploying the template

You can obtain and configure your template through the Azion Console. To easily deploy it at the edge, click the button below.

<Button

      href="https://console.azion.com/create/videofront/static-cache-videoteca-player"

      label="Deploy"

    />

## Setting up the template

In the configuration form, you must provide the information to configure your application. Fill in the presented fields. 

Fields identified with an asterisk are mandatory.

1. Define a name for your application.
    - The bucket for storage and the function will use the same name.
    - Use a unique and easy-to-remember name. If the name has already been used, the platform returns an error message.
2. Fill the additional fields with the information needed for configuring the **Videoteca Player integration**.
    - `Origin Address`: the domain name or IP address for your origin.
    - `Custom Host Header`: customized value for the `host` header. Leave it blank to use the same address from the previous field. Read more about the host header and how to customize it on the [Origins](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/origins/#host-header) documentation.
    - `Videoteca Player Path`: the path for the Videoteca player. Example: `/player`.
    - `Videoteca Username`: the username for the Videoteca account.
    - `Videoteca API Token`: the token for the Videoteca API.

:::note
You must retrieve your credentials from your **Videoteca Account**. You can get your token at `https://<YOUR-USER>.videotecaead.com.br/Apidoc` by replacing `<YOUR-USER>` with your `username`.
:::

3. Click the **Deploy** button to start the deployment process.

During the deployment, you'll be able to follow the process through a window showing the logs. When it's complete, the page shows information about the application and some options to continue your journey.

:::note
The link to the application allows you to see it on the browser. However, it takes a certain time to propagate and configure the application in Azion's edge locations. It may be necessary to wait a few minutes for the URL to be activated and for the application page to be effectively displayed in the browser.

## Managing the template

Considering that this initial setup may not be optimal for your specific application, all settings can be customized any time you need by using Azion's platform.

To manage and edit your application's settings, follow these steps:

1. [Access Azion Console](https://console.azion.com).
2. On the upper-left corner, select **Products menu**, the icon with three horizontal lines, > **Applications**.
    - You'll be redirected to the **Applications** page. It lists all the applications you've created.
3. Find the application related to your template and select it.
    - The list is organized alphabetically. You can also use the **search bar** located in the upper-left corner of the list; currently, it filters only by **Application Name**.

After selecting the application you'll work on, you'll be directed to a page containing all the settings you can configure.

:::tip
Read the documentation about [managing applications](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/first-steps/) for more details.

### Adding a custom domain

The application created during the deployment has an assigned Azion Workload domain to make it accessible through the browser. The domain has the following format: `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/`. However, you can add a custom domain for users to access your application through it.

import Button from 'azion-webkit/components/Button';

<Button href="/en/documentation/products/guides/configure-a-domain/" label="go to configuring a domain guide" type="primary" theme="light" />
