**Azion Starter Kit** is ideal for taking your first steps within Azion Web Platform. With this template, you can accelerate the creation of a basic edge stack to explore the platform and its features.

This template includes:

- The deployment of a new application, with common caching rules for images and dynamic and static files.
- Azion Image Processor features to manipulate and process images directly at the edge.
- The creation of a new Firewall with rules to execute an function instance for Bot Manager Lite and deny requests from the pre-built Azion IP Tor Exit Nodes network list.

---

## Requirements

To use this template, you must:

- Launch the latest version of the **Bot Manager Lite** integration.
    - Go to [Azion Marketplace](https://console.azion.com/marketplace) to install this integration by clicking the **Install** button. Check the [How to install Azion Bot Manager Lite](/en/documentation/products/guides/bot-manager-lite/) guide for more details.
    - If you didn't launch the Bot Manager Lite function before trying to use this template, the execution will fail and a log explaining the reason will be printed.

- This template uses [Application Accelerator](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/application-accelerator/), [Functions](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/functions/), [Image processor](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/image-processor/), and [Network Shield](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-firewall/network-layer-protection/), and it may generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/) for more information.

## Deploying the template

You can obtain and configure your template through the Azion Console. To easily deploy it at the edge, click the button below.

  <LinkButton
    label="Deploy"
    link="https://console.azion.com/create/azion/azion-starter-kit"
    icon="ai ai-azion"
    icon-pos="left"
  />

## Setting up the template

In the configuration form, you must provide the information to configure your application. Fill in the presented fields. 

Fields identified with an asterisk are mandatory.

- **Application Name** *: the name of your new application, domain, and Firewall on Azion.
- **Origin Address** *: the address of the hosted origin the application should fetch the content from.
    - Example: `www.yourwebsite.com`
- **Custom Host Header**: in some cases, it may be necessary to add host information in the header request to retrieve information from the origin. This variable is used for that purpose.
    - Example: `${host}`. Read more about the host header and how to customize it on the [Origins](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/origins/#host-header) documentation.

After completing all the information, click the **Deploy** button, located in the bottom-right corner. This will start the deployment process.

During the deployment, you'll be able to follow the process through a window showing the logs. When it's complete, the page shows information about the application and some options to continue your journey.

:::note
The link to the application allows you to see it on the browser. However, it takes a certain time to propagate and configure the application in Azion's edge locations. It may be necessary to wait a few minutes for the URL to be activated and for the application page to be effectively displayed in the browser.
:::

Now you can [manage and adjust the settings](#managing-the-template) through Azion Console.

### Key configrations

The application includes the following rules and settings:

- A default rule composed of:
    - **Criteria**: if `${uri}` starts with `/`.
    - **Behavior**: then [Set Origin](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/rules-engine/#set-origin) as `Default Origin`.
    - For image optimization and caching, the file extensions that can be enhanced with these configurations are `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.bmp`, `.ico`, `.gif`, `.png`. 
    - For static content, the template supports the common static file extensions. 
- The template:
    - Respects the origin's cache settings (or uses a default TTL for cache).
    - Provides rules that alter caching settings for static files based on the file extension of the requested content to improve the delivery.

Additionally, the Firewall enhances security through the [Azion IP Tor Exit Nodes](/en/documentation/products/guides/secure/block-tor-networks/) network list and Azion [Bot Manager Lite](/en/documentation/products/guides/bot-manager-lite/).

The function instance for Bot Manager Lite has the following JSON Args:

```json
{
  "threshold": 10,
  "action": "allow",
  "internal_logs": 2
}
```

Where:

- `threshold`: the maximum score the request can reach before the function takes an action. If it has no value, the function won't take action. Default value: `10`.
- `action`: the action to be taken by the function whenever the request's score is greater than or equal to the defined threshold. Possible values: `allow`, `custom_html`, `deny`, `drop`, `hold_connection`, `random_delay`, and `redirect`. Default value: `allow`.
- `internal_logs`: every execution of the Bot Manager Lite writes report logs, no matter the score of the request.

The logs can be checked in [Real-Time Events](/en/documentation/products/observe/real-time-events/). By analyzing the logs generated by Bot Manager Lite, you can get insights to understand if any changes in the function instance's JSON Args are needed. You can also use Azion [Data Stream](/en/documentation/products/observe/data-stream/) as an observability tool. Read more on [How to observe logs and calibrate rules](/en/documentation/products/guides/secure/manage-bots/#use-real-time-events-to-observe-and-calibrate-rules).

## Managing the template

Considering that this initial setup may not be optimal for your specific application, all settings can be customized any time you need through Azion Console.

To manage and edit your application's settings, proceed as follows:

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Applications**.
- You'll be redirected to the **Applications** page. It lists all the applications you've created. 
2. Select the application related to this template. 
- The list is organized alphabetically. You can also use the **search bar** located in the upper-left corner of the list; currently, it filters only by **Application Name**.

After selecting the application you'll work on, you'll be directed to a page containing all the settings you can configure.

:::tip
Read the documentation about [managing applications](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/first-steps/) for more details.

### Adding a custom domain

The application created during the deployment has an assigned Azion Workload domain to make it accessible through the browser. The domain has the following format: `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/`. However, you can add a custom domain for users to access your application through it.

import LinkButton from 'azion-webkit/linkbutton';

<LinkButton link="/en/documentation/products/guides/configure-a-domain/" label="go to configuring a domain guide" severity="secondary" />
