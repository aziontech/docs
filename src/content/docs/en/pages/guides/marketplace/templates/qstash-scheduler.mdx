The **QStash EdgeFunction Scheduler** template is designed to set up and manage a custom edge function, which receives a user-configured schedule and dispatches it through QStash, a message queue and task scheduler for serverless runtimes.

---

## Requirements

Before using this template, you need to:

- Create an [Upstash account](https://console.upstash.com/login).
- In the [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/qstash), get your **Current Signing Key**, **Next Signing Key**, and **QStash Token** within the **QStash** tab.
- Have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) to connect with Azion and create your new repository.
  - Every push will be deployed automatically to this repository to keep your project updated.
- Enable [Edge Functions](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-functions/) in your Azion account.
    - To do so: 

1. Access [Console](https://console.azion.com) > **Account menu**.
2. Select the **Billing & Subscriptions** option.
3. Select the **Subscriptions** tab.
4. Activate the switch for the module.

:::caution[warning]
If a module is activated, the execution of this template could generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](/en/documentation/products/pricing/) for more information.

Any cost generated by Qstash usage will be processed and billed separately on the Upstash platform. Visit the [QStash documentation](https://upstash.com/docs/qstash/overall/getstarted) for more details.

## Getting the template

To start using the **QStash EdgeFunction Scheduler** template:

1. Access [Console](https://console.azion.com).
2. Click the **+ Create** button on the homepage.
3. In the modal, select the **Templates** option. 
4. Browse and select the **QStash EdgeFunction Scheduler** card.

---

## Setting up the template

In the configuration form, you must provide the information to configure your Azion application. Fill in the presented fields.

1. Connect Azion with your GitHub account.
- A pop-up window will open to confirm the installation of the [Azion GitHub App](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/azion-github-app/), a tool that connects your GitHub account with Azion's platform.
- Define your permissions and repository access as desired.
2. Select the **Git Scope** to work with.
3. Define a name for your edge application.
- The bucket for storage and the edge function will use the same name.
- Use a unique and easy-to-remember name. If the name has already been used, the platform returns an error message.
4. Enter the following information:
- **QStash Current Signing Key** *: a string to sign all messages sent to the destination.
  - Go to your Upstash Console and copy the `QSTASH_CURRENT_SIGNING_KEY` from the **Qstash** tab.
- **QStash Next Signing Key** *: a string used to sign messages after you've rotated your signing keys.
  - Go to your Upstash Console and copy the `QSTASH_NEXT_SIGNING_KEY` from the **Qstash** tab.
5. Click the **Deploy** button to start the deployment process.

During the deployment, you'll be able to follow the process through a window showing off the logs. When it's complete, the page shows information about the application and some options to continue your journey.

:::note
The link to the edge application allows you to see it on the browser. However, it takes a certain time to propagate and configure the application in Azion's edge locations. It may be necessary to wait a few minutes for the URL to be activated and for the application page to be effectively displayed in the browser.
:::

### Key configurations

When deployed, this template creates an edge function built with the arguments provided by the user. It also creates a new GitHub repository that includes an automation to enable continuous deployment. Additionally, the template creates and instantiates an edge application and its domain to ease the interaction with the edge function.

---

## Scheduling tasks

After the deployment is finished and propagated, you're able to start scheduling tasks.

:::note
The tasks must be scheduled in any format that can be transmitted in the HTTP request, such as JSON, XML, or binary. The examples below are using JSON.
:::

To do so, you have two options: [via terminal](#via-terminal) or [via Upstash console](#via-upstash-console).

### Via terminal

1. Get your application domain.
2. In the [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/qstash), copy the `QSTASH_TOKEN` from the **QStash** tab.
3. In your development environment, open the terminal.
4. Make an HTTP POST request to the specified URL to schedule your messages.

Use the following exemples for your request, according to the interval required:

#### Once

```bash
curl --request POST "https://qstash.upstash.io/v1/publish/{add your domain here}" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer {add your QStash token here}" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d "{ \"hello\": \"world\"}"
```

#### Every minute

```bash
curl --request POST "https://qstash.upstash.io/v1/publish/{add your domain here}" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer {add your QStash token here}" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Upstash-Cron: * * * * *" \
     -d "{ \"hello\": \"world\"}"
```

#### Every 10 minutes

```bash
curl --request POST "https://qstash.upstash.io/v1/publish/{add your domain here}" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer {add your QStash token here}" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Upstash-Cron: */10 * * * *" \
     -d "{ \"hello\": \"world\"}"
```

#### Every hour

```bash
curl --request POST "https://qstash.upstash.io/v1/publish/{add your domain here}" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer {add your QStash token here}" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Upstash-Cron: 0 * * * *" \
     -d "{ \"hello\": \"world\"}"
```

Where:

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--request POST` | Specifies the method of request sent. In this case, a HTTP POST method to post or schedule a HTTP message. |
| `-H "Authorization"` | Provides authorization information through a token for authentication. You must add your QStash token here. |
| `-H "Content-Type"` | Specifies the content type of the request body. In this case, JSON format. |
| `-H "Upstash-Cron"` | Schedules a cron-like job in Upstash, allowing you to automate tasks at specific intervals. |
| `-d` | Provides the data for the request body, including the JSON payload. The backslashes (`\`) before the double quotes (`"`) are used to ensure that the quotes are treated as part of the data within the JSON payload. |

Done. Your task is scheduled and will be executed according to the defined scheduling.

Your scheduled tasks are visible in the [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/qstash), within the **QStash** tab, for your review and monitoring.

### Via Upstash console

1. Copy your Azion application domain.
2. Go to the [Upstash Console](https://console.upstash.com/qstash) and open the **QStash** tab.
3. Complete the form with the requested information.
  - In the type field, select **Scheduled** and choose the delay. 
  - Alternatively, select **Once** to send an immediate and unique message.
4. Click the **Schedule** button.

Done. Your task is scheduled and visible in the **Scheduled Jobs** section for your review and monitoring.

:::note
You can also publish them using a REST API request. For more information, read the [QStash documentation](https://upstash.com/docs/qstash/api/messages/create).

## Managing the template

Considering that this initial setup may not be optimal for your specific edge application, all settings can be customized at any time in [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com). Once the template is deployed, you also have full control over customizing your Upstash account and QStash configurations.

To manage and edit your edge application's settings, follow these steps:

1. [Access Console](https://console.azion.com).
2. On the upper-left corner, select **Products menu** > **Edge Application**.
- You'll be redirected to the **Edge Application** page. It lists all the edge applications you've created.
3. Find the edge application relate to the Qstash Scheduler template and select it. 
- The list is organized alphabetically. You can also use the **search bar** located in the upper-left corner of the list; currently, it filters only by **Application Name**.

After selecting the edge application you'll work on, you'll be directed to a page containing all the settings you can configure.

:::tip
Read the documentation about [managing edge applications](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/first-steps/) for more details. For specific Upstash or QStash-related questions, check the [Upstash documentation](https://docs.upstash.com/).
:::

### Adding a custom domain

The edge application created during the deployment has an assigned Azion domain to make it accessible through the browser. The domain has the following format: `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/`. However, you can add a custom domain for users to access your edge application through it.

import LinkButton from 'azion-webkit/linkbutton';
