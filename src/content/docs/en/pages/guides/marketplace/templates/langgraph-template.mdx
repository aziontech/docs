The **LangGraph AI Agent Boilerplate** contains the configurations for creating intelligent, real-time agents that can query and interact with data stored in Azion's EdgeSQL database, delivering optimized performance and reduced latency for your applications.

This template is built to leverage Azion's robust edge computing infrastructure, ensuring scalability, security, and seamless integration with EdgeSQL. 

The deployment will create two EdgeSQL databases: one for conversation history and another for reference documents. It also creates a backend application developed with LangGraph for document management and agent functionality, and a Vue-based frontend for user interaction.

This template uses the version `3.3.4` of Vue.

## Requirements

- A [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) to connect with Azion and create your new repository.
    - Every push will be deployed automatically to this repository to keep your project updated.
- An [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/) API Key.    
- This template uses [Application Accelerator](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/application-accelerator/), [Edge Functions](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-functions/), and [Edge SQL](/en/documentation/products/store/edge-sql/), and it could generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/) for more information.

## Deploying the template

You can obtain and configure your template through the Azion Console. To easily deploy it at the edge, click the button below.

<LinkButton
    label="Deploy"
    link="https://console.azion.com/create/langgraph-ai-agent-boilerplate"
    icon="ai ai-azion"
    icon-pos="left"
  />

---

## Setting up the template

In the configuration form, you must provide the information to configure your application. Fill in the presented fields. 

Fields identified with an asterisk are mandatory.

1. Connect Azion with your GitHub account.
    - A pop-up window will open to confirm the installation of the [Azion GitHub App](/en/documentation/products/guides/azion-github-app/), a tool that connects your GitHub account with Azion's platform.
    - Define your permissions and repository access as desired.
2. Select the **Git Scope** to work with.
3. Define a name for your agent.
    - By default, the names of the documents and the messages databases follow the patterns `<agent_name>-vectorstore` and `<agent_name>-messagestore` respectively.
    - Use a unique and easy-to-remember name. If the name has already been used, the platform returns an error message.
4. Insert your **OpenAI** API key. 
5. Click the **Deploy** button to start the deployment process.

During the deployment, you'll be able to follow the process through a window showing off the logs. When it's complete, the page shows information about the application and some options to continue your journey.

:::note
The link to the edge application allows you to see it on the browser. However, it takes a certain time to propagate and configure the application in Azion's edge locations. It may be necessary to wait a few minutes for the URL to be activated and for the application page to be effectively displayed in the browser.

## Managing the template

### Setting up the database

This template creates two databases, one for conversation history and another for reference documents. To start using your own documents, you must setup the **documents** database by following these steps:

1. Access the Github repository for the **backend application** created during the deployment. Its name will be similar to `<your-agent-name>-backend-agent`.
2. You must have a `.env` file with your environment variables in it. If you want to create a new one, it must follow the structure below:

```
AZION_TOKEN=
OPENAI_API_KEY=
OPENAI_MODEL=
EMBEDDING_MODEL=

LANGSMITH_API_KEY=
LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=
LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=false

MESSAGE_STORE_DB_NAME=
MESSAGE_STORE_TABLE_NAME=

VECTOR_STORE_DB_NAME=
VECTOR_STORE_TABLE_NAME=
```
Where:

| Environment Variable      | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AZION_TOKEN               | The token for authenticating with Azion's platform.                         |
| OPENAI_API_KEY            | Your API key for accessing OpenAI services.                                 |
| OPENAI_MODEL              | The OpenAI model to be used for processing.                                 |
| EMBEDDING_MODEL           | The model used for generating embeddings. It must be the same for the documents and the database column.|
| LANGSMITH_API_KEY         | API key for accessing Langsmith services.                                   |
| LANGCHAIN_PROJECT         | The Langchain project identifier.                                           |
| LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2      | Enables or disables Langchain tracing (set to true or false).               |
| MESSAGE_STORE_DB_NAME     | The database name for storing conversation history messages.                |
| MESSAGE_STORE_TABLE_NAME  | The table name within the message store database for storing messages.      |
| VECTOR_STORE_DB_NAME      | The database name for storing your documents as vector embeddings.                            |
| VECTOR_STORE_TABLE_NAME   | The table name within the vector store database for storing embeddings.     |

:::tip
You can use the [Azion EdgeSQL Shell](/en/documentation/products/store/sql/edge-sql-shell-commands/) to interact with your databases.
:::

3. Open the file `setup/setup.ts`. This file contains the function that sets up the databases, and you can edit it to match your requirements:
    - You can change the names of environment variables to match your `.env` file if needed, or even pass some of them directly in the code.
    - Edit the value of the constant `productDocs`. It uses by default the return of the function `getDocs`, which is configured in the boilerplate to process data from an example file. You can add your own documents file in the `setup` folder.
    - The template automatically creates the databases during the deployment, but you can uncomment part of the code so the function creates your database according to the environment variables. There are two options for doing this:

    Using a static factory method:

```ts
const vectorStore = await AzionVectorStore.createVectorStore(
     embeddingModel,
     {
       dbName: VECTOR_STORE_DB_NAME,
       tableName: VECTOR_STORE_TABLE_NAME
     },
     {
       columns,
       mode: "hybrid"
     }
   );
```

    Create instance and setup database separately:

 ```ts 
 const vectorStore = new AzionVectorStore(embeddingModel, {
     dbName: VECTOR_STORE_DB_NAME,
     tableName: VECTOR_STORE_TABLE_NAME
   });
   await vectorStore.setupDatabase({
     columns,
     mode: "hybrid"
   }); 
``` 

    Uncomment the option you want to create your documents database.

3. Run the following command in the root directory of the project to run the function that sets up the database:

```bash
yarn setup
```

The reference documents database is now set and ready for your application to access it. Read the template documentation to see more details about configuring the project.

:::note
The template also creates a database for storing the messages exchanged with the agent. By default, it will store messages for **14 days**.

### Managing the edge application

Considering that this initial setup may not be optimal for your specific edge application, all settings can be customized any time you need by using Azion's platform.

To manage and edit your edge application's settings, follow these steps:

1. [Access Azion Console](https://console.azion.com).
2. On the upper-left corner, select **Products menu**, the icon with three horizontal lines, > **Edge Application**.
    - You'll be redirected to the **Edge Application** page. It lists all the edge applications you've created.
3. Find the edge application related to your template and select it.
    - The list is organized alphabetically. You can also use the **search bar** located in the upper-left corner of the list; currently, it filters only by **Application Name**.

After selecting the edge application you'll work on, you'll be directed to a page containing all the settings you can configure.

:::tip
Read the documentation about [managing edge applications](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/first-steps/) for more details.
:::

### Adding a custom domain

The edge application created during the deployment has an assigned Azion domain to make it accessible through the browser. The domain has the following format: `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/`. However, you can add a custom domain for users to access your edge application through it.

import LinkButton from 'azion-webkit/linkbutton';
