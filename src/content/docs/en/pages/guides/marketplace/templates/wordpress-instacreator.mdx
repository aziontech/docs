**WordPress InstaCreator** is a template designed by Azion to enable the automated creation of a WordPress project from scratch.

This template sets up an edge application and its domain, along with a pre-configured set of common cache rules, cache rules for static files and images, and bypass routes. These configurations optimize your website's performance.

By employing **WordPress** and **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** infrastructure, you can implement a new WordPress project enhanced by the Azion Edge Platform.

---

## Requirements

The **WordPress InstaCreator** template employs Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure to work. To successfully create a project from scratch, you must have an AWS account to generate or retrieve your **AWS Access Key ID** and **AWS Secret Access Key**.

These credentials should be temporary and used solely for the purpose of running this template. You must also have the necessary permissions to create an **EC2 instance** and execute a **CloudFormation script** on the AWS platform.

For more details on AWS access keys, visit [AWS Account and Access Keys documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-appendix-sign-up.html).

:::caution[Warning]
The execution of this template could generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](/en/documentation/products/pricing/) for more information.

Any cost generated by AWS and Amazon EC2 usage will be processed and billed separately on the AWS platform. Visit the [AWS documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/) for more details.

## Deploying the template

You can obtain and configure your template through the Azion Console. To easily deploy it at the edge, click the button below.

 <LinkButton
    label="Deploy"
    link="https://console.azion.com/create/wordpress/wordpress-instacreator"
    icon="ai ai-azion"
    icon-pos="left"
  />

---

## Setting up the template

In the configuration form, you must provide the information to configure your Azion application. Fill in the presented fields. 

Fields identified with an asterisk are mandatory.

- **Application Name** *: the name of your edge application. It's used to identify and manage your application within Azion's platform.
  - Use a unique and easy-to-remember name. If the name has already been used, the platform returns an error message.
- **MySQL username** *: the username for your WordPress database.
  - This field only accepts alphanumeric values, including uppercase and lowercase letters.
- **MySQL user password** *: the password associated with your WordPress database user.
  - This field only accepts alphanumeric values, including uppercase and lowercase letters.
- **MySQL Root password** *: the root password for your WordPress database.
  - This field only accepts alphanumeric values, including uppercase and lowercase letters.
- **AWS Access Key ID** *: the unique identifier that associates your AWS account with your credentials.
  - You need to generate or retrieve this information on your AWS Account.
- **AWS Secret Access Key** *: the secret key associated with your AWS Access Key ID.
  - You need to generate or retrieve this information on your AWS Account.

After completing all the information, click the **Deploy** button, located in the bottom-right corner. This will start the deployment process.

During the deployment, you'll be able to follow the process through a window showing the logs. When it's complete, the page shows information about the application and some options to continue your journey.

:::note
The link to the edge application allows you to see it on the browser. However, it takes a certain time to propagate and configure the application in Azion's edge locations. It may be necessary to wait a few minutes for the URL to be activated and for the application page to be effectively displayed in the browser.
:::

:::caution[Warning]
This page will show the **KeyPair** to access your EC2 instance created in your AWS account. Copy and save this information in case you need to access the EC2 instance later.

### Key configurations

This template creates a new Azion edge application and its domain, as well as defines some key configurations, including common cache rules, image file cache rules, static file cache rules, and bypass routes to optimize your WordPress website's performance.

Deploying the WordPress InstaCreator template also involves automatically:

- Creating an EC2 instance in your AWS account.
- Executing a CloudFormation script.
- Setting up your project in WordPress.

To know more on how to edit and customize your project's settings, go to the [Managing your project on Azion](#managing-your-project-on-azion) section.

## Managing your project on Azion

Considering that this initial setup may not be optimal for your specific edge application, all settings can be customized any time you need by using Azion Console.

To manage and edit your edge application's settings, follow these steps:

1. [Access Console](https://console.azion.com).
2. On the upper-left corner, select **Products menu** > **Edge Application**.
- You'll be redirected to the **Edge Application** page. It lists all the edge applications you've created.
3. Find the edge application related to your WordPress website and select it.
- The list is organized alphabetically. You can also use the **search bar** located in the upper-left corner of the list; currently, it filters only by **Application Name**.

After selecting the edge application you'll work on, you're directed to a page containing all the settings you can configure.

Once the template is deployed, you also have full control over customizing your website's design, content, and functionality using the WordPress admin panel.

### Adding a custom domain

The edge application created during the deployment has an assigned Azion domain to make it accessible through the browser. The domain has the following format: `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/`. However, you can add a custom domain for users to access your edge application through it.
