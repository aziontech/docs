The **Gatsby Boilerplate** helps you build a Single-Page Application (SPA) based on the Gatsby framework and run it directly on the edge of the network. By executing the boilerplate, several steps are encapsulated and automated, from repository management to edge deployment.

This template deploys an application, a domain, and a related GitHub repository to facilitate your access and management. It also contains a GitHub Action to enable a continuous integration workflow and keep your application and repository up to date.

The Gatsby Boilerplate uses Gatsby version `5.13.3` and React version `18.2.0`.

## Requirements

To use this template, you must:

- Have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) to connect with Azion and create your new repository.
  - Every push will be deployed automatically to this repository to keep your project updated.
-- This template uses [Application Accelerator](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/application-accelerator/), and it may generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/) for more information.

## Deploying the template

You can obtain and configure your template through the Azion Console. To easily deploy it at the edge, click the button below.

 <Button

      href="https://console.azion.com/create/gatsby/gatsby-boilerplate"

      label="Deploy"

      type="primary"

      theme="light"

      icon="ai ai-azion"

      icon-pos="left"

    />

## Setting up the template

In the configuration form, you must provide the information to configure your new application. Fill in the presented fields. 

Fields identified with an asterisk are mandatory.

1. Connect Azion with your GitHub account.
- A pop-up window will open to confirm the installation of the [Azion GitHub App](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/azion-github-app/), a tool that connects your GitHub account with Azion's platform.
- Define your permissions and repository access as desired.
2. Select the **Git Scope** to work with.
3. Define a name for your application.
- The bucket for storage and the function will use the same name.
- Use a unique and easy-to-remember name. If the name has already been used, the platform returns an error message.
4. Click the **Deploy** button to start the deployment process.

During the deployment, you'll be able to follow the process through a window showing the logs. When it's complete, the page shows information about the application and some options to continue your journey.

:::note
The link to the application allows you to see it on the browser. However, it takes a certain time to propagate and configure the application in Azion's edge locations. It may be necessary to wait a few minutes for the URL to be activated and for the application page to be effectively displayed in the browser.

## Managing the template

Considering that this initial setup may not be optimal for your specific application, all settings can be customized any time you need through Azion Console.

To manage and edit your application's settings, proceed as follows:

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Applications**.
- You'll be redirected to the **Applications** page. It lists all the applications you've created. 
2. Select the application related to this template. 
- The list is organized alphabetically. You can also use the **search bar** located in the upper-left corner of the list; currently, it filters only by **Application Name**.

After selecting the application you'll work on, you'll be directed to a page containing all the settings you can configure.

:::tip
Read the documentation about [managing applications](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/first-steps/) for more details.

### Adding a custom domain

The application created during the deployment has an assigned Azion Workload domain to make it accessible through the browser. The domain has the following format: `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/`. However, you can add a custom domain for users to access your application through it.

import Button from 'azion-webkit/components/Button';

<Button href="/en/documentation/products/guides/configure-a-domain/" label="go to configuring a domain guide" type="primary" theme="light" />
