**Image Optimization** includes configurations for enhancing image loading and caching based on file extension. These configurations use advanced cache key rules that are applied through Rules Engine for Edge Application.

You must link your origin with the template to start using this set of cache rules for delivery. After the deployment, the script creates a new edge application that runs on **Azion's Edge Computing Platform**, with which you can manage and adjust the settings. 

The file extensions that can be enhanced with these configurations are `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.bmp`, `.ico`, `.gif`, `.png`.

## Requirements

To use this template, you must activate:

<Tag severity="info" client:only="vue">
[Edge Functions](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-functions/)
</Tag>
<br/>
<Tag severity="info" client:only="vue">
[Application Accelerator](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/application-accelerator/)
</Tag>

You need to activate these modules via Azion Console. To do so:

1. Access [Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Account menu**
2. Select the **Billing & Subscriptions** option.
3. Select the **Subscriptions** tab.
4. Activate the switch for each module.

:::caution[warning]
If these modules are activated, the execution of this template could generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](/en/documentation/products/pricing/) for more information.

## Deploying the template

You can obtain and configure your template through the Azion Console. To easily deploy it at the edge, click the button below.

  <LinkButton
    label="Deploy"
    link="https://console.azion.com/create/azion/image-optimization"
    icon="ai ai-azion"
    icon-pos="left"
  />

## Setting up the template

In the configuration form, you must provide the information to configure your application. Fill in the presented fields. 

Fields identified with an asterisk are mandatory.

- **Application Name** *: the name of your edge application on Azion.
    - Use a unique and easy-to-remember name. If the name has already been used, the platform returns an error message.
- **Origin Address** *: the address of the hosted origin the edge application should fetch the original content from.
    - Example: `www.yourwebsite.com`
- **Custom Host Header**: in some cases, it may be necessary to add host information in the header request to retrieve information from the origin. This variable is used for that purpose.
    - Example: `${host}`. Read more about the host header and how to customize it on the [Origins documentation](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/origins/#host-header).
- **Image file extensions to cache** *: the file extensions for the rules, separated by a comma. You can add as many variables as you need, based on the example.
    - Example: `jpg,jpeg,bmp,ico,gif,png`
- **CDN Static Maximum TTL** *: a maximum TTL (time-to-live), in seconds, for cached content to be delivered.
    - Accepts values from `0` to `31536000`. Default value: `31536000`
- **Browser Image Maximum TTL** *: a maximum TTL (time-to-live), in seconds, for cached content in the browser.
    - Accepts values from `0` to `31536000`. Default value: `0`

After completing all the information, click the **Deploy** button, located in the bottom-right corner. This will start the deployment process.

During the deployment, you'll be able to follow the process through a window showing off the logs. When it's complete, the page shows information about the application and some options to continue your journey.

:::note
The link to the edge application allows you to see it on the browser. However, it takes a certain time to propagate and configure the application in Azion's edge locations. It may be necessary to wait a few minutes for the URL to be activated and for the application page to be effectively displayed in the browser.

Now, you can you can manage and adjust the settings through this new Azion edge application.

## Managing the template

Considering that this initial setup may not be optimal for your specific edge application, all settings can be customized any time you need by using Azion Console.

To manage and edit your edge application's settings, proceed as follows:

1. [Access Azion Console](https://console.azion.com).
2. On the upper-left corner, select **Products menu** > **Edge Application**.
- You'll be redirected to the **Edge Application** page. It lists all the edge applications you've created.
3. Find the edge application related to the **Image Optimization** template and select it. 
- The list is organized alphabetically. You can also use the **search bar** located in the upper-left corner of the list; currently, it filters only by **Application Name**.

After selecting the edge application you'll work on, you'll be directed to a page containing all the settings you can configure.

:::tip
Read the documentation about [managing edge applications](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/first-steps/) and [Azion Image Processor](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/image-processor/) for more details.
