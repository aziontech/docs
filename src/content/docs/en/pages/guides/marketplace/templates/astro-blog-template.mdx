This template contains the configurations to *create a new blog page based on the Astro framework*. After the deployment, you can interact with the default posts and interface that already exist in this template and customize them.

The **Astro Blog Starter Kit** template deploys an edge application, a domain, and a related GitHub repository to facilitate your access and management of the content and configurations. It also contains a GitHub Action to enable a continuous integration workflow and keep your application and repository up to date.

This template uses Astro version `4.2.6`.

## Requirements

To use this template, you must:

- Generate a GitHub Personal Token.

:::tip
While generating your GitHub personal token, grant your scope with the permissions to authorize an OAuth app or a personal token to access public and private repositories, including read and write access to code. You must also enable the **workflow** option to allow adding and updating GitHub Actions workflow files. 

Note that permissions can be scoped either to a user, an organization, or a repository. Read the [Creating a personal access token documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) for more information.
:::

You must also activate:
<Badge>
[Edge Functions](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-functions/)
</Badge>
<br/>
<Badge>
[Image Processor](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/image-processor/)
</Badge>

To enable these modules:

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Account menu**
2. Select the **Billing & Subscriptions** option.
3. Select the **Subscriptions** tab.
4. Activate the switch for each module.

:::caution[warning]
If these modules are activated, the execution of this template could generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/) for more information.

## Getting the template

To create a new Astro blog with this template, access [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com/) and click the **+ Create** button on the homepage.

This will open a modal where you can select **Templates** > **Astro Blog Starter Kit** card.

---

## Setting up the template

On the templateâ€™s page, click the **Settings** tab to open the configuration form and provide the information to configure your application. 

Fields identified with an asterisk are mandatory.

- **Application Name** *: the name of your edge application on Azion.
    - Use a unique and easy-to-remember name. If the name has already been used, the platform returns an error message.
- **GitHub Personal Token** *: your GitHub personal token.

After completing all the information, click the **Next** button, located in the bottom-right corner. This will start the deployment process.

---

## Deploying the template

You can follow the deployment process through a window showing off the logs. When it's complete, the *deployment* page appears, confirming the edge application has been successfully created.

This page shows information about the application and some options to continue your journey.

:::note
The link to the edge application allows you to see it on the browser. However, it takes a certain time to propagate and configure the application in Azion's edge locations. It may be necessary to wait a few minutes for the URL to be activated and for the application page to be effectively displayed in the browser.
:::

Now you can [manage and adjust the settings](#managing-the-template) through Azion Console.

---

## Managing the template

Considering that this initial setup may not be optimal for your specific edge application, all settings can be customized any time you need through Azion Console.

To manage and edit your edge application's settings, proceed as follows:

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Edge Application**.
- You'll be redirected to the **Edge Application** page. It lists all the edge applications you've created. 
2. Select the edge application related to this template. 
- The list is organized alphabetically. You can also use the **search bar** located in the upper-left corner of the list; currently, it filters only by **Application Name**.

After selecting the edge application you'll work on, you'll be directed to a page containing all the settings you can configure.

:::tip
Read the documentation about [managing edge applications](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/first-steps/) for more details.

### Continuous deployment

Once the template is deployed, you can also edit and update your configurations, as well as implement a continuous deployment workflow. However, you'll need to first declare secrets on your project's GitHub repository to complete the second build with the changes. When the second build is completed, you'll be able to manage your project with a continuous deployment workflow and edit as desired.

To do so, open your new **Astro Blog Starter Kit** repository on GitHub. Then, go to **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Action** to [add your variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets), following these instructions:

1. Add the Azion personal token to the *secrets*:
- Read [how to generate an Azion Personal Token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) in the documentation.

```bash
    AZION_PERSONAL_TOKEN=<value>
```

2. Add the environments for use in the action workflow in the **main.yml** file, included in the **.github/workflows** folder of your repository:

```yml
  - name: edge-...
    id: azion_edge
    ...
    with:
        ....
        azionPersonalToken: ${{ secrets.AZION_PERSONAL_TOKEN }}
        ....

```

3. Open a pull request to merge the changes to the main branch and start the automatic deployment.

Now, your project is ready to work with a continuous deployment workflow, updating instantly any changes in the application or the repository. 

### Adding a custom domain

The edge application created during the deployment has an assigned Azion domain to make it accessible through the browser. The domain has the following format: `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/`. However, you can add a custom domain for users to access your edge application through it.
