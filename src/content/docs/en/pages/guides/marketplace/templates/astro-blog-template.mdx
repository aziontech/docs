:::caution[important]
Azion has two user interfaces: Real-Time Manager and Console, which is in Preview stage. Currently, Console is only available for Developer plans and new accounts. Follow the steps according to the user interface you're using.
:::

This template contains the configurations to *create a new blog page based on the Astro framework*. After the deployment, you can interact with the default posts and interface that already exist in this template and customize them.

The **Astro Blog Starter Kit** template deploys an edge application, a domain, and a related GitHub repository to facilitate your access and management of the content and configurations. It also contains a GitHub Action to enable a continuous integration workflow and keep your application and repository up to date.

This template uses Astro version `4.2.6`.

## Setting up the template

In the configuration form, you must provide the information to configure your application. Fill in the presented fields. 

Fields identified with an asterisk are mandatory.

<Tabs client:visible>
    <Fragment slot="tab.console">Console </Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.rtm">Real-Time Manager </Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.console">
1. Connect Azion with your GitHub Account.
- A pop-up window will open to confirm the installation of the [Azion GitHub App](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/azion-github-app/), a tool that connects your GitHub account with Azion's platform.
- Define your permissions and repository access as desired.
2. Select the **Git Scope** to work with.
3. Define a name for your edge application.
- Use a unique and easy-to-remember name. If the name has already been used, the platform returns an error message.
4. Click the **Next** button to start the deployment process.
</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.rtm">
1. Select the **Settings** tab.
2. Select the **Git Scope**.
3. Define your **Application Name**, used to identify and manage your application within Azion's platform.
- Use a unique and easy-to-remember name. If the name has already been used, the platform returns an error message.
4. Click the **Next** button to start the deployment process.
</Fragment>

</Tabs>

During the deployment, you'll be able to follow the process through a window showing off the logs. When it's complete, the *deployment* page appears, confirming the edge application has been successfully created.

This page shows information about the application and some options to continue your journey.

:::note
The link to the edge application allows you to see it on the browser. However, it takes a certain time to propagate and configure the application in Azion's edge locations. It may be necessary to wait a few minutes for the URL to be activated and for the application page to be effectively displayed in the browser.
:::

The template includes a GitHub Action to enable continuous deployment. It's activated automatically if using Azion Console. In case of using Real-Time Manager (RTM), you must activate it manually, [declaring secrets on your project's GitHub repository](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions) to complete the second build with the changes.

## Managing the template

Considering that this initial setup may not be optimal for your specific edge application, all settings can be customized any time you need by using Azion's platform.

To manage and edit your edge application's settings, follow these steps:

<Tabs client:visible>
    <Fragment slot="tab.console">Console </Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.rtm">Real-Time Manager </Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.console">
1. [Access Azion Console](https://console.azion.com/).
2. On the upper-left corner, select **Products menu** > **Edge Application**.
- You'll be redirected to the **Edge Application** page. It lists all the edge applications you've created.
3. Find the edge application related to your template and select it.
- The list is organized alphabetically. You can also use the **search bar** located in the upper-left corner of the list; currently, it filters only by **Application Name**.
</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.rtm">
1. [Access Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. On the upper-left corner, select **Products menu** > **Edge Application**.
- You'll be redirected to the **Edge Application** page. It lists all the edge applications you've created.
3. Find the edge application related to your template and select it.
- The list is organized alphabetically. You can also use the **search bar** located in the upper-left corner of the list; currently, it filters only by **Application Name**.
</Fragment>

</Tabs>

After selecting the edge application you'll work on, you'll be directed to a page containing all the settings you can configure.

:::tip
Read the documentation about [managing edge applications](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/first-steps/) for more details.
:::

### Adding a custom domain

The edge application created during the deployment has an assigned Azion domain to make it accessible through the browser. The domain has the following format: `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/`. However, you can add a custom domain for users to access your edge application through it.
