The **Bot Manager Lite Starter Kit** template deploys an entirely new edge stack to enable customers to see the Bot Manager Lite in action.

The deployment automatically creates an application, an function, an Firewall, and a domain to access and test the features of Bot Manager Lite. This template is ideal to understand how this integration works and how it can help you secure your applications and digital assets.

:::note
Bot Manager Lite integration is a [lite version](/en/documentation/products/guides/bot-manager-lite/) available in the Marketplace.

Azion provides the Bot Manager add-on, a comprehensive solution for bot management. Contact the [Sales team](https://www.azion.com/pt-br/contate-vendas/) for more details on the Bot Manager subscription.

## Requirements

Before deploying this template, you must:

- Launch the latest version of the **Bot Manager Lite** integration.
    - Go to [Azion Marketplace](https://console.azion.com/marketplace) to install this integration by clicking the **Install** button. Check the [How to install Azion Bot Manager Lite](/en/documentation/products/guides/bot-manager-lite/) guide for more details.
    - If you didn't launch the Bot Manager Lite function before trying to use this template, the execution will fail and a log explaining the reason will be printed.

- This template uses [Functions](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/functions/) and it may generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/) for more information.

## Deploying the template

You can obtain and configure your template through the Azion Console. To easily deploy it at the edge, click the button below.

 <LinkButton
    label="Deploy"
    link="https://console.azion.com/create/azion/bot-manager-starter-kit"
    icon="ai ai-azion"
    icon-pos="left"
  />

---

## Setting up the template

In the configuration form, you must provide the information to configure your application. Fill in the presented fields. 

Fields identified with an asterisk are mandatory.

- **Applications Name** *: the name of your new application on Azion. It'll also be used to name your Firewall instance.
- **Sample Function Name** *: the name of the sample function that will be created.
    - Use a unique and easy-to-remember name for these fields.

After completing all the information, click the **Deploy** button, located in the bottom-right corner. This will start the deployment process.

:::note
If you didn't launch the Bot Manager Lite function before deploying this template, the execution will fail and a log explaining the reason will be printed.
:::

During the deployment, you'll be able to follow the process through a window showing the logs. When it's complete, the page shows information about the application and some options to continue your journey.

:::note
The link to the application allows you to see it on the browser. However, it takes a certain time to propagate and configure the application in Azion's edge locations. It may be necessary to wait a few minutes for the URL to be activated and for the application page to be effectively displayed in the browser.
:::

### Key configurations

This template deploys an entirely new edge configuration including:

- **A new application**, with the Functions module enabled, to instantiate your newly created function. The application will receive the requests that trigger the function.
- **A new domain**, to access your application and test Bot Manager Lite.
- **A new Firewall**, including the instance of the latest version of the Bot Manager Lite integration and a Rules Engine rule to trigger the execution of it.
- **A new function**, providing a basic UI application that can be used to test Bot Manager Lite.

## Testing the template

After running the template, you can access the Azion Workload domain, with the format `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/`. It'll show a testing page, where you can send "good" and "bad" requests to the Bot Manager Lite handle.

The testing page will render the response to the request:

- When a *good* request is sent, it'll render a success message.
- When a *bad* request is sent, it'll render the default response `HTTP 403 response status code`, because the Bot Manager Lite's action is set to execute the *deny* action.
    - You can redirect the *bad* request to a customized domain by modifying the JSON Args for the function.

---

## Viewing logs

The Bot Manager Lite function instance is set to always write logs. This way, whenever you hit any of the "Send Request" buttons, it'll generate logs that can be monitored in [Real-Time Events](/en/documentation/products/guides/secure/manage-bots/#use-real-time-events-to-observe-and-calibrate-rules) and [Data Stream](/en/documentation/products/observe/data-stream/).

## Managing the template

Being a testing template, the initial configuration is mostly demonstrative. However, you can use it as a base for creating an actual functional application. You can [configure a new origin](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/origins/) for the application and use it as *Default Origin*. You can also modify the JSON Args of your **Bot Manager Lite** instance for a more customized configuration.

To manage and edit your application's settings, proceed as follows:

1. [Access Azion Console](https://console.azion.com) > **Applications**.
- You'll be redirected to the **Applications** page. It lists all the applications you've created. 
2. Select the application related to this template. 
- The list is organized alphabetically. You can also use the **search bar** located in the upper-left corner of the list; currently, it filters only by **Application Name**.

After selecting the application you'll work on, you'll be directed to a page containing all the settings you can configure.

:::tip
Read the documentation about [managing applications](/en/documentation/products/build/applications/first-steps/) for more details.

### Adding a custom domain

The application created during the deployment has an assigned Azion Workload domain to make it accessible through the browser. The domain has the following format: `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/`. However, you can add a custom domain for users to access your application through it.

import LinkButton from 'azion-webkit/linkbutton';

<LinkButton link="/en/documentation/products/guides/configure-a-domain/" label="go to configuring a domain guide" severity="secondary" />
