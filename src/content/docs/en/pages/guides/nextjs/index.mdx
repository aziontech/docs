## Next.js and Server-side Rendering (SSR)

**Next.js**, a flexible framework based on the **React** library, provides powerful tools for building fast applications.

**SSR** generates HTML for each request, offering several benefits, including:

- Improved initial loading performance.
- Search engine optimization (SEO).
- Social media sharing.
- Enhanced user experience.
- Accessibility and compatibility.
- Code sharing and performance optimizations.

## Next.js SSR Project on the Azion Platform

### Requirements

Before getting started, make sure you have:

- An Azion platform account with Edge Functions enabled.
- Node.js runtime environment v18.x installed in your build environment.
- The latest version of Azion CLI installed.
- Next.js installed.

To install Azion CLI, visit the [Installing Azion CLI manually](/en/documentation/products/guides/cli-installing-manually/) page.

### Setting up the Project

1. Create a new folder for your project:

```bash
  mkdir next-js-azion
```

2. Access the project folder:

```bash
  cd next-js-azion
```

3. Inside the project folder, use the following command to create a Next.js project:

```bash
  npx create-next-app azion-next-ssr && cd azion-next-ssr && npm i next
```

4. Open the project directory in your preferred code editor, such as VSCode:

```bash
  code .
```

### Configuring Next.js for Azion

1. Open the `src/pages/api/hello.js` file in your project's root directory.
2. Paste the following content to the file:

```js
  // Next.js API route support: https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction
  
  export const runtime = 'edge' // 'nodejs' (default) | 'edge'
  
  export default function handler(req, res) {
    res.status(200).json({ name: 'John Doe' })
  }
```

### Building and Publishing the application on the Azion Platform

1. In the terminal, in your project's root directory, initialize the Azion Edge Application:

```bash
  azioncli edge_applications init --type nextjs
```

2. Run the `build` command:

```bash
  azioncli edge_applications build
```

3. Publish the application:

```bash
  azioncli edge_applications publish
```

After running the `publish` command, you'll receive a domain for accessing your SSR Next.js project on the Azion Platform.

Wait a few minutes so the *propagation* takes place, and then access your application using the provided domain, which should be similar to:

`https://ala5yasjasdsa0pnm.map.azionedge.net`
