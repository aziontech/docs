To point your traffic to Azion, you must associate your **Azion domain** to your **custom domain**. To do that, you must configure your DNS provider and associate the address of your custom domain to the `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net` address. 

:::note
This process will require you to associate a CNAME record to your domain. See [Migrate your DNS to Azion](link_migrate) for more information on how to associate an ANAME type record.
:::

Before you point your domain to Azion, you must have:

- A domain registered with a hosting service.
- An Azion [account and credentials](link_account).
- An [edge application](link_create).
- A [custom domain](link_configure#custom-domain).

## Verify custom domain

Before you point your domain to Azion, you need to associate your custom domain to your Azion domain to verify ownership. You can choose to verify your domain using [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](#via-rtm) or the [Azion API](#via-api).

### Via RTM

To point your Azion domain to a custom domain, you need to list the CNAMEs you want to configure for the application:

1. [Access RTM](https://manager.azion.com).
2. On the upper-left corner of the page, open the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, and then select **Domain**.
3. Click the domain you want to associate your custom domain to. If you don't have a domain, [create one first](link_configure_domain).
4. In the **CNAME** field, add the custom domains for the application. For example: `yourdomain.com`.
5. Disable the **CNAME access only** switch.
5. Click the **Save** button.

Now your Azion domain is ready to be associated to a custom domain on your DNS provider.

### Via API

Before you run the API, you'll need a personal token. See the [Azion API documentation](link_api_personal_token) for more information.

To edit a domain with the CNAMEs you want to associate to the edge application:

1. Run the following `GET` request to retrieve your domain's id:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/domains?order_by=name&sort=asc&page=1&page_size=10' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
```

2. You'll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
    ...
    "results": [
        {
            "id": <domain_id>,
            "name": "My Domain",
            "cnames": [],
            "cname_access_only": true,
            "digital_certificate_id": <digital_certificate_id>,
            "edge_application_id": <edge_application_id>,
            "is_active": true,
            "domain_name": "xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net"
        }
    ]
}
```

3. Locate the domain you wish to link to the custom domain and copy the `domain_id` value received in the response.
4. Run a `PATCH` request, adding the `domain_id` as a path, to update the `cnames` field with the domains you wish to configure:

```bash
curl --location --request PATCH 'https://api.azionapi.net/domains/<domain_id>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "cnames": [
        "*.yourdomain.com"
    ]
}'
```

  | Key | Description |
  | --- | --- |
  | `cnames` | Accepts a list of CNAMEs for the domains as values. For example, `["*.yourdomain.com", "*.yourdomain.org"]`. |

:::tip
If your application uses HTTPS, you might want to combine this process with the [association of a digital certificate](link_digital_certificate) to your custom domain.
:::

5. You should receive a response with the updated data.

## Modify domain records

Once you have a domain, you need to access your DNS provider and locate the **records management** area. There, you can modify every entry associated with your domain. The entry you need to associate your Azion domain to is a **CNAME** record.

:::note
Some services *don't allow you* to change your ANAME resolution directly, meaning you cannot directly point `yourdomain.org` to Azion this way. See how to [migrate your NS to Azion](link_migrate_ns).
:::

At your DNS provider, you can add or modify a `www` CNAME record and associate it to your edge application. See the documentation on how to edit domain records of some of the most popular DNS providers below:

- [AWS Route53](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/getting-started/hands-on/get-a-domain/)
- [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/help/manage-dns-records-680)
- [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/767/10/how-to-change-dns-for-a-domain/)

To configure your DNS records:

1. Sign in to your DNS provider.
2. Choose your domain.
3. Locate the page where you can modify DNS records for your domain.
4. Create or edit the `www` CNAME record of your domain by filling out the information:

| Name | Value | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `www` | `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net` | CNAME |

:::tip
Some providers allow you to add a wildcard (`*`) subdomain instead of a specific subdomain to cover all scenarios. This way, you won't need to specify that `www.yourdomain.com` and `blog.yourdomain.com` point to the same edge application address.
:::

5. Don't forget to save your settings.

Note that there might be a delay in propagation time when you access your application. If that's the case, [you can run the dig command](lin_dig_command_howto) in your terminal to check the DNS records of your edge node. For example:

```bash
dig +short yourdomain.org @200.0.0.0
```

Once the changes have propagated, you'll be able to access your edge application through your custom domain.
