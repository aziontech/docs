See how to retrieve data from an existing DB with Edge SQL and Edge Functions.

---

## Requirements 

- [Azion Edge Functions enabled](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-functions/).
- An active [Personal Token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/).

---

## Creating a database and adding a table

:::note 
Replace `{{token}}` with your personal token and `{{db_id}}` with the ID of the database.
:::

1. Create a database by executing the following cURL:

```
curl -X POST https://api.azion.com/v4/edge_sql/databases \
-H "Authorization: Token {{token}}" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "name": "mydatabase"
}'
```

:::note 
When the database is created, keep its ID. This piece of information is required in the next steps.
::: 

2. Add a table named users: 

```
curl -X POST 'https://api.azion.com/v4/edge_sql/databases/{{db_id}}/query' \
-H 'Authorization: Token {{token}}' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
    "statements": [
        "CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT NOT NULL);"
    ]
}'
```

:::note 
The creation of a database is an async task, so it might take a few minutes so the DB is able to receive and perform actions.
::: 

3. Populate the table with data: 

```
curl -X POST https://api.azion.com/v4/edge_sql/databases/{{db_id}}/query \
-H "Authorization: Token azion2b706cb52d46e72a3ef98f3e38067acc745" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
    "statements": [
        "INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, '\''user 1'\'');",
        "INSERT INTO users VALUES (2, '\''user 2'\'');",
        "INSERT INTO users VALUES (3, '\''user 3'\'');"
    ]
}'
```

Now, the DB is created and populated with rows.

## Creating an edge function to communicate with Edge SQL


1. On [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com/), on the upper-left corner, select **Edge Functions** in the **Edge Libraries** section.
2. Click on **Add a Function**.
3. Choose a name for your function.
4. Delete the placeholder function that is inside the code editor. 
5. Paste the following code: 

```js
import { Database } from "azion:sql";

async function db_query() {
  let connection = await Database.open("mydatabase");
  let rows = await connection.query("select * from users");
  let column_count = rows.columnCount();
  let column_names = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < column_count; i++) {
    column_names.push(rows.columnName(i));
  }
  let response_lines = [];
  response_lines.push(column_names.join("|"));
  let row = await rows.next();
  while (row) {
    let row_items = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < column_count; i++) {
      row_items.push(row.getString(i));
    }
    response_lines.push(row_items.join("|"));
    row = await rows.next();
  }
  const response_text = response_lines.join("\n");
  return response_text;
}

async function handle_request(request) {
  if (request.method != "GET") {
    return new Response("Method not allowed", { status: 405 });
  }
  try {
    return new Response(await db_query());
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(e.message, e.stack);
    return new Response(e.message, { status: 500 });
  }
}

addEventListener("fetch", (event) =>
  event.respondWith(handle_request(event.request))
);
``` 

:::note
Since in this example we're retrieving data, the method was set to be only GET. You can implement the business logic necessary to meet your needs.
:::

We've created an edge function that communicates with Edge SQL. Now, it's necessary to instantiate this function in a running edge application:
