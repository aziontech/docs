Azion provides different journeys to start building on the edge. One of them is using the **+ Create** button, located in the top navbar and the **Get Started** section on the homepage.

By clicking the **+ Create** button, you can select the option that better fits you to create new edge applications and resources, such as domains, variables, edge functions, edge services, digital certificates, and more.

## Starting the building process

To start building:

1. Access [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com/).
2. Click the **+ Create** button in the top navbar or the **Get Started** section.
3. Select the option you want to use:
- **Recommended**: explore some recommended options, including templates. 
- **Templates**: select a pre-designed project with default configurations and streamline the process of creating applications. You can find templates in commonly used frameworks. Get to know more about [Azion Templates](/en/documentation/products/marketplace/templates/).
- **Resources**: create or add applications and other resources such as domains, variables, edge functions, edge services, digital certificates, and more. Read more about [building with Azion](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/overview/).
- **Import from GitHub**: import your own GitHub repository to build and deploy a new edge application on Azion's edge. Go to the [step-by-step guide](/en/documentation/products/guides/import-an-existing-project-from-github/). 
5. Complete the building journey as required.
