**Azion GitHub App** is a tool that connects your GitHub account with Azion's platform. This application enables you to import your GitHub repositories and use them to build, deploy, and manage applications on the Azion Web Platform.

This documentation explains how this application works and how to manage it according to your preferences.

## Connecting Azion with your GitHub account

By using **Azion Web Platform**, you can build, deploy, and manage applications based on an existing project imported from GitHub. For this, you must have an Azion account and a GitHub account.

Then, it's necessary to connect your Azion account with GitHub through [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com). This way, you can grant permissions to Azion's platform to import your existing repositories.

You can connect Azion with your GitHub account in two moments:

- When *signing up with GitHub*.
- When [deploying a template](/en/documentation/products/marketplace/templates/) or [importing a project for GitHub](/en/documentation/products/guides/import-an-existing-project-from-github/).

In both scenarios, you'll be requested to confirm the installation of the Azion GitHub App and define your permissions and repository access as desired.

:::tip
For more details, check the [How to import an existing project to build an application](/en/documentation/products/guides/import-an-existing-project-from-github/) and [How to create an account on Azion](/en/documentation/products/accounts/creating-account/) guides.
:::

After you finish the installation of the Azion GitHub App, you can find it as part of your installed applications in the **Settings** of your GitHub account. Check the [Managing the Azion GitHub App](#managing-the-azion-github-app) section for more details.

## Permissions and features

### Account permissions

Azion GitHub App can be installed on both organizations and personal GitHub accounts. The user needs to select the account to be connected to Azion's platform when requested in the pop-up window that appears during the authorization process.

To install a GitHub App as an organization, you must be the organization owner or have admin permissions in a repository. Additionally, only owners can manage the settings of installed apps as an organization.

By installing the Azion GitHub App, the application can verify your GitHub identity and has read access to code, metadata, and resources you can access in your account.

### Git Scopes

After the installation and authorization through Azion Console, the selected **Git Scope** will be visible on the screen to indicate the account that is being used to create a new application. To select a different Git Scope, click the dropdown menu and select a different one.

### Repository permissions

It's possible to give access to all repositories stored in your account or select specific repositories that the Azion GitHub App will have access to.

You can define this permission during the installation of the Azion GitHub App through Console. However, you can edit these settings at any time as explained in the [Reviewing and editing Azion GitHub App configurations](#reviewing-and-editing-azion-github-app-configurations) section. 

### Continuous deployment

After installing the Azion GitHub App, you'll have a continuous deployment workflow when updating your application or repository. This way, every time you push code changes to your GitHub repository, those changes will be automatically deployed to your Azion's edge environment, and vice versa, ensuring that your projects stay up-to-date.

## Managing the Azion GitHub App

When you authorize and install the Azion GitHub App through Console, it appears as an *installed application* in your GitHub Account. To verify if the application was successfully connected and installed in your account, proceed as follows:

1. Log in to your [GitHub account](https://github.com/login).
2. Go to the **Account menu**, located in the upper-right corner and identified with your avatar.
3. Click the **Settings** option and a new page will open.
4. On the left menu, select **Applications** in the **Integrations** section.
5. A list of your GitHub Applications will be displayed.

The list of applications includes three tabs:

- **Installed GitHub Apps**: all the installed GitHub Apps.
- **Authorized GitHub Apps**: GitHub Apps with access to your account.
- **Authorized OAuth Apps**: OAuth Apps with access to your account.

Read more about [GitHub Apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps) in the official GitHub documentation.

### Reviewing and editing Azion GitHub App configurations 

On the **Installed GitHub Apps** list:

1. Find the Azion GitHub App.
2. Click the **Configure** button.
- It'll open a page with information related to the application.

You can read the description and **Permissions** granted, as well as review and edit the **Repository access** settings. At the bottom of the page, you'll find the **Danger zone** section with options to suspend and uninstall the App. 

### Suspending Azion GitHub App access to the account resources

On the **Installed GitHub Apps** list:

1. Find the Azion GitHub App.
2. Click the **Configure** button.
3. On the **Danger zone** section, click the **Suspend** button.
- A modal will appear requesting to confirm the action. 

Now the Azion GitHub App won't have more access to your account resources.

Afterward, a **Unsuspend** button will be displayed. You can click on it to revert the suspension.

### Uninstalling the Azion GitHub App

On the **Installed GitHub Apps** list:

1. Find the Azion GitHub App.
2. Click the **Configure** button.
3. On the *Danger zone* section, click the **Uninstall** button.
- A modal will appear requesting to confirm the action.

This removes the app and revokes access to all your account resources. 

To reinstall the application, you need to complete the process as explained in the [How to connect your Azion account with GitHub](#connecting-azion-with-your-github-account) section.

### Revoking Azion GitHub App access to the account

On the **Authorized GitHub Apps** list:

1. Find the Azion GitHub App and click the **Revoke** button.
- A modal will appear requesting to confirm the action and informing this action can't be undone.

With this action, the Azion GitHub App will no longer be able to access the GitHub API.
