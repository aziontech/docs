To create an edge service, proceed as follows:

1. Go to [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. On the top-left corner, select the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, and then **Edge Libraries** > **Edge Services**.
3. Click on the **Add Service** button.
> Your service will be created automatically. You can change the name of the service by clicking on **My New Service** in the name bar.
4. Go to the **Resources** tab and click **Add Resource**.
5. Configure the resources you need for your service, using the triggers: "*Install*", "*Reload*", and "*Uninstall*".
6. **Optional**: where you've used variables in the content of one or more resources, you can set the default values for them in the **Environment** tab.
> The variables must be in the format `Variable = Value`, where `Variable` has been used in the content of resources that are already registered.
7. Activate the service and click on the **Save** button.

Done. Now your service can use one or more edge nodes.
