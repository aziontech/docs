## Installing

1. Generate a credential to run the actions:

   > To generate the credential required to authenticate your edge nodes, follow the steps in the [credentials documentation](/en/documentation/products/credentials/).
2. Install the **Edge Orchestrator** agent on the devices.
3. Authenticate the device after installation.

To begin the **Edge Node** installation process, you must download the **Edge Orchestrator** installation binary of your choice.

Download the Azion Edge Node option that matches your platform of use:

| Operating System | Architecture | File                                                         |
| :--------------- | :----------: | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| FreeBSD          |    x86_64    | [edge-orchestrator](https://downloads.azion.com/freebsd/x86_64/edge-orchestrator) |
| FreeBSD          |    ARM64     | [edge-orchestrator](https://downloads.azion.com/freebsd/arm64/edge-orchestrator) |
| Linux            |    x86_32    | [edge-orchestrator](https://downloads.azion.com/linux/x86_32/edge-orchestrator) |
| Linux            |    x86_64    | [edge-orchestrator](https://downloads.azion.com/linux/x86_64/edge-orchestrator) |
| Linux            |    ARM32     | [edge-orchestrator](https://downloads.azion.com/linux/arm32/edge-orchestrator) |
| Linux            |    ARM64     | [edge-orchestrator](https://downloads.azion.com/linux/arm64/edge-orchestrator) |
| MacOS            |    x86_64    | [edge-orchestrator](https://downloads.azion.com/darwin/x86_64/edge-orchestrator) |

Alternatively, you can download it using the Command line. In the example, the download link refers to the Linux/x86_64 agent. If you want to download another version, just change the URL for the required operating system or architecture:

`curl -O http://downloads.azion.com/linux/x86_64/edge-orchestrator`

> **Note**: The commands executed in the edge-orchestrator agent must be executed with root user privileges. It might be necessary to run the commands with `sudo`.

The root user is the one who has unrestricted access to all system components, whether files or processes. If you don't have these privileges, you may experience installation failures when attempting to manage some operating system requirements that demand such privileges.

After downloading, follow the steps below to install the **Edge Orchestrator** agent to your device:

1. Install the **Edge Orchestrator** agent:<br />
   `chmod +x edge-orchestrator`<br />
   `./edge-orchestrator install`
2. Enter the **Token** for the Edge Orchestrator agent.
3. Start the **Edge Orchestrator** agent after installing it:<br />
   `edge-orchestrator start`<br />
   **Note**: if your operating system doesn't have a service manager (such as `systemd`), you must run it in the foreground.<br />
   `edge-orchestrator start --foreground`

> The *logs* to run the Edge Orchestrator agent are stored in: <br />`/var/log/azion/edge-orchestrator.log`

---

## Viewing your nodes

Whenever the installation code is run for any device and it has been authenticated by the Token, the edge nodes will be listed in [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).

To view the list of edge nodes created for your account, follow the steps below:

1. [Go to RTM](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. Open the **Edge Orchestration** item on the upper-left menu, represented by three horizontal lines, and select **Edge Node**.

> You can verify the listed items by checking the **HashId** column, as it contains the hash used to create and authenticate the edge node.

---

## Authorizing 

You must authorize your edge nodes to begin orchestrating them. To authorize an edge node, follow the steps below:

1. Open the list of **Edge Nodes** [in RTM](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. Click on the  **key icon** and accept the confirmation window.

> After the authorization, the **Edge Node** can take up to *10 seconds* before services can be orchestrated.

You can also authorize all the edge nodes you want at once. To start using this option, follow the steps below:

1. Open the list of Edge Nodes [in RTM](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. Select the items you want to authorize or, if you prefer, select all items by checking the first check box on the left.
3. On the top-right corner, click the **Actions** button and select **Authorize**.
4. A message to confirm your action will be shown.
5. Click the **Confirm** button to save your selection.
6. You'll see the following confirmation message: "*X nodes were successfully authorized!*"

---

## Services

You can provision the services registered in your library by following these steps:

1. Open the list of **Edge Nodes** [in RTM](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. Select the **Edge Node** that you want to configure.
3. Open the **Services** tab and click the **Add Service** button.
4. Link it to the service you want and, if necessary, you can configure the variables required by the service.

> Services that are due to be orchestrated via Edge Node must be registered in **Edge Libraries** > **Edge Services** and marked as active.

Once the service is provided, Edge Node can begin orchestrating it based on resource priorities. You can monitor the service installation process via logs in the Edge Orchestrator agent.

> The service installation logs are stored in <br/>`/var/log/azion/edge-services.log`
