:::caution[important]
Azion has two user interfaces: Real-Time Manager and Console, which is in *Preview* stage. Currently, Console is only available for Developer plans and new accounts. Follow the steps according to the user interface you're using.
:::

To create an edge service, proceed as follows:

<Tabs client:visible>
    <Fragment slot="tab.console">Console</Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.rtm">Real-Time Manager</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.console">
1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Edge Services**.
2. Click on the **+ Service** button.
3. Give a name for your service.
4. Define the variables, if necessary.
    - The variables must be in the format `Variable = Value`.
5. Click the **Save** button.
6. Go to the **Resources** tab.
7. Click the **+ Resource** button.
8. Provide the path where the resource will be saved on the edge node.
9. Select the type of resource: **Text** or **Shell Script**.
10. In case of selecting **Shell Script**, configure the resources you need for your service, using the triggers: **Install**, **Reload**, and **Uninstall**.
11. Add the content of the resource.
12. Click the **Save** button.

Done. Now your service can use one or more edge nodes.

<Fragment slot="panel.rtm">
1. Go to [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. On the top-left corner, select the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, and then **Edge Libraries** > **Edge Services**.
3. Click on the **Add Service** button.
    - Your service will be created automatically. You can change the name of the service by clicking on **My New Service** in the name bar.
4. Go to the **Resources** tab and click **Add Resource**.
5. Configure the resources you need for your service, using the triggers: **Install**, **Reload**, and **Uninstall**.
6. **Optional**: where you've used variables in the content of one or more resources, you can set the default values for them in the **Environment** tab.
    - The variables must be in the format `Variable = Value`, where `Variable` has been used in the content of resources that are already registered.
7. Activate the service and click on the **Save** button.

Done. Now your service can use one or more edge nodes.
