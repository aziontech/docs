## Installing

1. Generate a personal token to run the actions:

:::tip
To generate the personal token required to authenticate your edge nodes, follow the steps in the [Personal Token documentation](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/).
:::

2. Install the **Edge Orchestrator** agent on the devices.
3. Authenticate the device after installation.

To begin the **Edge Node** installation process, you must download the **Edge Orchestrator** installation binary of your choice.

Download the Azion Edge Node option that matches your platform of use:

| Operating System | Architecture | File                                                         |
| :--------------- | :----------: | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| FreeBSD          |    x86_64    | [edge-orchestrator](https://downloads.azion.com/freebsd/x86_64/edge-orchestrator) |
| FreeBSD          |    ARM64     | [edge-orchestrator](https://downloads.azion.com/freebsd/arm64/edge-orchestrator) |
| Linux            |    x86_32    | [edge-orchestrator](https://downloads.azion.com/linux/x86_32/edge-orchestrator) |
| Linux            |    x86_64    | [edge-orchestrator](https://downloads.azion.com/linux/x86_64/edge-orchestrator) |
| Linux            |    ARM32     | [edge-orchestrator](https://downloads.azion.com/linux/arm32/edge-orchestrator) |
| Linux            |    ARM64     | [edge-orchestrator](https://downloads.azion.com/linux/arm64/edge-orchestrator) |
| MacOS            |    x86_64    | [edge-orchestrator](https://downloads.azion.com/darwin/x86_64/edge-orchestrator) |

Alternatively, you can download it using the Command line. In the example, the download link refers to the Linux/x86_64 agent. If you want to download another version, just change the URL for the required operating system or architecture:

`curl -O http://downloads.azion.com/linux/x86_64/edge-orchestrator`

:::note 
The commands executed in the edge-orchestrator agent must be executed with root user privileges. It might be necessary to run the commands with `sudo`.
:::

The root user is the one who has unrestricted access to all system components, whether files or processes. If you don't have these privileges, you may experience installation failures when attempting to manage some operating system requirements that demand such privileges.

After downloading, follow the steps below to install the **Edge Orchestrator** agent to your device:

1. Install the **Edge Orchestrator** agent:<br />
   `chmod +x edge-orchestrator`<br />
   `./edge-orchestrator install`
2. Enter the **Token** for the Edge Orchestrator agent.
3. Start the **Edge Orchestrator** agent after installing it:<br />
   `edge-orchestrator start`<br />
   **Note**: if your operating system doesn't have a service manager (such as `systemd`), you must run it in the foreground.<br />
   `edge-orchestrator start --foreground`

:::note 
The *logs* to run the Edge Orchestrator agent are stored in: <br />`/var/log/azion/edge-orchestrator.log`
:::

## Viewing your nodes

Whenever the installation code is run for any device and it has been authenticated by the Token, the edge nodes will be listed in your Azion account.

To view the list of edge nodes created for your account, follow the steps below:

<Tabs client:visible>
    <Fragment slot="tab.console">Console</Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.rtm">Real-Time Manager</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.console">
1. Go to [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com/).
2. On the upper-left corner of the page, open the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, and select **Edge Nodes**.

You can verify the listed items by checking the **HashId** column, as it contains the hash used to create and authenticate the edge node.
</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.rtm">
1. Go to [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).
2.  On the upper-left corner of the page, open the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, and select **Edge Nodes**.

You can verify the listed items by checking the **HashId** column, as it contains the hash used to create and authenticate the edge node.
</Fragment>

</Tabs>

## Authorizing 

You must authorize your edge nodes to begin orchestrating them. To authorize an edge node, follow the steps below:

<Tabs client:visible>
    <Fragment slot="tab.console">Console</Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.rtm">Real-Time Manager</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.console">
1. Open the list of **Edge Nodes** in [Console](https://console.azion.com).
2. Click on the **key icon** and accept the confirmation window.

After the authorization, the **Edge Node** can take up to *10 seconds* before services can be orchestrated.
</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.rtm">
1. Open the list of **Edge Nodes** in [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. Click on the  **key icon** and accept the confirmation window.

After the authorization, the **Edge Node** can take up to *10 seconds* before services can be orchestrated.
</Fragment>

</Tabs>

You can also authorize all the edge nodes you want at once. To start using this option, follow the steps below:

<Tabs client:visible>
    <Fragment slot="tab.console">Console</Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.rtm">Real-Time Manager</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.console">
1. Open the list of Edge Nodes in [Console](https://console.azion.com/).
2. Select the items you want to authorize or, if you prefer, select all items by checking the first check box on the left.
3. On the top-right corner, click the **Actions** button and select **Authorize**.
4. A message to confirm your action will be shown.
5. Click the **Confirm** button to save your selection.
6. You'll see a confirmation message.
</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.rtm">
1. Open the list of Edge Nodes in [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. Select the items you want to authorize or, if you prefer, select all items by checking the first check box on the left.
3. On the top-right corner, click the **Actions** button and select **Authorize**.
4. A message to confirm your action will be shown.
5. Click the **Confirm** button to save your selection.
6. You'll see the following confirmation message: "*X nodes were successfully authorized!*"
</Fragment>

</Tabs>

## Services

You can provision the services registered in your library by following these steps:

<Tabs client:visible>
    <Fragment slot="tab.console">Console</Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.rtm">Real-Time Manager</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.console">
1. Open the list of **Edge Nodes** in [Console](https://console.azion.com/).
2. Select the **Edge Node** that you want to configure.
3. Open the **Services** tab and click the **+ Service** button.
4. Link it to the service you want and, if necessary, you can configure the variables required by the service.
</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.rtm">
1. Open the list of **Edge Nodes** in [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. Select the **Edge Node** that you want to configure.
3. Open the **Services** tab and click the **Add Service** button.
4. Link it to the service you want and, if necessary, you can configure the variables required by the service.
</Fragment>

</Tabs>

Services that are due to be orchestrated via Edge Node must be registered in **Edge Libraries** > **Edge Services** and marked as active.

Once the service is provided, Edge Node can begin orchestrating it based on resource priorities. You can monitor the service installation process via logs in the Edge Orchestrator agent.

:::note 
The service installation logs are stored in <br/>`/var/log/azion/edge-services.log`
