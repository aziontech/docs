Azion **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** can operate in two different modes *learning* and *blocking*. When in learning mode, WAF analyzes threats without actually blocking them. When in blocking mode, all requests considered as threats are blocked and don't even reach the server (origin).

The learning mode (or *calibration stage*) helps to improve WAF services and reduce false positives. Blocking mode will provide real-time protection against all supported threat families.

:::tip
Check the list of all [threat families](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-firewall/web-application-firewall/) that WAF can protect your applications from.
:::

This documentation will guide you on how to create, locate, and edit the operation mode of a WAF Rule Set configuration.

> WAF Rule Set is how a WAF configuration instance is called.

## Requirements

The WAF operation mode is set on the **Rules Engine** tab of an **Edge Firewall** configuration. Make sure you have:

- An [edge firewall](/en/documentation/products/guides/secure/edge-firewall-configure-main-settings/) associated with the domains of your edge applications.
- This edge firewall should have at least one [WAF Rule Set](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-firewall/web-application-firewall/rules-set/). 

If you don't have a configured WAF Rule Set, check [this guide](/en/documentation/products/guides/secure/create-waf-rule-set/) for more details.
