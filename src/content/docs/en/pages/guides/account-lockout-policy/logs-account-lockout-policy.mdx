## Checking Account Lockout Policy logs

:::note
To check the Account Lockout Policy logs, you must have *Account Owner* privileges.

If you aren't an *Account Owner* or if the account doesn't have the policy activated, the system returns an *Error 403*.
:::

1. Run the following `GET` request in your terminal to retrieve the data of blocked users.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.azion.com/v4/identity/users?locked=true \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: 123'
```

2. You'll receive a response similar to this:

```bash
{
  "count": 2,
  "results": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      ...
      "lockout": {
        "locked_at": "20240101T10:20:01",
        "unlock_at": "20240102T10:20:01",
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Where:

| Key | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `count` | Represents the number of blocked user accounts. Example: `2` |
| `id` | Represents the unique identifier for a user |
| `lockout` | Integer | Represents the period during which the user account will be blocked, with `locked_at` being the timestamp for the start and `unlock_at` indicating when the lockout will end |

3. Additionally, you can also run the following `GET` request in your terminal to retrieve the data of allowed users.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.azion.com/v4/identity/users?locked=false \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: 123'
```

4. You'll receive a response similar to this:

```bash
{
  "count": 2,
  "results": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      ...
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
