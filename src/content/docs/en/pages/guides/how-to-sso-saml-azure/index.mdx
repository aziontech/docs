Identity Provider (IdP) is a trusted entity that allows you to enable single sign-on to access other sites or services, such as Azion. Your users can continue using their corporate user identities without having to remember a specific password or enter credentials each time they access **Real-Time Manager (RTM)**.

Azure AD is an example of an Identity Provider.

> Even if you're using an IdP, it’s necessary to register all users of the account on RTM as they are synced in both RTM and IdP. An inexistent user on RTM won’t be able to log in to it.

When using an IdP, you have two protocol possibilities: Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) and OpenID Connect (OIDC).

To set up an Azure AD custom SAML app as your account IdP for RTM, follow the next steps.

2. On the homepage, under **Azure Services**, select **Enterprise applications**. 
3. Click **+ New Application**.
4. On the next page, search for **Azure AD SAML Toolkit** and select it. Once you select it, a window will open with the **Azure AD SAML Toolkit** details on the right side of the screen.
6. Click **Create** on the bottom of the window. The app will be installed. 
7. On the left side menu, select **Single sign-on**.
8. Under **Select a single sign-on method**, click **SAML**.
9. On the left side menu, select **Properties**.
10. In the option **Assignment required?**, select **No**.

14. Click the context menu represented by three dots, and download the Certificate in the Base64 format. 
15. Click **Save**.

## Configuring the Identity Provider on RTM

> You must be the Account Owner on RTM to perform these settings.

1. Log in to [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. On the upper-right corner of the page, select the avatar menu. This is the **Account menu**.
3. Select **SSO Management**.
4. Click the **Add Identity Provider** button and select **SAML**.
5. On the **Identity Provider** page, choose a name that identifies your identity provider.
6. Fill in the following fields with the data copied from the Azure AD portal:

- Identity provider’s Entity ID URI.
- Sign-in URL.
- Certificate. It must include the —-BEGIN CERTIFICATE—- and —-END CERTIFICATE—- parts.

7. Click **Save**. You'll be redirected to the list of identity providers, where you can view all the providers created in your account.

## Completing the registration of the APP on Azure AD

1. On the **SSO Management** page of RTM:

- Find the box of your recently created identity provider.
- Click the context menu, represented by three dots > **Edit**.

> **Important**: don't click **Activate and turn on identity Origin** before you complete the configuration on the Azure AD portal.

2. On the **Identity Provider** page, you’ll need to copy the following information to finish the configuration on the Azure AD portal:

- Assertion Consumer Service URL.
- Service Provider's Entity ID URI.
- Sign-in URL.

3. On the Azure AD portal, return to the **Single sign-on** section, selecting it from the left side menu. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** box, click **Edit** and provide the following information:

- In the **Identifier** field, paste the Service Provider's Entity ID URI you’ve copied from RTM.
- In the **Reply URL** field, paste the Assertion Consumer Service URL you’ve copied from RTM.
- In the **Sign on URL** field, paste the Sign-in URL you’ve copied from RTM.

4. Click **Save**. 
5. On the **Attributes & Claims** box, click **Edit**.
6. In the **Unique User Identifier**, set the string *user.email*.
7. Click **Save**.

## Adding users on the Azure AD custom SAML app

After setting the service provider details:

1. Go to **Users and groups** on the left side menu.
2. Click **+ Add user/group** to add the users you wish to grant permission to access RTM using the IdP you've just created. 

---

## Turning on the Identity Provider on RTM

1. Back on RTM, access the [SSO Management](https://manager.azion.com/iam/sso/identity-providers) page.
2. On the box of the Identity Provider you've added, click **Activate and turn on identity Origin** and then click **Confirm**.

Now all the users of the account will be able to access RTM using Azure AD as the Identity Provider.

> This doesn’t apply to Account Owner users.

> **Important**: when the IdP app is activated, the Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) stops being verified by RTM and starts to be authenticated by the IdP. If the account returns to RTM's SSO, it'll use the last active status of the MFA.
