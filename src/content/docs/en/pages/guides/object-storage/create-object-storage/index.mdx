**Edge Storage** allows you to create buckets and integrate your object storage with your edge infrastructure. This guide covers how to create, modify, and delete a bucket using the [Azion API](https://api.azion.com).

<Button href="/en/documentation/products/store/object-storage/" text="go to Edge Storage reference" variant="secondary"></Button>

Read [How to upload and download objects from an Azion Edge Storage bucket](/en/documentation/products/guides/upload-and-download-objects-from-bucket/) to learn about object operations.

## Creating a read-only bucket via API

Run the following `POST` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and `name` with the desired bucket name to create a new read-only bucket:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azion.com/v4/storage/buckets' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--data '{
    "name": "my-bucket-ro",
    "edge-access": "read_only"
}'
```

You should receive the following response:

```json
{
  "state": "executed",
  "data": {
    "name": "my-bucket-ro",
    "edge_access": "read_only"
  }
}
```

Now you can use the bucket name to [upload and download objects](/en/documentation/products/guides/upload-and-download-objects-from-bucket/) from the bucket.

## Attributing read-write permission to bucket

Run the following `PATCH` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and `bucket_name` with the name of the bucket to attribute the read-write permission:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azion.com/v4/storage/buckets/<bucket_name>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--data '{
    "edge-access": "read_write"
}'
```

You should receive the following response:

```json
{
  "state": "executed",
  "data": {
    "name": "my-bucket-ro",
    "edge_access": "read_write"
  }
}
```

---

## Removing bucket

Run the following `DELETE` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and `bucket_name` with the name of the bucket you want to delete:

```bash
curl --location --request DELETE 'https://api.azion.com/v4/storage/buckets/<bucket_name>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]'
```

:::note
This operation can only be executed if the bucket is empty.
