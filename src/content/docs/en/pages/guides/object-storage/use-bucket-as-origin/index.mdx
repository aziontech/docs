**Azion Edge Storage** allows you to create buckets and use them as a source of content through [Origins](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/origins/#edge-storage). This guide covers how to create and serve a static application retrieved from an Edge Storage bucket using the [Azion API](https://api.azion.com) and [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com).

:::note
You can also use the `async storage.get(key)` method from the [Runtime API](/en/documentation/devtools/runtime/api-reference/storage/#async-storagegetkey) to serve the application using an **Edge Function** instead.

See the guides on [How to create and modify an Azion Edge Storage bucket](/en/documentation/products/guides/create-and-modify-bucket/) for bucket operations and [How to upload and download objects from an Azion Edge Storage bucket](/en/documentation/products/guides/upload-and-download-objects-from-bucket/) for object operations.

## Create a bucket and upload files

This section describes how you can upload objects to a bucket and maintain project structure using the [Azion API](https://api.azion.com). In this scenario, you'll create a static application using two files, distributed into folders as follows:

```txt
src/index.html
src/styles/style.css
```

1. Create the following `index.html` file inside of a local `src` directory:

```html title="src/index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>I am an object from a bucket.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

2. Now create the `style.css` file, which is referenced in the HTML, under the `styles` folder in the same directory:

```css title="src/styles/style.css"
body {
background-color: black;
}

h1, p {
    color: #F3652B;
}
```

3. Run the following `POST` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and `name` with the desired bucket name to create a read-write bucket:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azion.com/v4/storage/buckets' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--data '{
    "name": "app-origin",
    "edge-access": "read_write"
}'
```

4. You should receive the following response:

```json
{
  "state": "executed",
  "data": {
    "name": "app-origin",
    "edge-access": "read_write"
  }
}
```

5. Run the following `POST` requests in your terminal for each file, replacing `<bucket_name>` with the name of the bucket you just created:

    - For the `index.html` file, run the following command using `src/index.html` as the object key, and adding the object path as data:

    ```bash
    curl --location 'https://api.azion.com/v4/storage/buckets/<bucket_name>/objects/src/index.html' \
    --header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
    --header 'Content-Type: text/html' \
    --header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
    --data '@./src/index.html'
    ```

    - For the `styles.css` file, run the following command using `src/styles/style.css` as the object key, and adding the object path as data:

    ```bash
    curl --location 'https://api.azion.com/v4/storage/buckets/<bucket_name>/objects/src/styles/style.css' \
    --header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
    --header 'Content-Type: text/css' \
    --header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
    --data '@./src/styles/style.css'
    ```

6. You should receive the following responses for the files:

```json
{
    "state": "executed",
    "data": {
        "object_key": "src/index.html"
    }
}
```

```json
{
    "state": "executed",
    "data": {
        "object_key": "src/styles/style.css"
    }
}
```

## Create an edge application and set origin type to Edge Storage

Now that your bucket is populated with files, you can create a new edge application and a domain to set the bucket as the origin of the content and serve these objects.

### Via RTM

To facilitate this process, use the [Edge Application Proxy](/en/documentation/products/guides/edge-application-proxy-template/) template:

1. Access [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).
    - If you don't have an account yet, create a new one [by visiting the sign-up page](https://manager.azion.com/signup/).
2. On the homepage, select the **Start with a template** option.
3. Find the **Edge Application Proxy** card and select it.
4. Click the **Settings** tab to open the configuration form.
5. Give your application an easy-to-remember name.
6. In **Origin Address**, type `httpbin.org`. 
    - This is a temporary origin that will later be replaced with an Edge Storage origin.
7. In **Route to bypass**, type `/` to specify the root path of the application.
8. Wait for the deployment process to finish.
9. Copy the domain of the application, in the format `http://xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/`.

:::note
The link to the edge application allows you to see it on the browser. However, it takes a certain time to propagate and configure the application in Azionâ€™s edge locations. It may be necessary to wait a few minutes for the URL to be activated and for the application page to be effectively displayed in the browser.
:::

Now you need to configure a new **Edge Storage** origin and determine that your application should retrieve content from the bucket and prefix you created. To do so:

1. [Access RTM](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/) > **Edge Application**.
2. Click the proxy application you created in the previous steps.
3. Navigate to the **Origins** tab.
4. Click the **Add Origin** button.
5. Give your origin an easy-to-remember name.
6. In **Origin Type**, select **Edge Storage**.
7. In **Bucket Name**, add the name of the bucket you created in the previous steps.
8. In **Prefix**, add `/src`, which is the prefix you added to the object keys uploaded previously.
9. Click the **Save** button.

To activate the origin in your edge application:

10. Navigate to the **Rules Engine** tab.
11. Select the **Default Rule**.
12. Under **Behaviors**, in the **Set Origin** behavior, replace the **Default Origin** with the origin you created for your bucket.
13. Click the **Save** button.
14. Wait some time for the changes to propagate to the edge.

Once the changes have been made, access `http://xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/index.html` to see the HTML file you uploaded with the applied CSS style.

### Via API

1. Run the following `POST` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/):

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_applications' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "name": "edge storage app",
    "delivery_protocol": "http",
    "http3": false,
    "origin_type": "single_origin",
    "address": "httpbin.org",
    "origin_protocol_policy": "preserve",
    "host_header": "${host}",
    "browser_cache_settings": "honor",
    "browser_cache_settings_maximum_ttl": 0,
    "cdn_cache_settings": "overwrite",
    "cdn_cache_settings_maximum_ttl": 0
}'
```

2. You should receive a response similar to:

```json
{
    "results": {
        "id": <edge_application_id>,
        "name": "edge storage app",
        "delivery_protocol": "http"
        ...
    },
    "schema_version": 3
}
```

3. Copy the value from the `edge_application_id` field and paste it in a text editing app to save it for later requests.
4. Run the following `POST` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and `<edge_application_id>` with the ID of the edge application you created:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/domains' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "name": "edge storage domain"
    "cname_access_only": false,
    "digital_certificate_id": null,
    "edge_application_id": <edge_application_id>
}'
```

5. You should receive a response similar to:

```json
{
    "results": {
        "id": <domain_id>,
        "name": "edge storage domain",
        ...
        "edge_application_id": <edge_application_id>,
        "is_active": true,
        "domain_name": "xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net",
        ...
    },
    "schema_version": 3
}
```

6. Copy the URL in the `domain_name` value and paste it in a text editing app to access later. 
7. Run the following `POST` request to create an edge storage origin for the application, replacing `bucket` with the name of the bucket you created:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_applications/<edge_application_id>/origins' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "name": "edge storage origin",
    "origin_type": "object_storage",
    "bucket": "app-origin",
    "prefix": "/src"
}'
```

8. You should receive a response similar to:

```json
{
  "results": {
    "origin_id": <origin_id>,
    "origin_key": "bdcd7003-ba53-4ed8-8ca0-05b1357cdafd",
    "name": "New Edge Storage origin",
    "origin_type": "object_storage",
    ...
    "bucket": "new-bucket-rw",
    "prefix": "/"
  },
  "schema_version": 3
}
```

9. Copy the value from the `origin_id` field and paste it in a text editing app to save it for later requests.
10. Run the following `GET` request in your terminal to retrieve the ID of the default rule of your edge application's **Rules Engine**, replacing `<edge_application_id>` variable with the edge application ID you copied previously:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_applications/<edge_application_id>/rules_engine/request/rules' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]'
```

11. You should receive a response similar to:

```json
{
    ...
    "results": [
        {
            "id": <rule_id>,
            "name": "Default Rule",
            "phase": "default",
            "behaviors": [
                {
                    "name": "set_origin",
                    "target": "<origin_id>"
                },
                {
                    "name": "set_cache_policy",
                    "target": "<cache_setting_id>"
                }
            ],
            ...
            "description": ""
        }
    ]
}
```

12. Copy the value from the `rule_id` field and paste it in a text editing app to save it for later requests.
13. Run the following `PATCH` request to modify the default rule, replacing `<rule_id>` with the ID of the rule you retrieved in the previous step, leaving the `set_cache_policy` object the same as received in the response:

```bash
curl --location --request PATCH 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_applications/<edge_application_id>/rules_engine/phase/rules/<rule_id>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token azion12d49b3ff51f32313f9c7f8b77a02bf0e69' \
--data '{
    "behaviors": [
        {
            "name": "set_origin",
            "target": "<origin_id>"
        },
        {
            "name": "set_cache_policy",
            "target": "<cache_setting_id>"
        }
    ]
}'
```

14. Wait some time for the changes to propagate.

Once the changes have been made, access the domain you created, in the format `http://xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/index.html`, to see the HTML file you uploaded with the applied CSS style.
