**Edge Storage** offers compatibility with the S3 protocol through credentials. When you create a credential for any bucket that you own, you'll get an access key and a secret key to set up permissions for operations. Access to your bucket through the S3 protocol will be verified using the credential.

The S3 protocol allows you to access buckets and objects using an Edge Storage URL. This configuration facilitates file operations through command line interface (CLI) tools, such as [s3cmd](https://s3cmd.org), database services, or functions.

## Create a credential via API

1. Run the following `POST` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and the `<edge_application_id>` variable with [your edge application ID](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/configure-main-settings/):

```curl
curl --location 'https://api.azion.com/v4/storage/s3-credentials' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "name": "my-s3-credential",
    "capabilities": [
        "listAllBucketNames",
        "listBuckets",
        "listFiles",
        "readFiles",
        "writeFiles",
        "deleteFiles"
    ],
    "bucket": "<bucket_name>",
    "expiration_date": "<datetime>"
}'
```

:::note
The date and time of the request must be in UTC ISO 8601 standard: `YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00Z`
:::

2. You should receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
    "state": "executed",
    "data": {
        "name": "my-s3-credential",
        "access_key": "<s3_credential_access_key>",
        "secret_key": "<s3_credential_secret_key>", // this value can no longer be accessed in subsequent GET requests
        "capabilities": [
            "listAllBucketNames",
            "listBuckets",
            "listFiles",
            "readFiles",
            "writeFiles",
            "deleteFiles"
        ],
        "bucket": "<bucket_name>",
        "expiration_date": "<datetime>",
        "created_at": "<datetime>"
    }
}
```

3. Copy the values of the `access_key` and `secret_key` to set up access thorugh the S3 protocol.

## Configure access to the bucket through s3cmd

[s3cmd](https://s3cmd.org) is a command line interface tool for managing S3 and other cloud storage services. It can be used to manage objects on **Edge Storage** and other S3-compatible storage services. To use s3cmd to manage your Edge Storage bucket, follow these steps:

1. Download and install s3cmd through the [official website](https://s3cmd.org/download).
2. Make sure `s3cmd` is added to your system's PATH.
3. Run `s3cmd --configure` and enter the access key and secret key.
4. Enter the default region for the Edge Storage region: `us-east-005`.
5. Enter the endpoint URL for Edge Storage: `s3.us-east-005.azionstorage.net`.
6. Use the default DNS template: `%(bucket)s.s3.amazonaws.com`.
7. Inform an encryption password and a path to GPG program if needed.
8. Deactivate the HTTPS protocol by typing `false` or `no`.
9. Inform HTTP proxy servers if needed.
10. Press `y` to test access.

If your access and secret keys are correct, you should get the following success message:

```bash
Please wait, attempting to list all buckets...
Success. Your access key and secret key worked fine :-)
```

You can save your settings into an `.s3cfg` file if needed and modify them again using `s3cmd --configure`. Run the command `s3cmd --help` to see all available commands.
