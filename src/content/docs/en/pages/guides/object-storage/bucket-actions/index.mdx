**Azion Edge Storage** allows you to create buckets and integrate your object storage with your edge infrastructure. This guide covers how to upload and download objects from a bucket using the [Azion API](https://api.azion.com) and [Edge Runtime](/en/documentation/devtools/runtime/api-reference/storage/).

Read [How to create and modify an Azion Edge Storage bucket](/en/documentation/products/guides/create-and-modify-bucket/) for bucket operations.

## Via API

### Uploading an object to a bucket

To upload an object, run the following `POST` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/), `<bucket_name>` with the name of your bucket, `<object_key>` with an ID or name for the object, the `Content-Type` header with the MIME type being submitted, and the object sent as a data binary:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azion.com/v4/storage/buckets/<bucket_name>/objects/<object_key>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Content-Type: text/csv' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--data '@./path/file.csv'
```

You should receive the following response:

```json
{
    "state": "executed",
    "data": {
        "object_key": "folder/csv-file"
    }
}
```

### Downloading an object from a bucket

To download the object, run the following `GET` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/), `<bucket_name>` with the name of your bucket, and `<object_key>` with the key created for the object:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azion.com/v4/storage/buckets/<bucket_name>/objects/<object_key>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]'
```

You should now see the contents of the object in your terminal.

:::note
To download the object to your device locally, add the cURL options `-O` to use the header-provided object name and `-J` to write the output into a file, as follows:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azion.com/v4/storage/buckets/<bucket_name>/objects/<object_key> -O -J' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]'
```

When working with files that have a prefix in the object key, like `folder/file.csv`, using these options won't create a new directory. Instead, the file will be downloaded directly to the root folder where the command was initiated.

## Via Edge Runtime

You can create an edge function to upload objects to your bucket using a `POST` console command and see if an object is available using a `GET` console command. To do so:

1. Access [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/) > **Edge Functions**.
2. Click the **Add Function** button.
3. Name your function. Example: `my-bucket POST+GET`.
4. In the **Code** tab, add the following JavaScript code:

```js
import Storage from "azion:storage";
async function doGet(path, bucket_name) {
    console.log(`Path: ${path}`);
    const storage = new Storage(bucket_name);
    // content is an StorageObject
    const asset = await storage.get(path);
    return new Response(await asset.arrayBuffer(), {
        headers: {
            "Content-Type": asset.contentType
        },
    });
}

async function doPost(path, content_type, value, bucket_name) {
    console.log(`Path: ${path}`);
    let options = {
        "Content-Type": content_type
    }
    console.log(`Options: ${options}`);
    const storage = new Storage(bucket_name);
    await storage.put(path, value, options);
    return new Response("Object added.");
}

async function router(event) {
    const request = event.request;
    const method = request.method;
    const path = decodeURI(new URL(request.url).pathname);
    const bucket_name = event.args.bucket;
    if (method === "POST") {
        let content_type = request.headers.get("Content-Type");
        let content = await request.arrayBuffer();
        return doPost(path, content_type, content, bucket_name);
    } else if (method === "GET") {
        return doGet(path, bucket_name);
    } else {
        throw new Error(`Invalid method: ${method}. Expected POST or GET.`);
    }
}
addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {
    event.respondWith(
        router(event)
    );
});
```

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `path` | Path to the object. Example: `./path/file.csv` |
| `bucket_name` | The name of the bucket. Example: `my-bucket` |
| `content_type` | The MIME type of the object. Example: `text/csv` |
| `value` | The contents of the object as a data binary |

5. In the **Arguments** tab, add the object with the `bucket` property and, as a value, the name of the bucket as a string.

```json
{
  "bucket": "my-bucket"
}
```

6. Click the **Save** button.

:::note
See the [Edge Storage API](/en/documentation/devtools/runtime/api-reference/storage/) reference for more details on functions available for other types of requests.
:::

Once you have the edge function ready, you need to create an edge application that will proxy the upload process for the bucket.

1. Access [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. Select the **Start with a template** option on the homepage.
3. Select the **Build from scratch** option.
4. Give your application an easy-to-remember name. Example: `my-bucket Proxy`.
5. Select the option **Run a Function**.
6. In **Choose Edge Function**, select the edge function you created in the previous steps.
7. Click the **Next** button.
8. Copy the link of the edge application. It should be in the format `http://xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`.
9. Run the following command in your terminal to upload an object:

```
curl -v http://xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net ./path/file.csv txt/csv --data-binary @./path/file.csv my-bucket
```

10. Run the following command in your terminal to download an object:

```
curl -v http://xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net ./path/file.csv my-bucket
```
