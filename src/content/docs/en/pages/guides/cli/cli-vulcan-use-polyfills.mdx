Through [Azion CLI](/en/documentation/products/azion-cli/overview/), you can initialize an application based on starter templates or link an existing project. The list of supported web frameworks includes Next.js, React, Vue, Angular, Astro, JavaScript itself, and others. These JavaScript frameworks run at Azion's edge, on top of [Azion Runtime](/en/documentation/runtime/overview/).

The projects built with these frameworks typically use Node.js APIs. Through the Azion build process, carried by [Azion Bundler](https://github.com/aziontech/bundler), these APIs are resolved through the use of *polyfills*. 

This guide will show how to use **Node.js Buffer API** through polyfills in a JavaScript project by using Azion CLI and Azion Bundler.

---

## Requirements

Before getting started, you must have:

- An [Azion platform account](/en/documentation/products/accounts/creating-account/) with [Edge Functions](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-functions/) enabled.
- [The latest version of Azion CLI installed](/en/documentation/products/azion-cli/overview/).
- Code editor.
- Access to the terminal.
- Node.js ≥ 18.

---

## Initializing a JavaScript project on the edge

1. On the terminal, initialize the project:

```sh 
  azion init
```

2. Enter the name `polyfills-guide`:

```sh 
Your application s name:  (glorious-curiosity) polyfills-guide
```

3. Choose the JavaScript preset: 

:::tip
You can start typing the preset's name to filter the results.
:::

```sh 
? Choose a preset:  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
  Angular
  Astro
  Docusaurus
  Eleventy
  Emscripten
  Gatsby
  Hexo
  Hono
  Hugo
> Javascript
  Jekyll
  ...
```

4. Choose the `Hello World` template:

:::tip
You can start typing the template's name to filter the results.
:::

```sh
? Choose a template:  [Use arrows to move, type to filter]
  Azion Edge SQL
  Drizzle + Neon Sample
  Drizzle + TiDB Sample
  Drizzle + Turso Sample
  Edge Function GitHub AutoDeploy
  Fauna DB Boilerplate
> Hello World
  HTMX Boilerplate
  Simple Javascript Router Node
  ...
```

5. Enter `y` to start a local development server. 

6. Enter `y` to install project dependencies.  

7. Access the port that was returned in the terminal. Example:

```bash 
[Azion Bundler] [Server] › ✔  success   Function running on port 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000
``` 

8. Go back to the terminal and terminate the process.

9. Access your project: 

```bash
cd polyfills-guide
```

10. Open the `azion.config.js` file and modify the `build` properties in the `defineConfig` configuration object so it looks like this:

```js title="polyfills-guide/azion.config.js"
import { defineConfig } from 'azion';

export default defineConfig({
  build: {
    entry: 'main.js',
    preset: {
      name: 'javascript',
    },
    builder: 'webpack',
    polyfills: true,
  },
});
```

:::note
- **entry**: represents the primary entry point for your application where the build process begins. Not applicable for Jamstack solutions.
- **preset**: the name of the chosen preset.
- **builder**: defines the build tool to use, either `esbuild` or `webpack`.
- **polyfills**: specifies whether Node.js polyfills should be applied.
:::

11. After applying these settings, you can import the necessary APIs into your project. This example uses the Node.js Buffer API:

**Inside main.js**:

```js title="polyfills-guide/main.js"
// Import the Buffer class from the 'buffer' module in Node.js
import { Buffer } from 'node:buffer';

// Define a function named 'myWorker' that takes an event as an argument
export default function myWorker(event) {
  // Create a new Buffer instance 'buf1' from the string "x"
  var buf1 = Buffer.from("x");
  // Create a new Buffer instance 'buf2' from the string "x"
  var buf2 = Buffer.from("x");
  // Compare 'buf1' and 'buf2' using the Buffer.compare method,
  // which returns a number indicating the equality of the buffers
  var a = Buffer.compare(buf1, buf2);

  // The result will be 0 since both buffers are equal
  console.log(a);

  // Now, let's swap the values of 'buf1' and 'buf2'
  buf1 = Buffer.from("y");
  buf2 = Buffer.from("x");
  // Compare 'buf1' and 'buf2' again
  a = Buffer.compare(buf1, buf2);

  // Here, the result will be 1
  console.log(a);

  // The function returns a new Response object with the string "Testing buffer polyfills"
  return new Response("Testing polyfills");
}
```

12. Run the project locally by running: 

```bash 
azion dev
```

Now you can check the logs in the terminal and see the Buffer API working through polyfills. 

:::tip
You can access a list of APIs resolved through polyfills by Azion Bundler build on [its repository](https://github.com/aziontech/bundler) and on [Azion's compatibility documentation](/en/documentation/products/azion-edge-runtime/compatibility/node/). Azion Bundler's an **open-source** project and you can propose new presets and implementations.
