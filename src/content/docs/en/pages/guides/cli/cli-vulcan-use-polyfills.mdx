Through [Azion CLI](/en/documentation/products/azion-cli/overview/), you can initialize an application based on starter templates or link an existing project. The list of supported web frameworks includes Next.js, React, Vue, Angular, Astro, JavaScript itself, and others. These JavaScript frameworks run at Azion's edge, on top of [Azion Runtime](/en/documentation/runtime/overview/).

The projects built with these frameworks typically use Node.js APIs. Through the Azion build process, carried by [Vulcan](https://github.com/aziontech/vulcan), these APIs are resolved through the use of *polyfills*. 

This guide will show how to use **Node.js Buffer API** through polyfills in a JavaScript project by using Azion CLI and Vulcan.

---

## Requirements

Before getting started, you must have:

- An [Azion platform account](/en/documentation/products/accounts/creating-account/) with [Edge Functions](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-functions/) enabled.
- [The latest version of Azion CLI installed](/en/documentation/products/azion-cli/overview/).
- Code editor.
- Access to the terminal.
- Node.js ≥ 18.

## Initializing a JavaScript project on the edge

1. On the terminal, initialize the project:

```sh 
  azion init
```

2. Enter the name `polyfills-guide`:

```sh 
Your application s name:  (glorious-curiosity) polyfills-guide
```

3. Choose the JavaScript template: 

```sh 
Getting templates available? Choose a template for your project: (Use arrow keys)
 >Javascript
  Angular 
  Astro 
  Hexo 
  Next 
  React 
  Vue 
  Vite 
```

4. Enter `y` to start a local development server. 

5. Enter `y` to install project dependencies.  

6. Choose a package manager.

7. Access the port that was returned in the terminal. Example:

```bash 
[Vulcan] [Server] › ✔  success   Function running on port 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000
``` 

8. Go back to the terminal and terminate the process.

9. Access your project: 

```bash
cd polyfills-guide
```

10. Create the `vulcan.config.js` file and paste the following properties:

```js title="polyfills-guide/vulcan.config.js"
module.exports = {
  entry: 'main.js',
  builder: 'webpack',
  useNodePolyfills: true,
};
```

:::note
- **entry**: represents the primary entry point for your application where the build process begins. Not applicable for Jamstack solutions.
- **builder**: defines the build tool to use, either `esbuild` or `webpack`.
- **useNodePolyfills**: specifies whether Node.js polyfills should be applied.
:::

11. After applying these settings, you can import the necessary APIs into your project. This example uses the Node.js Buffer API:

**Inside main.js**:

```js title="polyfills-guide/main.js"
// Import the Buffer class from the 'buffer' module in Node.js
import { Buffer } from 'node:buffer';

// Define a function named 'myWorker' that takes an event as an argument
export default function myWorker(event) {
  // Create a new Buffer instance 'buf1' from the string "x"
  var buf1 = Buffer.from("x");
  // Create a new Buffer instance 'buf2' from the string "x"
  var buf2 = Buffer.from("x");
  // Compare 'buf1' and 'buf2' using the Buffer.compare method,
  // which returns a number indicating the equality of the buffers
  var a = Buffer.compare(buf1, buf2);

  // The result will be 0 since both buffers are equal
  console.log(a);

  // Now, let's swap the values of 'buf1' and 'buf2'
  buf1 = Buffer.from("y");
  buf2 = Buffer.from("x");
  // Compare 'buf1' and 'buf2' again
  a = Buffer.compare(buf1, buf2);

  // Here, the result will be 1
  console.log(a);

  // The function returns a new Response object with the string "Testing buffer polyfills"
  return new Response("Testing polyfills");
}
```

12. Run the project locally by running: 

```bash 
azion dev
```

Now you can check the logs in the terminal and see the Buffer API working through polyfills. 

:::tip
You can access a list of APIs resolved through polyfills by Vulcan build on [its repository](https://github.com/aziontech/vulcan) and on [Azion's compatibility documentation](/en/documentation/products/azion-edge-runtime/compatibility/node/). Vulcan's an **open-source** project and you can propose new presets and implementations.
