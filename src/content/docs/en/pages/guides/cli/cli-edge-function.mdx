Manage your edge functions using the **Azion CLI**. It's common for an edge application to use several functions present in an **Edge Library**.


## 1. Prerequisites

- Install Azion CLI.
- [Create a personal token](/en/documentation/products/accounts/personal-tokens/) or use an existing one that identifies you on the Azion's platform.

---

## 2. Listing you functions 

Initially, you can list the edge functions available in your library, including the pre-configured `Azion - Hello World` function.

To list your edge functions, run the command:

```bash
    azioncli edge_functions list
```

A list of your functions will be presented on the monitor, as in this example:

```bash
    ID      NAME                   LANGUAGE      ACTIVE
    3976    Azion - Hello World    javascript    true
    6598    func01                 javascript    true
```

The `azioncli edge_functions list` command responded with a table consisting of four columns:

- **ID**: unique identifier of the edge function on the Azion's platform.
- **NAME**: name of the function.
- **LANGUAGE**: programming language or framework of the function.
- **ACTIVE**: status of the function, which can be active (**true**) or inactive (**false**).

---

## 3. Creating an edge function

Create a new edge function directly from the **CLI**, without having to resort to **RTM**. Initially, we'll need a **JavaScript** file containing the function code. If you don't have a file in the current directory, create one with the command below:

```bash
    echo "alert('My new JavaScript function');" > my-func.js
```

After running the command, verify the creation of the `my-func.js` file with the `ls` command.

Now that you have a file with the JavaScript function, you can create your edge function with it. To do so, type the following command:

```bash
    azioncli edge_functions create --name my-new-ef --code ./my-func.js --active true
```

CLI response:

```bash
    Created Edge Function with ID 6823
```

The CLI responds with the **ID** of the newly created function. To confirm it, use the **list** command again:

```bash
    azioncli edge_functions list
```

CLI response:

```bash
    ID      NAME                   LANGUAGE      ACTIVE
    3976    Azion - Hello World    javascript    true
    6598    func01                 javascript    true
    6823    my-new-ef              javascript    true
```

Relative to the list in the previous example, this time the **list** command included the `my-new-ef` function with ID *6823*, created by the **create** command.

---

## 4. Deleting an edge function

To delete the newly created `my-new-ef` function, run the **delete** command with the **ID** parameter of the function:

```bash
    azioncli edge_functions delete --function-id 6823
```

CLI response:

```bash
    Edge Function 6823 was successfully deleted
```

Run the **list** command again. The CLI will present the following table:

```bash
    ID      NAME                   LANGUAGE      ACTIVE
    3976    Azion - Hello World    javascript    true
    6598    func01                 javascript    true
```

Note that the `my-new-ef` function, whose **ID** was *6823*, no longer appears in the list. As a suggestion, you can access **RTM** to analyze the results of the CLI commands presented in this example.
