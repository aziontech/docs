Azion Edge Applications require at least one origin. However, more complex and robust infrastructures and might need multiple origin configurations for the same application. The **Load Balancer** module allows you to use load balancing algorithms to manage high access numbers and control your origin behaviors.

By distributing network traffic efficiently across several servers, these algorithms ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed, thereby preventing potential system crashes. Furthermore, they enable smoother user experiences by reducing load times and ensuring efficient use of resources.

To create a load balancer origin for your edge application, you'll need:

- An [Azion account](link_accounts).
- An [edge application](link_build_with_edge_app).
- An [Azion domain](link_config_domain).

:::caution[warning]
If **Load Balancer** is activated, data transfer could generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/) for more information.
:::

You can customize which load balancing algorithm your application will apply. You can choose between three methods:

- **Round Robin**: works cycles requests among servers to ensure each one receives a request before it goes back to the first, assigning weights based on server capacity.
- **Least Connections**: tracks current server connections, preventing overloading by redistributing to others and applying capacity-based weight assignment, but focusing on current server connections.
- **IP Hash**: uses the client's and server's IP addresses to create a unique hash key for future reference, making the client return to the same server in future requests.

You can choose to create and modify your origin using [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](#via-rtm) or the [Azion API](#via-api).

## Via RTM

In this section, you'll modify your default origin, which is of the Single Origin type, into a Load Balancer type origin.

:::caution[warning]
This will override your default origin settings
:::

To configure an origin with **Load Balancer** through RTM:

1. [Access RTM](link_rtm).
2. On the upper-left corner of the page, open the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, and then select **Edge Application**.
3. Click the edge application for which you want to configure a new origin with load balancer.
4. On the **Main Settings** tab, under **Modules**, activate **Load Balancer**.
5. Click the **Save** button.

To edit the type of the default origin:

6. Select the **Origins** tab.
7. In the **Origins** tab, click the **Default Origin** button.
8. Give your new origin a name.
9. Under **Origin Type**, select **Load Balancer**.

Now, the following steps will walk you through customizing a Load Balancer type origin for three different origin servers with the Round Robin algorithm:

4. In the **Method** field, select **Round Robin**.
5. In the **Address** field, specify the origin of your content. For example, `example.com`.
6. In the **Weight** field, add a weight of `3` to this first origin.
7. In the **Server Role** field, keep **Primary** selected.
8. Keep this origin **Active**.
9. Add another origin by clicking the **+** button.
10. In the **Address** field, specify the second origin of your content. In this case, `example.net`.
11. In the **Weight** field, add a weight of `2` to this origin.
12. In the **Server Role** field, select **Backup**.
13. Keep this origin **Active**.
14. Add a third origin by clicking the **+** button.
15. In the **Address** field, specify the third origin of your content. In this case, `example.org`.
16. Keep the **Weight** field blank. It will assume a default value of `1`.
17. In the **Server Role** field, select **Primary**.
18. Disable this origin by turning off the **Active** switch.
19. Click the **Save** button.
