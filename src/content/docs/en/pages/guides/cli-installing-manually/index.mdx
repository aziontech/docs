To install the **CLI** manually, follow these steps:

1. Create a folder on your computer's file system where you want to run the CLI commands; for example: `my-cli`.

2. Download the desired architecture binary; the `azioncli` binary file is downloaded into the `Downloads` folder of the computer's file system.

| Operating System | Architecture | Azion CLI URL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS | x86_64 | [https://downloads.azion.com/darwin/x86_64/azion](https://downloads.azion.com/darwin/x86_64/azioncli) |
| macOS | ARM64 | [https://downloads.azion.com/darwin/arm64/azion](https://downloads.azion.com/darwin/arm64/azioncli) |
| FreeBSD&reg; <sup>7</sup> | x86_64 | [https://downloads.azion.com/freebsd/x86_64/azion](https://downloads.azion.com/freebsd/x86_64/azioncli) |
| FreeBSD | ARM64 | [https://downloads.azion.com/freebsd/arm64/azion](https://downloads.azion.com/freebsd/arm64/azioncli) |
| Linux&reg; <sup>8</sup>   | x86_32 | [https://downloads.azion.com/linux/x86_32/azion](https://downloads.azion.com/linux/x86_32/azioncli) |
| Linux | x86_64 | [https://downloads.azion.com/linux/x86_64/azion](https://downloads.azion.com/linux/x86_64/azioncli) |
| Linux | ARM32 | [https://downloads.azion.com/linux/arm32/azion](https://downloads.azion.com/linux/arm32/azioncli) |
| Linux | ARM64 | [https://downloads.azion.com/linux/arm64/azion](https://downloads.azion.com/linux/arm64/azioncli) |

Alternatively, you can download it via command line. In the example below, the link refers to the *Linux/x86_64* architecture. To use another architecture, change the URL to the desired operating system or architecture with the command below:

    `curl -O https://downloads.azion.com/linux/x86_64/azioncli`

3. Copy the `azioncli` file, downloaded in the previous step, to the folder created in step 1.
4. Open the terminal and change the working directory to the folder you created in step 1 by running the `cd <path>` command with the path of the `my-cli` folder on your computer.
5. Confirm the existence of the `azioncli` binary file in the project folder with the `ls` command.

     Terminal response:

         `azioncli`

6. Grant permission to run the `azioncli` binary on your computer with the following command:

    `chmod +x azioncli`

If the terminal doesn't display any messages, it means that the command was executed without errors.

**Note**: if your computer uses the macOS operating system, it'll present a window with an error message preventing the execution of the CLI. See the procedure to [allow the CLI to run on the macOS operating system](/en/documentation/products/guides/cli-running-macos/), presented later.

7. Run the command:

> **Note**: the command below allows you to run `azioncli` from any folder on your computer's file system. You can then delete the `azion` files in your project directory and the `Downloads` folder by running the `rm azion` command in the respective directories.

    `sudo cp azioncli /usr/local/bin`
  
This command is *optional*. In case you didn't want to run the `sudo cp azioncli /usr/local/bin` command, remember to have a copy of the `azion` binary in your project folder and run it with the characters `./` in front, as in `./azion <command>`. Otherwise, an error message will be displayed stating that the `azion` command wasn't found.
    
The `sudo` command asks for the password of the user with computer administrator powers. Enter your password and press the **ENTER** or **RETURN** key. Characters aren't displayed while typing.

8. Test the **CLI** installation with the following command; a help screen will appear on the monitor.

    `azioncli --help`

If a window with an alert message appears on the screen informing you that the developer can't be identified, click on the **Cancel** button. The terminal responds with the following message:

    `zsh: killed azioncli --help`

Then, follow the steps in the [Running the CLI on macOS Operating System](/en/documentation/products/guides/cli-running-macos/) topic. After releasing the execution, rerun the command `azioncli --help` or `azioncli --version` to verify that Azion CLI is working normally.

If you use the `azioncli --version` command, the response should be similar to the one shown below, or a higher version:

    `azioncli version 0.46.0`

> **Note**: the CLI release process presented above is for the macOS operating system. If you use another operating system, follow the procedures provided in the system's documentation.

From now on you can run CLI commands. To help you, it has an interactive and integrated help system in order to facilitate its use.
