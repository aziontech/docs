import Button from '~/components/Button.astro'

Note that the new Real-Time Metrics provides data and metrics starting from **October 15th, 2022**. If you want to view metrics for up to 2 years and before October 15th, 2022, see [Historical Real-Time Metrics](/en/documentation/products/historical-real-time-metrics/).

**Real-Time Metrics** provides you with real-time access to metrics, through charts. Once you've created an edge application or even configured other product and modules, you can view your application's events. Charts exhibit data as soon as your applications begin to have incoming accesses and traffic.

## Accessing

After creating your edge application and/or configuring other products:

1. [Access Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. On the upper-left corner, on the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, select **Real-Time Metrics** on the **OBSERVE** section.

The Real-Time Metrics page opens on the **Edge Applications** tab by default.

## Configuring products and a data interval

To analyze your metrics, you first need to select a product and configure a data interval:

1. Select one of the three available categories on the dropdown menu:
    - **Build**
    - **Secure**
    - **Observe**

2. After selecting a category, select a tab according to the product you want to view:

-  **Build**
    - **Edge Application**
    - **L2 Caching**
    - **Edge Functions**
    - **Image Processor**

- **Secure**
    - **WAF**
    - **Intelligent DNS**

- Observe
    - **Data Streaming**

3. On **Time range**, select a time period from the options to fetch the data that'll be exhibited on the charts:
    - **Last Hour**
    - **Last 24 Hours**
    - **Last 7 Days**
    - **Last 30 Days**
    - **Last 6 Months**
    - Manually set beginning and ending dates

4. If you want to use a different date from the options, click the calendar fields and select a beginning and ending date and time.
5. If you've selected the **Edge Applications** product tab, select between one of the four subtabs:
    - **Data Transferred**
    - **Requests**
    - **Status Codes**
    - **Bandwidth Saving**

After you configure a data interval, all charts from all tabs will be automatically refreshed with the metrics from the chosen time period.

## Viewing charts and metrics

Once you've selected a tab to view charts, you can:

- Add filters.
- Choose a data interval.
- Use the **(?) Get help** tags to learn more about each chart.

To analyse a chart:

1. Navigate through the page to see all available charts.
2. Hover over the points of the charts to view the specific data and time range.
3. Zoom in and out on the chart by scrolling up and down.
4. Use the **Context menu** to copy the chart's query, export the points in a `.CSV` file, enable the chart's mean line, or enable the chart's mean lines per series.
5. Take a look at the **Variation tag** to see how your data is behaving relative to the previous corresponding data interval.
6. Copy the URL path to share the filters you've applied with other RTM users.

If you're looking to complement your analysis with more extensive and detailed information on the metrics you viewed on the charts, you can explore Real-Time Event's logs.
