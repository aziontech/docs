**Real-Time Metrics** provides real-time access to metrics through charts. Charts exhibit data as soon as your applications and other products begin to have incoming accesses and traffic.

:::note
The new Real-Time Metrics provides data and metrics starting from **October 15th, 2022**. If you want to view metrics for up to 2 years and before October 15th, 2022, see [Historical Real-Time Metrics](/en/documentation/products/historical-real-time-metrics/).

## Configuring products and a data interval

Access [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com/) and select **Products menu** > **Real-Time Metrics** on the **OBSERVE** section.

To analyze your metrics, you first need to select a product and configure a data interval:

1. Select one of the three available categories on the dropdown menu:

    <Badge>Build</Badge> <Badge>Secure</Badge> <Badge>Observe</Badge>

2. Select a tab according to the product you want to view:

-  **Build**

    <Badge>Edge Application</Badge> <Badge>Tiered Cache</Badge> <Badge>Edge Functions</Badge> <Badge>Image Processor</Badge>

- **Secure**

    <Badge>WAF</Badge> <Badge>Edge DNS</Badge>

- **Observe**

    <Badge>Data Stream</Badge>

3. On **Time range**, select a time period from the options to fetch the data that'll be exhibited on the charts:

    <Badge>Last Hour</Badge> <Badge>Last 24 Hours</Badge> <Badge>Last 7 Days</Badge> <Badge>Last 30 Days</Badge> <Badge>Last 6 Months</Badge>

4. If you want to use a different date from the options, click the calendar fields and select a beginning and ending date and time.
5. If you've selected the **Edge Applications** product tab, select between one of the four subtabs:

    <Badge>Data Transferred</Badge> <Badge>Requests</Badge> <Badge>Status Codes</Badge> <Badge>Bandwidth Saving</Badge>

All charts from all tabs are automatically refreshed after applying a time range.
