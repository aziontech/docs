:::caution[important]
Azion has two user interfaces: Real-Time Manager and Console, which is in *Preview* stage. Currently, Console is only available for Developer plans and new accounts. Follow the steps according to the user interface you're using.
:::

**Real-Time Metrics** provides real-time access to metrics through charts. Charts exhibit data as soon as your applications and other products begin to have incoming accesses and traffic.

:::note
The new Real-Time Metrics provides data and metrics starting from **October 15th, 2022**. If you want to view metrics for up to 2 years and before October 15th, 2022, see [Historical Real-Time Metrics](/en/documentation/products/observe/historical-real-time-metrics/).

## Configuring products and a data interval

Access [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com) and select **Products menu** > **Real-Time Metrics** on the **OBSERVE** section, or access [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/) and select **Products menu** > **Real-Time Metrics** on the **Observe** section.

To analyze your metrics, you first need to select a product and configure a data interval:

1. Select one of the three available categories on the dropdown menu:

    <Tag severity="info" client:only="vue">Build</Tag> <Tag severity="info" client:only="vue">Secure</Tag> <Tag severity="info" client:only="vue">Observe</Tag>

2. Select a tab according to the product you want to view:

-  **Build**

    <Tag severity="info" client:only="vue">Edge Application</Tag> <Tag severity="info" client:only="vue">Tiered Cache</Tag> <Tag severity="info" client:only="vue">Edge Functions</Tag> <Tag severity="info" client:only="vue">Image Processor</Tag>

- **Secure**

    <Tag severity="info" client:only="vue">WAF</Tag> <Tag severity="info" client:only="vue">Edge DNS</Tag>

- **Observe**

    <Tag severity="info" client:only="vue">Data Stream</Tag>

3. On **Time range**, select a time period from the options to fetch the data that'll be exhibited on the charts:

    <Tag severity="info" client:only="vue">Last Hour</Tag> <Tag severity="info" client:only="vue">Last 24 Hours</Tag> <Tag severity="info" client:only="vue">Last 7 Days</Tag> <Tag severity="info" client:only="vue">Last 30 Days</Tag> <Tag severity="info" client:only="vue">Last 6 Months</Tag>

4. If you want to use a different date from the options, click the calendar fields and select a beginning and ending date and time.
5. If you've selected the **Edge Applications** product tab, select between one of the four subtabs:

    <Tag severity="info" client:only="vue">Data Transferred</Tag> <Tag severity="info" client:only="vue">Requests</Tag> <Tag severity="info" client:only="vue">Status Codes</Tag> <Tag severity="info" client:only="vue">Bandwidth Saving</Tag>

All charts from all tabs are automatically refreshed after applying a time range.
