With Azion Edge Application, you can customize your application's [delivery ports](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/main-settings/) as well as from which ports of your [origin address](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/origins/) your content is retrieved. This dual customization provides complete control over how your content is fetched from origin and delivered to your users for both HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

The choice of delivery ports are limited to those supported by Azion. However, for origins of the **Single Origin** or **Load Balancer** type, you can retrieve your content from the appropriate origin port, as long as the port exists.

## Available port combinations

There are several port combinations you can configure for your application.

| Origin port type | Application port type | Use case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Default | Default | An application served from default origin ports to default delivery ports.</ br>Example: `https://yourorigin.com:443` → `https://yourapplication.com:443`. |
| Modified default | Default | An application served from a default origin port to a different protocol of a default delivery port.</ br>Example: `http://yourorigin.com:80` → `https://yourapplication.com:443`. |
| Default | Custom | An application served from a default origin port (80 in HTTP) to a custom delivery port (8080 in HTTP).</ br>Example: `http://yourorigin.com:80` → `http://yourapplication.com:8080`. | 
| Custom | Default | An application served from a custom origin port to a default delivery port.</ br>Example: `https://yourorigin.com:9443` → `https://yourapplication.com:443`. |
| Custom | Custom | An application served from a custom origin port to a custom delivery port.</ br>Example: `https://yourorigin.com:8443` → `https://yourapplication.com:9443`. |

## Configuring ports

To configure your application's origin and delivery ports:

1. [Access Real-Time Manager (RTM)](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/) > **Edge Application**.
2. Select the edge application you want to configure.
3. Check the solutions for each use case below.

### Default origin port to default application port

If you want your content to be drawn from a default port and served in a default application port, configure your edge application as follows:

1. In the **Origins** tab, select the default origin or add a new origin.
2. Fill in the required fields.
3. Under **Address**, type the hostname of your origin. For example: `yourorigin.com`.
4. Keep the option **Preserve HTTP/HTTPS protocol** enabled.
5. Click the **Save** button.
6. In the **Main Settings** tab of your edge application, select one of the default HTTP or HTTPS ports.
- If you determined your application is delivered via HTTP only, you'll only be able to select port 80. Enabling both HTTP and HTTPS will enable the HTTPS port 443.
8. Click the **Save** button. 

With this option enabled, access to your application through default ports will default to access through the default ports of your origin.

### Modified default origin port to default application port

You can modify the default port your application's origin by enforcing protocols. For example, you can determine that your application will be delivered in HTTPS but the communication with origin servers should be made exclusively in HTTP. To do so, configure your application as follows:

1. In the **Origins** tab, select the default origin or add a new origin.
2. Fill in the required fields.
3. In the section **Origin Protocol Policy**, select **Enforce HTTP** if you want the edge to access your content explicitly through HTTP.
4. Click the **Save** button.
5. In the **Main Settings** tab of your edge application, select one of the default HTTP and HTTPS ports.
6. Click the **Save** button.

### Custom origin port to default application port

You can use the `host:port` notation to specify the port from which your content will be retrieved and deliver it through a default application port. In this case, your content will be retrieved from a custom port of your origin and delivered through the default port you selected. To do so:

1. In the **Origins** tab, select the default origin or add a new origin.
2. Fill in the required fields.
3. Under **Address**, type the hostname of your origin and add the port notation with the custom port. For example: `yourorigin.com:8080`.
4. Keep the option **Preserve HTTP/HTTPS protocol** enabled.
5. Click the **Save** button.
6. In the **Main Settings** tab of your edge application, select one of the default HTTP or HTTPS ports.
7. Click the **Save** button.

### Default origin port to custom application port

To deliver your content from a default origin port to a custom application port:

1. In the **Origins** tab, select the default origin or add a new origin.
2. Fill in the required fields.
3. Under **Address**, type the hostname of your origin. For example: `yourorigin.com`.
4. Keep the option **Preserve HTTP/HTTPS protocol** enabled.
5. Click the **Save** button.
6. In the **Main Settings** tab of your edge application, select one of the custom HTTP or HTTPS ports. For example: `9443`.
7. Click the **Save** button.

### Custom origin port to custom application port

If you want requests to be directed to an origin only using custom ports, you must specify that requests to your application made from the custom port are directed to the correct port. To do so:

1. On the **Main Settings** tab, under **Ports**, check which custom ports have been selected.
2. Go to the **Origins** tab.
3. Click the **Add Origin** button.
4. Give your origin an easy-to-remember name. For example: `Origin:8080`.
5. Fill in the required fields.
6. Under **Address**, use the `host:port` notation. Example: `yourorigin.com:8080`.
7. Keep the option **Preserve HTTP/HTTPS protocol** enabled.
8. Fill in the remaining fields with the desired values.
9. Click the **Save** button.

Now you need to configure your application so that when requests are received in custom ports, they're redirected to the correct origin port:

1. Go to the **Rules Engine** tab.
2. Click the **New Rule** button and select **Request Phase**.
3. Give your rule an easy-to-remember name. Example: `Set Origin :8080`.
4. Under the section **Criteria**, select the variable `${server_port}`.
5. For a comparison operator, select **is equal to**.
6. As an argument, add the desired port. Example: `8080`.
7. In the **Behaviors** section, select the behavior **Set Origin**.
8. Select the origin created in the previous instructions.
9. Click the **Save** button.

If more than one custom port was selected for the application, you may create additional rules, repeating the previous steps for each custom port selected.

From this moment on, when a request is made to the edge application using a custom port, the edge points the request to the assigned port when accessing the origin.
