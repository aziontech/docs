**Error Responses** for Azion **Edge Application** allows you to customize and define the cache TTL of error pages that are delivered when a request returns a 4xx or 5xx HTTP status.

<Button href="/en/documentation/products/edge-application/error-responses/" text="Learn more about Error Responses"></Button>

To customize an error response page, follow the steps:

1. Access [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. On the upper-left corner, select the three horizontal lines to open the **Products menu** > **Edge Application**.
3. Select the application linked to the domain that needs the new error page.
4. Select the **Error Responses** tab.
5. The first **Status Code** field is disabled, but under **Error Caching TTL (seconds)** you can set the cache *time-to-live* (TTL), in seconds, of all error pages.
    > This first status code serves as a placeholder to cache the page in case an unexpected status is received.
6. To customize specific error codes, click the **+** button.
7. In the new **Status Code** field, select the status code you want to customize.
8. Change the cache TTL in the **Error Caching TTL (seconds)** field.
   - You can keep the same cache TTL set in the previous field or add a different TTL.
9. In the **URI** field, you can add a *path* to an error page created in the source.
10. In the **Custom Status Code** field, you can customize the HTTP status that will be received by the user.
11. In the **Origin** section, you can define the origin of error page URIs.
    - You can configure their origins in the application's **Origins** tab.
12. Click the **Save** button.

Done. Your edge application will now display an error page with the new configuration.
