To delete an existing edge application via traditional Domains interface:

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Edge Application**.
    - You'll be redirected to the **Edge Application** page, which lists all the edge applications you've created. 
    - The list is organized alphabetically. You can also use the **Search** bar located on the upper-left corner of the list; currently, it filters only by **Name**.
2. Find the edge application you want to delete.
3. Click the three horizontal points in the right-corner.
4. Select the **Delete** option.
5. Type "delete" in the popover to confirm you want to delete that specific edge application.
