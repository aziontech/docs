After you build an application on Azion, it's possible to edit and manage its settings anytime you want, including deleting the application.

To delete an existing application, follow these steps: 

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Applications**.
    - You'll be redirected to the **Applications** page, which lists all the applications you've created. 
    - The list is organized alphabetically. You can also use the **Search** bar located on the upper-left corner of the list; currently, it filters only by **Name**.
2. Find the application you want to delete.
3. Click the three horizontal points in the right-corner.
4. Select the **Delete** option.
5. Type "delete" in the popover to confirm you want to delete that specific application.
6. Click the **Delete** button.

Done. A success message will appear on the top of the page confirming that your application has been deleted. The application will no longer be available on your list.
