After you build an edge application on Azion, it's possible to edit and manage its settings anytime you want, including deleting the edge application.

To delete an existing edge application, follow these steps: 

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Edge Application**.
    - You'll be redirected to the **Edge Application** page, which lists all the edge applications you've created. 
    - The list is organized alphabetically. You can also use the **Search** bar located on the upper-left corner of the list; currently, it filters only by **Name**.
2. Find the edge application you want to delete.
3. Click the three horizontal points in the right-corner.
4. Select the **Delete** option.
5. Type "delete" in the popover to confirm you want to delete that specific edge application.
6. Click the **Delete** button.

Done. A success message will appear on the top of the page confirming that your edge application has been deleted. The application will no longer be available on your list.
