Azion **Edge Application** can keep your content cached at the edge to support high-levels of demand without compromising quality or performance, resulting in a better user experience, faster load times, and lower maintenance costs.

You can optimize processing times by defining the time-to-live (TTL) for cached content at the origin and at the browser, bypass origin cache settings, and forward cookies with [Rules Engine](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/rules-engine/).

> To configure cache settings for dynamic content, see the guide on [How to configure Advanced Cache Key for Edge Application](/en/documentation/products/guides/apis-performance-sites-application-acceleration/).

## Creating and applying a cache setting for Edge Application 

In order to customize cache policies, you must first enable the **Application Acceleration** module to extend the capabilities of **Rules Engine**. This will also allow you to change the cache TTL to values under 60 seconds.

To enable Application Acceleration, follow the steps:

1. Access [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com).
2. On the top-left corner of the page, go to **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines.
3. Under the **BUILD** section, select **Edge Application**.
4. Select the application you want to configure or [create a new one](/en/documentation/products/getting-started/).
5. On the **Main settings** tab, under the **Modules** section, activate the **Application Acceleration** switch.
6. Click the **Save** button.

Now it's time to create a cache setting and customize cache policies. This is the point where you define how long you want your static content to remain in cache.

To create a new cache setting, follow the steps:

1. Navigate to the **Cache Settings** tab of your application.
2. Click the **Add Cache Settings** button.
3. Enter an easy to remember name for your cache setting. For example: `/target-uri - Cache TTL`.
4. In the **Expiration Settings**, you can customize your cache's TTL as follows:
   - Under **Browser Cache Settings**, select **Override Cache Settings** to define how long your content can be cached in browsers.
   - Under **CDN Cache Settings**, select **Override Cache Settings** to define how long your content can be cached at the edge.
5. If you've chosen to override cache settings, add the desired **Maximum TTL** in seconds.
   - At this point, you may also customize other cache settings for dynamic content provided by the [Advanced Cache Key](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/cache-settings/#advanced-cache-key) feature.
6. Click the **Save** button.

Next, you must create a rule to apply the cache settings you've created. To do so, follow the steps:

1. Navigate to the **Rules Engine** tab of your edge application.
2. Click the **New Rule** button and select **Request Phase**.
3. Enter an easy to remember name for your rule.
4. In the **Criteria** section, set the desired criteria that will trigger the rule. To apply the cache settings to a specific URI:

    > If `${uri}` *starts with* `/target-uri`

5. In the **Behavior** section, select the **Set Cache Policy** behavior.
6. In the argument field, select the `/target-uri - Cache TTL` cache setting.
7. Click the **Save** button.

Done. The cache settings you created will now be applied to the condition defined in the criteria. You can customize the rule further to suit the business needs of your application.

## Creating a rule to bypass cache from the origin

If you want to bypass origin cache policies, you can create a rule as follows:

1. With the **Application Acceleration** module active, navigate to the **Rules Engine** tab of your edge application.
2. Click the **New Rule** button and select **Request Phase**.
3. Enter an easy to remember name for your rule. For example: `/target-uri - Bypass Cache`.
4. In the **Criteria** section, set the desired criteria that will trigger the rule. To bypass cache from a specific URI:

    > If `${uri}` *starts with* `/target-uri`

5. In the **Behavior** section, select the **Bypass Cache** behavior.
6. Click the **Save** button.

Bypass Cache only affects origin cache policies, not browser cache policies. You can customize browser cache through the **Set Cache Policy** behavior described above.

## Creating a rule to forward cookies from the origin to the user

If you want to forward the contents of the `Set-Cookie` header to your user, you can create a rule as follows:

1. Navigate to the **Rules Engine** tab of your edge application.
2. Click the **New Rule** button and select **Response Phase**.
3. Enter an easy to remember name for your rule. For example: `/target-uri - Forward Cookies`.
4. In the **Criteria** section, set the desired criteria that will trigger the rule. To forward cookies from a specific URI:

    > If `${uri}` *starts with* `/target-uri`

5. In the **Behavior** section, select the **Forward Cookies** behavior.
6. Click the **Save** button.

> To forward cookies from the user to the origin, you can create the same rule in the **Request phase**.

Note that session cookies may be included in the **Forward Cookies** behavior. To prevent users from receiving cookies from private sessions:

1. Navigate to the **Cache Settings** tab.
2. Create a new setting by clicking **Add Cache Settings**.
3. Enter an easy to remember name for your cache setting. For example: `/target-uri - Private cookies`.
4. Under the **Advanced Cache Key** section, on **Cache by Cookie**, select the option **Content varies by cookies, except for a few**.
5. List all session cookies you wish to keep private.
6. Click the **Save** button.

Finally, to activate the cache setting with the listed private cookies for the `/target-uri` page:

1. Go to the **Rules Engine** tab.
2. Select the `/target-uri - Forward Cookies` rule you created in the previous steps.
3. In the **Behavior** section, click the **+ Behavior** button.
4. Select the **Set Cache Policy** behavior.
5. In the argument field, select the `/target-uri - Private cookies` cache policy.
6. Click the **Save** button.

You can also combine this feature with the **Bypass cache** behavior described in the previous section.
