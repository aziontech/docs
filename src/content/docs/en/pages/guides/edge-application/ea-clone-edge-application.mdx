After you build an application on Azion, it's possible to edit and manage its settings anytime you want, including cloning the application. In this case, the new application will have identical settings as the original.

To clone an existing application, follow these steps: 

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Applications**.
    - You'll be redirected to the **Applications** page, which lists all the applications you've created. 
    - The list is organized alphabetically. You can also use the **Search** bar located on the upper-left corner of the list.
2. Find the application you want to clone.
3. Click the three horizontal dots in the right-corner.
4. Select the **Clone** option.
5. Type a unique name for your new application in the popover.
    - Type a unique and easy to remember name.
    - The platform returns an error message if the name is already in use. If that happens, try again with a different name.
6. Click the **Clone** button.
7. You'll be redirected to the **Edit Application** page. Click the **Save** button to save your application.

Done. A success message will appear on the top of the page confirming your application has been cloned.

The cloned application will be visible on the list and it'll have the same settings as the original one.
