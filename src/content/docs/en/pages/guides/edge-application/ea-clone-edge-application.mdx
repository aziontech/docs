After you build an edge application on Azion, it's possible to edit and manage its settings anytime you want, including cloning the edge application. In this case, the new edge application will have identical settings as the original.

To clone an existing edge application, follow these steps: 

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Edge Application**.
    - You'll be redirected to the **Edge Application** page, which lists all the edge applications you've created. 
    - The list is organized alphabetically. You can also use the **Search** bar located on the upper-left corner of the list.
2. Find the edge application you want to clone.
3. Click the three horizontal dots in the right-corner.
4. Select the **Clone** option.
5. Type a unique name for your new Edge Aplication in the popover.
- Type a unique and easy to remember name.
- The platform returns an error message if the name is already in use. If that happens, try again with a different name.
6. Click the **Clone** button.
7. You'll be redirected to the edit Edge Application page. Click the **Save** button to save your Edge Applications.

Done. A success message will appear on the top of the page confirming your edge application has been cloned.

The cloned edge application will be visible on the list and it'll have the same settings as the original one.
