You can debug requests to edge applications by creating headers that return cache indicators using the [ModHeader](https://modheader.com/) extension for Google Chrome. These headers will return different cache indicators such as page or object cache time and time left for the next expiration.

To verify indicators, follow the steps:

1. Install the [ModHeader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/modheader-modify-http-hea/idgpnmonknjnojddfkpgkljpfnnfcklj) extension by clicking the **Add to Chrome** button.
2. Click the **Extensions button** on your Google Chrome and select the **Modheader** extension; the **Profile** page will appear.
3. Select the **Request headers** item and fill in the fields according to the following information:
   - **Name**: Pragma
   - **Value**: azion-debug-cache
4. Click the **Pause Modheader** icon.
5. Restart the extension by clicking the **Resume Modheader** icon.

Next, follow these steps to enable **Developer Tools** on Google Chrome to access the information:

1. Open **Google Chrome**.
2. Click the **Customize and Control Google Chrome** button, represented by the ï¸™ icon on the toolbar.
3. Select **More Tools** > **Developer Tools**.
4. Select the **Network** tab.
5. Access the page in which the information is being cached.
6. Select the **cached content** among the requests.
7. Select the **Headers** tab.

The cache indicators will appear according to the following headers:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| X-Cache | Status of the request, which is either HIT, MISS, EXPIRED, UPDATING or STALE. |
| X-Cache-Key | Cache key of the object. Normally consists of the combination of host + URI + arguments. |
| X-Cache-File | Cache file of the object, consisting of the md5 of the cache key. |
| X-Cache-Since | Unix Time Stamp* of when the object enters the cache. |
| X-Cache-Expire | Unix Time Stamp* of when the object leaves the cache. |
| X-Cache-Expire-In | Time that the object will remain in cache, in seconds. |
| X-Cache-Valid | Time set for the object to be in the cache. This time can be set unconditionally on the webserver or can come from the origin via Cache-Control headers. |
| X-Cache-Config | ID of the configuration of the virtual host on the webserver. This value is generated by the RTM. |
| X-Cache-ID | Unique request ID. |

*\* You can convert Unix Time Stamp into the standard format using the [Unix Time Stamp website](http://www.unixtimestamp.com/).*
