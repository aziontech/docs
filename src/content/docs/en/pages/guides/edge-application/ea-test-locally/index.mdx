Before you [point your domain to Azion](/en/documentation/products/guides/point-domain-to-azion/), you can run your edge application locally in your device. This way, you'll have a chance to test any changes and correct bugs before you publish your application using your custom domain.

## Requirements

- A working internet connection.
- Administrator/sudo privileges in your device.
- A command line tool, such as [PowerShell]() or [Terminal]().
- (Windows) A text-editing tool such as [Notepad]().

## Step 1. Finding out your edge node IP

To stage an application on the edge locally, you'll have to redirect your device's DNS resolution to an edge node.

First, you need to find the IPs of the edge node where your application is being served. The IP list will change based on the node closest to your location.

There are several ways to find your edge node IP, but the most common one is to use the `host` command paired with your **Azion domain**.

The following command can be run on any Unix-based or Windows operating systems:

```bash
host xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net
```

You will receive a response similar to this, containing the Azion domain and the IP address of the edge node:

```bash
xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net has address 200.0.0.0
```

## Step 2. Associating edge node IP to domain

Now you must associate the edge node IP to one or more CNAMEs that you have specified for your domain in your local host configuration.

Every computer device has a `etc/hosts` file that maps IP addresses to domains. When you associate the edge node IP to the CNAME you assigned to your domain in your hosts file, you are forcing your computer's DNS resolution to access that domain through the edge node and not through public DNS. This allows you to stage your application locally as if it was already deployed to your custom domain.

:::
If you did not list any CNAMEs for your domain, you must first [configure your domain](link_configure-domain) and add one or more CNAMEs.

### Windows

1. Launch **Notepad** or any other text editing tool.
2. In the path field on top, access the `hosts` file path, which should be `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\`.
  - Note that the hosts file is located in whichever drive Windows was installed and thus may not be the C: drive.
3. Select the `hosts` file.
4. Click **Open**.
5. Add a new line under the `localhost` line.
6. Paste the IP of the edge node into the first column.
7. Add the CNAME you configured for the Azion domain to the second column.

  ```bash
  200.0.0.0    yourdomain.com
  200.0.0.0    yourdomain.org
  ```

8. Click on **File** > **Save**.

### Linux

1. Launch the terminal.
   - In most Linux systems, the terminal is located uder **Applications** > **Utilities** > **Terminal**.
2. Type the following command to launch the `vim` text editor:

  ```bash
  sudo vim /etc/hosts
  ```

3. Confirm your identity by typing your system password and press **Enter**.
4. Use the arrow keys to navigate through the file.
5. Add a new line under localhost.
6. Paste the edge node ID into the first column.
7. Add the CNAME you configured for the Azion domain in the second column.

  ```bash
  200.0.0.0  yourdomain.com
  200.0.0.0  yourdomain.org
  ```

8. Press **Esc** to switch to command mode.
7. Type `:x` and press enter to save and exit the `vim` terminal editor.

### Mac

1. Use the **Launchpad** to search for the **Terminal** app.
2. Open the terminal and type the following command to launch the `nano` text editor:

```bash
sudo nano /private/etc/hosts
```

3. Confirm your identity by typing your system password and press **Enter**.
4. Use the arrow keys to navigate through the file.
5. Add a new line under localhost.
6. Paste the edge node ID into the first column.
7. Add the CNAME you configured for the Azion domain in the second column.

For example:

```bash
200.0.0.0   yourdomain.com
200.0.0.0   yourdomain.org
```

8. Press **Ctrl+O** to save your changes.
9. Press **Ctrl+X** to exit the `nano` text editor.

:::note
If you wish, you may add comments to your etc/hosts file to track your changes. You can add a comment using the `#<your comment here>` notation. Every character in line to the right of the pound symbol (#) will not be processed by the `hosts` file.
:::

## Step 3. Launching your application locally

Once your `hosts` file is configured, you'll be able to access your application through the address you provided using any browser.

:::important
Most browsers keep DNS resolution in cache. That means that if you have previously accessed your application using the CNAME you configured in the domain, your browser may serve your application using the IP from cache and not from the edge node.
:::

To avoid your browser from resolving your host name through cache, launch your browser using incognito mode, use a different browser, or clear browser cache before accessing the domain.

To access your staged application through a browser, in the search bar, navigate to the same CNAME you configured in your domain and in the `hosts` file.

You should now see your Azion domain as if it was in production and perform any necessary tests before pointing your public DNS resolution to Azion.
