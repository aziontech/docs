Before you [point your domain to Azion](/en/documentation/products/guides/point-domain-to-azion/), you can stage running your application on the edge by changing the name resolution of your `hosts` file. This way, you'll have a chance to stage any changes and correct bugs before you publish your application using your custom domain.

:::note
This guide describes how you can test your application's hostname on the edge before pointing your domain to Azion. To run an application in localhost, use the [Azion CLI](/en/documentation/products/azion-cli/overview/).

## Requirements

You'll need:

- An edge application and a [configured domain](/en/documentation/products/guides/configure-a-domain/).
- A working internet connection.
- `sudo` privileges in your device.
- A command line tool, such as Windows PowerShell or Mac Terminal.
- For Windows, a text-editing tool such as Notepad.

## Step 1. Finding your edge node IP

To stage an application on the edge through the `hosts` file, you must redirect your device's DNS resolution to an edge node. 

First, you need to find the IPs of the edge node where your application is being served. The node IP will change based on the edge node associated with your current location.

There are several ways to find your edge node IP, but the most common one is to use the `host` command paired with your Azion domain.

The following command can be run on any Unix-based or Windows operating systems:

```bash
host xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net
```

You'll receive a response containing the Azion domain and one or more IP addresses of the edge node:

```bash
xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net has address 200.0.0.0
```

---

## Step 2. Associating the edge node IP to a domain

Now you must associate the edge node IP to one or more CNAMEs that you've specified for your domain in your host configuration.

:::caution[warning]
For the association to take place, you must first [configure your domain](/en/documentation/products/guides/configure-a-domain/) and add at least one custom domain CNAME to the domain's CNAME list.
:::

### Windows

1. Launch **Notepad** or any other text editing tool.
2. Open the `hosts` file, which should be located in `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\`.
  - Note that the `hosts` file is located in whichever drive Windows was installed and thus may not be the C: drive.
3. Add a new line under the `localhost` line.
4. Paste the edge node IP into the first column.
5. Add the CNAME you configured for the Azion domain to the second column. For example:

  ```bash
  200.0.0.0    yourdomain.com
  200.0.0.0    yourdomain.org
  ```

6. Click on **File** > **Save**.

### Linux

1. Launch the terminal.
   - In most Linux distributions, the terminal is located uder **Applications** > **Utilities** > **Terminal**.
2. Type the following command to launch the `vim` text editor:

  ```bash
  sudo vim /etc/hosts
  ```

3. Confirm your identity by typing your system password and press **Enter**.
4. Use the arrow keys to navigate through the file.
5. Add a new line under `localhost`.
6. Paste the edge node IP into the first column.
7. Add the CNAME you configured for the Azion domain in the second column.

  ```bash
  200.0.0.0  yourdomain.com
  200.0.0.0  yourdomain.org
  ```

8. Press **Esc** to switch to command mode.
7. Type `:x` and press enter to save and exit the `vim` terminal editor.

### macOS

1. Use the **Launchpad** to search for the **Terminal** app.
2. Open the terminal and type the following command to launch the `nano` text editor:

```bash
sudo nano /private/etc/hosts
```

3. Confirm your identity by typing your system password and press **Enter**.
4. Use the arrow keys to navigate through the file.
5. Add a new line under `localhost`.
6. Paste the edge node IP into the first column.
7. Add the CNAME you configured for the Azion domain in the second column.

For example:

```bash
200.0.0.0   yourdomain.com
200.0.0.0   yourdomain.org
```

8. Press **Ctrl+O** to save your changes.
9. Press **Ctrl+X** to exit the `nano` text editor.

:::tip
You may add comments to your `etc/hosts` file to track your changes. You can add a comment using the `#<your comment here>` notation. Every character in line to the right of the pound symbol (#) won't be processed by the `hosts` file.
:::

---

## Step 3. Staging your application

Once your `hosts` file is configured, you'll be able to access your application through the CNAMEs you provided using any browser in your device.

:::caution[warning]
Most browsers keep DNS resolution in cache. That means that if you've previously accessed your application using the CNAME you configured in the domain, your browser may serve your application using the IP from cache from the public DNS and not from the edge node.
:::

To avoid your browser from resolving your host name through cache, launch your browser using incognito mode, use a different browser, or clear browser cache before accessing the domain.

In the absence of cache, if your original application is already served on the CNAME you assigned but hasn't undergone [domain record modifications](/en/documentation/products/guides/point-domain-to-azion/#step-2-modify-domain-records) in the DNS provider, the `hosts` file will serve the edge application using the custom host.

To access your staged application through a browser, in the search bar, navigate to the same CNAME you configured in your domain and in the `hosts` file.

You should now see your Azion domain as if it was in production and perform any necessary tests before [pointing your DNS resolution from your provider](/en/documentation/products/guides/point-domain-to-azion/) or [migrating your authoritative nameservers](/en/documentation/products/guides/migrate-ns-to-azion/) to Azion.
