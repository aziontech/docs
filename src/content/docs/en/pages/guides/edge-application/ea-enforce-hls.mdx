Azion Edge Platform allows you to deliver live streaming content in **HLS format**, being able to easily self-provision and configure your cache policies. This guide covers the step-by-step to enforcing HLS cache, managing chunks and playlists caching, and setting up rules engines rules.

## Requirements

- An Azion edge application, or [creating a new one](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/build-an-application/).
- [A domain associated with the edge application](/en/documentation/products/guides/configure-a-domain/).
- [Tiered Cache enabled](/en/documentation/products/guides/billing-and-subscriptions/) in your account.

## Enforcing cache policies for HLS

To enforce cache policies for HLS in the edge application, follow the steps as explained next.

### Creating a cache policy for the chunks

First, you must to create a cache policy for the chunks:

1. Access [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com/).
2. Go to **Products menu** > **Edge Application**.
3. Select your application.
4. Open the **Cache Settings** tab and click the **+ Cache Setting** button to create the new cache policy:
- For **Browser Cache Settings**, select **Override Cache Setting** and define a **Maximum TTL** of `0`.
- For **Edge Cache Settings**, select **Override Cache Setting** and define a **Maximum TTL** of `60`.
- Enable the **Tiered Cache** switch.
- In the **Advanced Cache Key** section, define the behavior of your application toward cache segmentation of objects.
    - The recommendation is selecting **Content does not vary**, for **Query String** and/or **Cookies**, according to your needs.
5. Click the **Save** button.
    
### Creating cache policies for the playlist

Still on the **Cache Settings** tab, click the **+ Cache Setting** button again to create a new cache policy for the playlist:

- For **Browser Cache Settings**, select **Override Cache Setting** and define a **Maximum TTL** of `0`.
- For **Edge Cache Settings**, select **Override Cache Setting** and define a **Maximum TTL** of `5`.
- Enable the **Tiered Cache** switch.
- In the **Advanced Cache Key** section, define the behavior of your application toward cache segmentation of objects.
    - The recommendation is selecting **Content does not vary**, for **Query String** and/or **Cookies**, according to your needs.

Then, click the **Save** button.

### Creating Rules Engine rules

 - Still on the application page, open the **Rules Engine** tab:

First, create a rule for the chunks: 
1. Click the **+ Rule** button.
2. Give a name and a description (optional) to your rule.
3. Select the **Request Phase** option.
4. In **Criteria**, define `if ${uri}` *matches* `.\*.ts`.
5. In **Behaviors**, select **Set Cache Policy** and add the policy for the chunks you created in the previous step.
6. Click the **Save** button.

Now, create a rule for the playlist: 
1. Click the **+ Rule** button.
2. Give a name and a description (optional) to your rule.
3. Select the **Request Phase** option.
4. In **Criteria**, define `if ${uri}` *matches* `\*.m3u8`.
5. In **Behaviors**, select **Set Cache Policy** and add the policy for the playlist you created in the previous step.
6. Click the **Save** button.


Done! Now you can configure your source and encoder pointing to Azion and stream your content, enforcing HLS cache.
