Web applications that use the HTTPS protocol require a [Digital Certificate](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/digital-certificates/). When you redirect your traffic to Azion, you have the option to generate a *Let's Encrypt*™ certificate, which is a free and secure way to encrypt data for your edge application. Azion automates the issuance, renewal, and deactivation of this TLS certificate through an internal certificate management solution.

---

## Before you begin

Azion generates Let's Encrypt certificates for domains and subdomains registered in the Domain Name System (DNS). Domains can be acquired and registered into DNS zones through a third-party DNS provider, such as [GoDaddy](http://www.godaddy.com/) or [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/get-a-domain/).

For the purposes of this guide, assume that the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) that you want to generate a Let's Encrypt certificate for is a CNAME record `www.yourdomain.org` under a `yourdomain.org` DNS zone.

## Generating a Let's Encrypt certificate

You may choose to generate a Let’s Encrypt certificate for domain records hosted in [Edge DNS](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-dns/) or in the external DNS provider of your top-level domain.

To that end, you'll have to prepare your DNS server and register records for Azion to be able to create and manage your Let's Encrypt certificate.

### Option 1: Preparing DNS entry on Azion Edge DNS

Azion allows you to host DNS zones by redirecting the DNS resolution of a domain to **Edge DNS**. When using Edge DNS, all configurations needed are made through **Azion Console**.

To create a DNS zone for a domain entry `www.yourdomain.org` in **Edge DNS**:

1. Access [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com).
2. On the upper-left corner of the page, click the three horizontal lines to open the **Products menu**.
3. Under the section **SECURE**, select **Edge DNS**.
4. If you don't have an active zone, click the **Add Zone** button.
5. Give your zone an easy-to-remember name.
6. Indicate the FQDN as recorded in the DNS. Example: `yourdomain.org`.
7. Click the **Save** button.

> For more information on how to redirect your domain's authoritative DNS servers, see the [Edge DNS](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-dns/) documentation.

Once your DNS resolution has been successfully redirected and is hosted in Edge DNS, you can create a new *CNAME record* for the domain by following the steps:

1. In the **Edge DNS** page in [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com), select the desired zone.
2. Navigate to the **Records** tab.
3. Under **Name**, create a hostname or subdomain. Example: `www`.
4. Under **Type**, select **CNAME - Canonical name**.
5. Under **Value**, enter the Azion-provided domain address in FQDN format. Example: `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`
   - If you don't have a domain, skip to section [Creating a domain](#creating-a-domain) for more information.
6. Set the **TTL** and **Policy** as desired.
7. Click the **Save** button.

If the **CNAME** entry listed in your Azion domain has been created in your **Edge DNS** zone, Azion will automatically verify the domain authenticity and the Let's Encrypt certificate will become active. Go to the section [Checking the status of Let's Encrypt certificates](#checking-the-status-of-lets-encrypt-certificates) for more information on certificate statuses.

### Option 2: Preparing DNS entry with an external DNS provider

If you have a domain registered in an external DNS zone, Azion will verify the domain authenticity in an external DNS provider by completing Let's Encrypt method called [DNS-01 ACME client challenge](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#dns-01-challenge) to issue the certificate.

:::note
If you already have a zone in **Edge DNS**, the DNS-01 challenge will be completed automatically.
:::

To allow the DNS-01 challenge to occur:

1. Access your DNS provider's website.
2. Navigate to the DNS management area.
3. Create a **CNAME record** for each domain you want to use the certificate. This must be the same CNAME you'll add to the **CNAME** field when creating your Azion domain later. Example: `www.yourdomain.org`
4. Add a new record to your domain as follows:

| Name | Value | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `_acme-challenge.<your domain>` <br /><br />For example:<br /> `_acme-challenge.www.yourdomain.org` | `<your domain>.letsencrypt.azion.com` <br /><br />Example:<br /> `www.yourdomain.org.letsencrypt.azion.com` | CNAME |

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for every CNAME you intend to add to your **Domain**.
6. Save your settings.

Now that the challenge can take place, the next step is to create a domain with Azion.

## Creating a domain

To create an Azion **Domain**, you must have an edge application. If you haven't created an edge application yet, follow the [Getting started](/en/documentation/products/getting-started/) guide.

Once you have an edge application, you need to [create a domain](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/domains/) and list the CNAMEs that you want to secure with the Let's Encrypt certificate. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Access [Azion Console]](https://console.azion.com).
2. On the upper-left corner, select the three horizontal lines to open the **Products menu** > **Domains**.
3. Click the **Add Domain** button.
4. Name your domain. Example: `Domain`.
5. Under **Edge Certificate**, select the option **Let's Encrypt**.
6. Under **CNAME**, add the FQDN of the domain you created in the previous sections. Example: `www.yourdomain.org`
7. Under **Edge Application**, select the application you created.
8. Click the **Save** button.

## Checking the status of Let's Encrypt certificates

You can check the status of your Let's Encrypt TLS certificate by following these steps:

1. In [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com), access the **Products menu**.
2. Under **EDGE LIBRARIES**, select **Digital Certificates**.
3. In your digital certificate list, you'll see a new entry in the format `Domain - Let's Encrypt <timestamp>`.

The status on the right of the list shows you whether the certificate has been issued. An **Active** certificate has been verified and issued successfully. A **Pending** status means the certificate is still undergoing checks in Azion's internal certificate manager.

:::note
If the **Pending** status remains for over 48 hours, you must check if the CNAME records you listed in the section [Creating a domain](#creating-a-domain) are correct.
:::

---

## Managing a Let's Encrypt certificate

Once the certificate undergoes DNS validation, it won't require manual renewal upon expiration, which occurs after *90 days*. Deactivation will occur if the certificate is deleted or if the associated domain is deleted from Azion.

:::tip
To ensure that the certificate is renewed for domains hosted in external services, **don't delete the DNS challenge entry** you've created in the section [Option 2: Preparing DNS entry with an external DNS provider](#option-2-preparing-dns-entry-with-an-external-dns-provider).
:::

## Pointing your traffic to Azion

Once you have an active Let's Encrypt certificate, you can point your traffic to Azion by associating your Azion-provided domain address `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net` to your domain's CNAME record. To do so:

1. Access [Azion Console](https://console.azion.com).
2. On the upper-left corner of the page, go to **Products menu** > **Domains**.
3. From the **Domains** list, copy the Azion-provided domain address that you want to associate to the external domain, which should be in the format `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`
4. In another browser tab, access your DNS provider.
5. Navigate to the DNS management area.
6. Edit the domain CNAME record with the Let's Encrypt certificate as follows:

| Name | Value | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `www.yourdomain.org` | `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net` | CNAME |

7. Save your settings.

Note that there might be a delay in propagation time when you access your application. If that's the case, you can [run the DIG command](/en/documentation/products/guides/run-the-dig-command/) in your terminal to check whether your domain points to the Azion address.
