Web applications that use the HTTPS protocol require a [Digital Certificate](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/digital-certificates/). When you redirect your traffic to Azion, you have the option to generate a *Let's Encrypt*â„¢ certificate, which is a free and secure way to encrypt data for your edge application. Azion automates the issuance, renewal, and deactivation of this TLS certificate through an internal certificate management solution.

## Before you begin

Azion generates Let's Encrypt certificates for domains and subdomains registered in the Domain Name System (DNS). Domains can be acquired and registered into DNS zones through a third-party DNS provider, such as [GoDaddy](http://www.godaddy.com/) or [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/get-a-domain/).

For the purposes of this guide, assume that the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) that you want to generate a Let's Encrypt certificate for is a CNAME record `www.yourdomain.org` under a `yourdomain.org` DNS zone.

:::note
Azion support for Let's Encrypt certificates is entirely subject to the availability and limitations defined by the Let's Encrypt service, as outlined in its [official documentation](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/).
:::

## Generating a Let's Encrypt certificate

You may choose to generate a Let's Encrypt certificate for domain records hosted in [Edge DNS](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-dns/) or in the external DNS provider of your top-level domain.

To that end, you'll have to prepare your DNS server and register records for Azion to be able to create and manage your Let's Encrypt certificate.

:::note
There is also the possibility to [create a Let's Encrypt certificate via Azion CLI](/en/documentation/devtools/cli/create/#digital-certificate-id).
::: 

### Option 1: Preparing DNS entry on Azion Edge DNS

Azion allows you to host DNS zones by redirecting the DNS resolution of a domain to **Edge DNS**. When using Edge DNS, all configurations needed are made through Azion interface.

To create a DNS zone for a domain entry `www.yourdomain.org` in **Edge DNS**:

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Edge DNS**.
2. If you don't have an active zone, click the **+ Zone** button.
3. Give your zone an easy-to-remember name.
4. Indicate the FQDN as recorded in the DNS. Example: `yourdomain.org`.
5. Click the **Save** button.

:::tip
For more information on how to redirect your domain's authoritative DNS servers, check the [Edge DNS](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-dns/) documentation.
:::

Once your DNS resolution has been successfully redirected and is hosted in Edge DNS, you can create a new *CNAME record* for the domain by following the steps:

1. Still on the **Edge DNS** page, select the desired zone.
2. Navigate to the **Records** tab.
3. Click the **+ Record** button.
4. Under **Name**, create a hostname or subdomain.
5. Under **Record Type**, select **CNAME - Canonical name**.
6. Under **Value**, enter the Azion-provided domain address in FQDN format. Example: `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`
   - If you don't have a domain, skip to section [Creating a domain](#creating-a-domain) for more information.
7. Set the **TTL** and **Policy** as desired.
8. Click the **Save** button.

If the **CNAME** entry listed in your Azion domain has been created in your **Edge DNS** zone, Azion will automatically verify the domain authenticity and the Let's Encrypt certificate will become active. Go to the section [Checking the status of Let's Encrypt certificates](#checking-the-status-of-lets-encrypt-certificates) for more information on certificate statuses.

### Option 2: Preparing DNS entry with an external DNS provider

If you have a domain registered in an external DNS zone, Azion will verify the domain authenticity in an external DNS provider by completing Let's Encrypt method called [DNS-01 ACME client challenge](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#dns-01-challenge) to issue the certificate.

:::note
If you already have a zone in **Edge DNS**, the DNS-01 challenge will be completed automatically.
:::

To allow the DNS-01 challenge to occur:

1. Access your DNS provider's website.
2. Navigate to the DNS management area.
3. Create a **CNAME record** for each domain that you want to use with the certificate. Make sure this **CNAME record** matches the value you'll enter in the **CNAME** field when you create your Azion domain. For example:`www.yourdomain.org`.
4. Add a new record to your domain as follows:

| Name | Value | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `_acme-challenge.<your domain>` <br /><br />For example:<br /> `_acme-challenge.www.yourdomain.org` | `<your domain>.letsencrypt.azion.com` <br /><br />Example:<br /> `www.yourdomain.org.letsencrypt.azion.com` | CNAME |

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for every CNAME you intend to add to your **Domain**.
6. Save your settings.

Now that the challenge can take place, the next step is to create a domain with Azion.

## Checking the status of Let's Encrypt certificates

You can check the status of your Let's Encrypt TLS certificate by following these steps:


1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Digital Certificates**.
2. In your digital certificate list, you'll see a new entry in the format `Domain - Let's Encrypt <timestamp>`.


The status on the right of the list shows you whether the certificate has been issued. An **Active** certificate has been verified and issued successfully. A **Pending** status means the certificate is still undergoing checks in Azion's internal certificate manager.

:::note
If the **Pending** status remains for over 48 hours, you must check if the CNAME records you listed in the section [Creating a domain](#creating-a-domain) are correct.
:::

---

## Managing a Let's Encrypt certificate

Once the certificate undergoes DNS validation, it won't require manual renewal upon expiration, which occurs after *90 days*. Deactivation will occur if the certificate is deleted or if the associated domain is deleted from Azion.

:::tip
To ensure that the certificate is renewed for domains hosted in external services, **don't delete the DNS challenge entry** you've created in the section [Option 2: Preparing DNS entry with an external DNS provider](#option-2-preparing-dns-entry-with-an-external-dns-provider).
:::

---

## Pointing your traffic to Azion

Once you have an active Let's Encrypt certificate, you can point your traffic to Azion by associating your Azion-provided domain address `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net` to your domain's CNAME record. To do so:

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Domains**.
2. From the **Domains** list, copy the Azion-provided domain address that you want to associate to the external domain, which should be in the format `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`
3. In another browser tab, access your DNS provider.
4. Navigate to the DNS management area.
5. Edit the domain CNAME record with the Let's Encrypt certificate as follows:

| Name | Value | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `www.yourdomain.org` | `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net` | CNAME |

6. Save your settings.

Note that there might be a delay in propagation time when you access your application. If that's the case, you can [run the DIG command](/en/documentation/products/guides/run-the-dig-command/) in your terminal to check whether your domain points to the Azion address.
