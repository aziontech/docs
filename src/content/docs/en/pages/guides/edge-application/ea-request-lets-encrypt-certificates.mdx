Web applications that use the HTTPS protocol require a [Digital Certificate](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/digital-certificates/). When you redirect your traffic to Azion, you have the option to generate a *Let's Encrypt*â„¢ certificate, which is a free and secure way to encrypt data for your edge application. Azion automates the issuance, renewal, and deactivation of this TLS certificate through an internal certificate management solution.

## Before you begin

Azion generates Let's Encrypt certificates for domains and subdomains registered in the Domain Name System (DNS). Domains can be acquired and registered into DNS zones through a third-party DNS provider, such as [GoDaddy](http://www.godaddy.com/) or [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/get-a-domain/).

For the purposes of this guide, assume that the fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) that you want to generate a Let's Encrypt certificate for is a CNAME record `www.yourdomain.org` under a `yourdomain.org` DNS zone.

:::note
Azion support for Let's Encrypt certificates is entirely subject to the availability and limitations defined by the Let's Encrypt service, as outlined in its [official documentation](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/).
:::

---

## Generating a Let's Encrypt certificate

You may choose to generate a Let's Encrypt certificate for domain records hosted in [Edge DNS](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-dns/) or in the external DNS provider of your top-level domain.

To that end, you'll have to prepare your DNS server and register records for Azion to be able to create and manage your Let's Encrypt certificate.

:::note
There is also the possibility to [create a Let's Encrypt certificate via Azion CLI](/en/documentation/devtools/cli/create/#digital-certificate-id).
::: 

### Option 1: Preparing DNS entry on Azion Edge DNS

Azion allows you to host DNS zones by redirecting the DNS resolution of a domain to **Edge DNS**. When using Edge DNS, all configurations needed are made through Azion interface.

To create a DNS zone for a domain entry `www.yourdomain.org` in **Edge DNS**:

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Edge DNS**.
2. If you don't have an active zone, click the **+ Zone** button.
3. Give your zone an easy-to-remember name.
4. Indicate the FQDN as recorded in the DNS. Example: `yourdomain.org`.
5. Click the **Save** button.

:::tip
For more information on how to redirect your domain's authoritative DNS servers, check the [Edge DNS](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-dns/) documentation.
:::

Once your DNS resolution has been successfully redirected and is hosted in Edge DNS, you can create a new *CNAME record* for the domain by following the steps:

1. Still on the **Edge DNS** page, select the desired zone.
2. Navigate to the **Records** tab.
3. Click the **+ Record** button.
4. Under **Name**, create a hostname or subdomain.
5. Under **Record Type**, select **CNAME - Canonical name**.
6. Under **Value**, enter the Azion-provided domain address in FQDN format. Example: `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`
   - If you don't have a domain, skip to section [Creating a domain](#creating-a-domain) for more information.
7. Set the **TTL** and **Policy** as desired.
8. Click the **Save** button.

If the **CNAME** entry listed in your Azion domain has been created in your **Edge DNS** zone, Azion will automatically verify the domain authenticity and the Let's Encrypt certificate will become active. Go to the section [Checking the status of Let's Encrypt certificates](#checking-the-status-of-lets-encrypt-certificates) for more information on certificate statuses.

### Option 2: Preparing DNS entry with an external DNS provider

If you have a domain registered in an external DNS zone, Azion will verify the domain authenticity in an external DNS provider by completing Let's Encrypt method called [DNS-01 ACME client challenge](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#dns-01-challenge) to issue the certificate.

:::note
If you already have a zone in **Edge DNS**, the DNS-01 challenge will be completed automatically.
:::

To allow the DNS-01 challenge to occur:

1. Access your DNS provider's website.
2. Navigate to the DNS management area.
3. Create a **CNAME record** for each domain that you want to use with the certificate. Make sure this **CNAME record** matches the value you'll enter in the **CNAME** field when you create your Azion domain. For example:`www.yourdomain.org`.
4. Add a new record to your domain as follows:

| Name | Value | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `_acme-challenge.<your domain>` <br /><br />For example:<br /> `_acme-challenge.www.yourdomain.org` | `<your domain>.letsencrypt.azion.com` <br /><br />Example:<br /> `www.yourdomain.org.letsencrypt.azion.com` | CNAME |

5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for every CNAME you intend to add to your domain.
6. Save your settings.

Now that the challenge can take place, the next step is to bind your domain to an Edge Application.

To create an **Workload**, you must have an edge application. If you haven't created an edge application yet, check the [build an application](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/build-an-application/) documentation.

Once you have an edge application, you need to [create a Workload](/en/documentation/products/secure/workloads) and list the CNAMEs that you want to secure with the Let's Encrypt certificate. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Workloads**.
2. Click the **+ Workload** button.
3. Name your domain. Example: `Domain`.
4. Under the **Subdomain** and **Domain** fields, add the FQDN of the domain you created in the previous sections. Example: `www.yourdomain.org`.
5. Under **Edge Application**, select the application you created.
6. Under **Digital Certificate**, select the option **Let's Encrypt**.
7. Click the **Save** button.

## Checking the status of Let's Encrypt certificates

You can check the status of your Let's Encrypt TLS certificate by following these steps:

<Tabs client:visible>
    <Fragment slot="tab.console">Console</Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.api">API</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.console">

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Digital Certificates**.
2. In your digital certificate list, you'll see a new entry in the format `Domain - Let's Encrypt <timestamp>`.

The status on the right of the list shows you whether the certificate has been issued. An **Active** certificate has been verified and issued successfully. A **Pending** status means the certificate is still undergoing checks in Azion's internal certificate manager.

</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.api">

You can use the following `GET` request:

<Code lang="bash" code={`curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.azion.com/v4/digital_certificates/certificates \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: Token [PERSONAL TOKEN]'`}/>

The `status` field shows you whether the certificate has been issued. An **Active** certificate has been verified and issued successfully. A **Pending** status means the certificate is still undergoing checks in Azion's internal certificate manager.

</Fragment>
</Tabs>

:::note
If the **Pending** status remains for over 48 hours, you must check if the CNAME records you listed in the section [Creating a domain](#creating-a-domain) are correct.

:::tip
For more information on issuing Let's Encrypt certificates, visit the [Digital Certificates for Secure Reference](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-firewall/digital-certificates/#lets-encrypt-certificate).
:::

## Managing a Let's Encrypt certificate

Once the certificate undergoes DNS validation, it won't require manual renewal upon expiration, which occurs after *90 days*. Deactivation will occur if the certificate is deleted or if the associated domain is deleted from Azion.

:::tip
To ensure that the certificate is renewed for domains hosted in external services, **don't delete the DNS challenge entry** you've created in the section [Option 2: Preparing DNS entry with an external DNS provider](#option-2-preparing-dns-entry-with-an-external-dns-provider).

Once you have an active Let's Encrypt certificate, you can point your traffic to Azion by associating your Azion-provided Workload Domain address `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net` to your domain's CNAME record. To do so:

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Workloads**.
2. From the **Workloads** list, copy the Azion-provided domain address that you want to associate to the external domain, which should be in the format `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`
3. In another browser tab, access your DNS provider.
4. Navigate to the DNS management area.
5. Edit the domain CNAME record with the Let's Encrypt certificate as follows:

| Name | Value | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `www.yourdomain.org` | `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net` | CNAME |

6. Save your settings.

Note that there might be a delay in propagation time when you access your application. If that's the case, you can [run the DIG command](/en/documentation/products/guides/run-the-dig-command/) in your terminal to check whether your domain points to the Azion address.
