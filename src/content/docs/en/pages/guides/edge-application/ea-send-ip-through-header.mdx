When a user makes a request to an application, the `X-Forwarded-For` HTTP header stores the client IP. However, since [edge nodes](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/) mediate requests to an edge application, the header also stores other addresses in the request route in addition to the client IP address.

To isolate the client IP, you must forward it to a new header by creating a rule using [Rules Engine](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/rules-engine/) for **Edge Application**.

To send the original client IP through a new request header, follow these steps:

    <Fragment slot="tab.console">Console</Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.rtm">Real-Time Manager</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.console">
1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Edge Application**.
2. Select the edge application you want to apply the solution to.
3. Click the **Rules Engine** tab and select the **Default Rule**.
4. In the **Behavior** section, click the **+ Add Behavior** button.
5. In the new behavior field, select **Add Request Header**.
6. In the argument field, add the following string:
   - `X-Client-IP:${remote_addr}`
7. Click the **Save** button.

After completing the alteration in **Rules Engine**, the IP address of the client that originated the request will be added to the `X-Client-IP` header.
</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.rtm">
1. Access [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. On the top-left corner of the page, go to **Products menu**, represented by the three horizontal lines, and under the **BUILD** section, select **Edge Application**.
3. Select the edge application you want to apply the solution to.
4. Click the **Rules Engine** tab > select the **Default Rule**.
5. In the **Behavior** section, click the **+** button.
6. In the new behavior field, select **Add Request Header**.
7. In the argument field, add the following string:
   - `X-Client-IP:${remote_addr}`
8. Click the **Save** button.

After completing the alteration in **Rules Engine**, the IP address of the client that originated the request will be added to the `X-Client-IP` header.
