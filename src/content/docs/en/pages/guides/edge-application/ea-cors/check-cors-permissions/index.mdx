**Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)** is a mechanism for using HTTP headers to give access permission to specific resources that are on a different origin server to the document in use.

An example of a cross-origin request is an HTML page provided by domain “A”, which requests a file, such as a CSS stylesheet or JavaScript, provided by domain “B”. For security reasons, most browsers prevent cross-origin HTTP requests originated by scripts.

To allow CORS within a configuration for non-complex requests, you must add the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to the response.

Complex HTTP requests require additional headers. These are requests that may involve multiple parameters, headers, authentication, request bodies, or other specialized configurations. Any request apart from `GET`, `POST`, and `HEAD` can be considered complex.

## CORS permission for non-complex HTTP requests

The first step in allowing CORS access is to create a rule in [Rules Engine](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/rules-engine/):

1. Access [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. Select **Products Menu** > **Edge Application**.
3. In the **Rules Engine** tab, create a new rule in **Response Phase**.
4. Fill in the fields as in the following example:

| Field | Value |
|-----------|------|
| **Name** | GET/POST/HEAD CORS |
| **Description** | Allows CORS for GET requests in /your-uri |
| **Criteria** | `${uri}` *starts with* `/your-uri` |
| **Behavior** | **Add Response Header** `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` |

5. Click the **Save** button.

You've now created a rule for non-complex request sharing with CORS.

## CORS permission for complex HTTP requests

In the following example, CORS is being allowed through the `OPTIONS` method. To create a new rule that allows you to enable resource sharing via complex requests, follow the steps:

1. [Access RTM](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. Select **Products menu** > **Edge Application**.
3. In the **Rules Engine** tab, create a new rule in **Response Phase**.
4. Fill in the fields:

| Field | Value |
|-----------|------|
| **Name** | OPTIONS CORS |
| **Description** | Allows CORS for OPTIONS requests in /your-uri, as well as non-complex requests |
| **Criteria** | `${uri}` *starts with* `/your-uri` |
| **Behavior** | **Add Response Header** `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`<br />**Add Response Header** `Access-Control-Request-Method: POST, GET, OPTIONS, HEAD`<br />**Add Response Header** `Content-Type: application/json`<br />**Add Response Header** `Allow: POST, GET, OPTIONS, HEAD`<br />**Add Response Header** `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, GET, OPTIONS, HEAD` |

:::tip
You may configure other complex request types as you want by adding them to the values of the `Allow`, `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, and `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` headers. You can also customize the format of the response in the `Content-Type` header to fit your needs.

5. Click the **Save** button.

## CORS permission for specific origins

To enable CORS within a configuration for specific origin servers, you'll need to enable the [Application Acceleration](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/application-acceleration/) module:

1. [Access RTM](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. Select **Products Menu** > **Edge Application**.
3. Edit the required **Edge Application** configuration.
4. In the **Main Settings** tab, activate the **Application Acceleration** switch.
5. Click the **Save** button.

Now you need to create a rule that processes requests from multiple origins:

1. Go to the **Rules Engine** tab. 
2. Click the **Add Rule** button and select **Response Phase**.
3. Fill in the fields as in the following example:

| Field | Value |
|-----------|------|
| **Name** | Multiple origins CORS |
| **Criteria** | `${http_origin}` *is equal* *http://your.domain1.com*<br />**OR** `${http_origin}` *is equal* *http://your.domain2.com*<br />**OR** `${http_origin}` *is equal* *http://your.domain3.com* |
| **Behavior** | **Add Response Header** `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`<br />**Add Response Header** `Access-Control-Request-Method: POST, GET, OPTIONS, HEAD`<br />**Add Response Header** `Content-Type: application/json`<br />**Add Response Header** `Allow: POST, GET, OPTIONS, HEAD`<br />**Add Response Header** `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, GET, OPTIONS, HEAD` |

4. Click the **Save** button.
