Azion has two user interfaces: Real-Time Manager and Console, which is in *Preview* stage. Currently, Console is only available for Developer plans and new accounts. Follow the steps according to the user interface you're using.
:::

**Error Responses** for Azion **Edge Application** allows you to customize and define the cache TTL of error pages that are delivered when a request returns a 4xx or 5xx HTTP status.

To customize an error response page, follow the steps:

<Tabs client:visible>
    <Fragment slot="tab.console">Console</Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.rtm">Real-Time Manager</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.console">
1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Edge Application**.
2. Select the application linked to the domain that needs the new error page.
3. Select the **Error Responses** tab.
4. The first **Status Code** field is disabled, but in **Default Response TTL** you can set the cache *time-to-live* (TTL), in seconds, of all error pages.
    - This first status code serves as a placeholder to cache the page in case an unexpected status is received.
5. To customize specific error codes, click the **+ Add Error Response** button.
6. In the new **Status Code** field, select the status code you want to customize.
7. Change the cache TTL in the **Custom Response TTL** field.
   - You can keep the same cache TTL set in the previous field or add a different TTL.
8. In the **Page Path** field, you can add a *path* to an error page created in the source.
9. In the **Response Status Code** field, you can customize the HTTP status that will be received by the user.
10. In the **Set Origin** section, you can define the origin of error page URIs.
    - You can configure their origins in the application's **Origins** tab.
11. Click the **Save** button.
