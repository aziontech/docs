Find out how to configure your Azion edge application to show custom error pages for your user based on HTTP error statuses. For this guide you must already have an Edge Application, an Edge Connector and a Workload already setup.

There are separate instructions for API v3 using [legacy Error Responses](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/error-responses/) settings and API v4 using the new [Custom Pages](/en/documentation/products/secure/custom-pages/) product.

To create a Custom Page, follow the steps:

2. Click on the **+ Custom Page** button.
3. To customize specific error codes, click on the **+ Custom Page Code** button.
4. Select the **Page Code**. This represents the code recieved from the Edge Connector when fetching your content.
5. Select the **Edge Connector**.
6. In the **Page Path** field, you can add a *path* to an error page created in your origin.
7. Change the cache TTL in the **Response TTL** field.
8. In the **Response Custom Status Code** field, you can customize the HTTP status that will be received by the user.
9. Click the **Save** button.

Now to bind your Error Pages to your Workload, follow the steps:

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Workloads**.

To customize an error response page, follow the steps:

2. Select the application linked to the domain that needs the new error page.
3. Select the **Error Responses** tab.
4. The first **Status Code** field is disabled, but in **Default Response TTL** you can set the cache *time-to-live* (TTL), in seconds, of all error pages.
    - This first status code serves as a placeholder to cache the page in case an unexpected status is received.
5. To customize specific error codes, click the **+ Add Error Response** button.
6. In the new **Status Code** field, select the status code you want to customize.
7. Change the cache TTL in the **Custom Response TTL** field.
   - You can keep the same cache TTL set in the previous field or add a different TTL.
8. In the **Page Path** field, you can add a *path* to an error page created in the source.
9. In the **Response Status Code** field, you can customize the HTTP status that will be received by the user.
10. In the **Set Origin** section, you can define the origin of error page URIs.
    - You can configure their origins in the application's **Origins** tab.
11. Click the **Save** button.

Done. Your edge application will now display an error page with the new configuration.
