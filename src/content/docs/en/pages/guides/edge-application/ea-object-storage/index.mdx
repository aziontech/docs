**Azion Object Storage** allows you you to create buckets and integrate your file storage with your edge infrastructure. This guide covers how to create a storage bucket, and upload, list, and delete files.

## Create and modify bucket via API

Run the following `POST` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and the `name` with the desired bucket name to create a new read-write bucket:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/storage/buckets' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--data '{
    "name": "my-bucket"
    "edge-access": "read_write"
}'
```

## Option 1: Run cURL commands to upload and download an object from storage

1. To upload an object, run the following `POST` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/), `<bucket_name>` with the name of your bucket, the `Content-Type` header with the MIME type being submitted, and the file sent as a data binary:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/storage/buckets/<bucket_name>/objects' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Content-Type: text/csv' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--data-binary '@./path/file.csv'
```

2. To download the object, run the following `GET` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/), `<bucket_name>` with the name of your bucket, and `<object>` with the path, file name, and extension of the object:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/storage/buckets/<bucket_name>/objects/<object>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]'
```

## Option 2: Run edge function to upload and download object from storage

Now you need to create an edge function to upload files to your bucket using a `POST` console command and see if a file is available using a `GET` console command. To do so:

1. Access [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/) > **Edge Functions**.
2. Click the **Add Function** button.
3. Name your function. Example: `my-bucket POST+GET`
4. In the **Code** tab, add the following Javascript code: 

```js
import Storage from "azion:storage";
async function doGet(path, bucket_name) {
    console.log(`Path: ${path}`);
    const storage = new Storage(bucket_name);
    // content is an StorageObject
    const asset = await storage.get(path);
    return new Response(await asset.arrayBuffer(), {
        headers: {
            "Content-Type": asset.contentType
        },
    });
}

async function doPost(path, content_type, value, bucket_name) {
    console.log(`Path: ${path}`);
    let options = {
        "Content-Type": content_type
    }
    console.log(`Options: ${options}`);
    const storage = new Storage(bucket_name);
    await storage.put(path, value, options);
    return new Response("Object added.");
}

async function router(event) {
    const request = event.request;
    const method = request.method;
    const path = decodeURI(new URL(request.url).pathname);
    const bucket_name = event.args.bucket;
    if (method === "POST") {
        let content_type = request.headers.get("Content-Type");
        let content = await request.arrayBuffer();
        return doPost(path, content_type, content, bucket_name);
    } else if (method === "GET") {
        return doGet(path, bucket_name);
    } else {
        throw new Error(`Invalid method: ${method}. Expected POST or GET.`);
    }
}
addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {
    event.respondWith(
        router(event)
    );
});
```

| Variable | Expected value |
| --- | --- |
| `path` | Path to the file. Example: `./path/file.css` |
| `bucket_name` | The name of the bucket. Example: `my-bucket` |
| `content_type` | The MIME type of the file. Example: `text/css` |
| `value` | The contents of the file as a data binary |

5. In the **Arguments** tab, add the object with the `bucket` property and, as a value, the name of the bucket as a string.

```json
{
  "bucket": "my-bucket"
}
```

:::note
See the [Object Storage API](/en/documentation/devtools/runtime/api-reference/storage/) reference for more details on functions available for other types of requests.

Once you have the edge function ready, you need to create an edge application that will proxy the upload process for the Azion Object Storage.

1. Access [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/) 
2. Select the **Start with a template** option on the homepage.
3. Select the option **Build from scratch**.
4. Give your application an easy-to-remember name. Example: `my-bucket Proxy`.
5. Select the option **Run a Function**.
6. In **Choose Edge Function**, select the edge function you created in the previous steps.
7. Click the **Next** button.
8. Copy the link of the edge application. It should be in the format `http://xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`.
9. Run the following command in your terminal to upload a file:

```
curl -v http://xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net ./path/file.csv txt/csv --data-binary @./path/file.csv my-bucket
```

10. Run the following command in your terminal to download a file:

```
curl -v http://xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net ./path/file.csv my-bucket
```
