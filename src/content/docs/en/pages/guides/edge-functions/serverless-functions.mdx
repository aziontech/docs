[Edge Functions](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-functions/) is a module of the Azion Edge Platform that allows you to program and execute serverless functions.

<LinkButton link="/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-functions-instances/" label="Go to Edge Functions for Edge Application reference" outlined />

To run a function, you must:

- Create your own function or use any of those already available on [Azion Marketplace](https://console.azion.com/marketplace).
- Instantiate a function in an edge application.
- Define activation triggers within [Rules Engine](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/rules-engine/).

## Instantiating an edge function

To demonstrate how to instantiate and run a function on an edge application, this guide will use the pre-configured **Azion - Hello World** function. To instantiate an edge function on an edge application:

<Tabs client:visible>
    <Fragment slot="tab.console">Console</Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.rtm">Real-Time Manager</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.console">
1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Edge Application**.
2. Click on the edge application to which you want to add a function.
3. Go to the **Functions Instances** tab.
4. Click **+ Function Instance**.
5. Name your function instance. For example: `Hello World function`.
6. Select the **Azion - Hello World** function.
7. Click the **Save** button.
</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.rtm">
1. Access [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. On the upper-left corner of the page, click the three horizontal lines to open the **Products menu**.
3. Under the section **BUILD**, select **Edge Application**.
4. Click the edge application you want to add a function.
5. Go to the **Functions** tab.
6. Click **Add Function**.
7. Name your function instance. For example: `Hello World function`.
8. Select the **Azion - Hello World** function.
9. Click the **Save** button.

## Configuring function activation criteria

<Tabs client:visible>
    <Fragment slot="tab.console">Console</Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.rtm">Real-Time Manager</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.console">
1. In the same edge application, go to the **Rules Engine** tab.
2. Click **+ Rule**.
3. Give your rule a name.
4. Select **Request Phase**.
5. In the **Criteria** section, select:
    - If `${uri}` is equal `/hello-world`.
6. In the **Behaviors** section, choose **Run Function**.
7. Select the **Hello World function**
8. Click **Save**. 

Wait a few minutes for the propagation to be completed. 

To see your instanced function, access your application using its domain and the URI set in the rule, which is in the format `xxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/hello-world`.

Now you've successfully configured and instantiated an edge function in an edge application.
