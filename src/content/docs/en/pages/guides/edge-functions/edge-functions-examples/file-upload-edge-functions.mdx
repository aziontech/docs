## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- An [Azion account](https://console.azion.com/)
- [Azion CLI](/en/documentation/products/azion-cli/overview/) installed and configured
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 18 or higher
- **Object Storage** enabled in your Azion account

## Code

This is a code example of how to use Functions with Object Storage to implement a file upload functionality. The complete code example you can find in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/egermano/edge-functions-examples/tree/main/packages/file-upload).

```typescript
import type { AzionBucketObject, AzionStorageResponse } from "azion/storage";
import { createObject } from "azion/storage";
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { fire } from "hono/service-worker";

const app = new Hono();

app.post("/upload", async (c) => {
  const body = await c.req.parseBody();
  const file = body["file"]; // File | string

  // First check if file is a valid File object
  if (
    !file ||
    typeof file !== "object" ||
    typeof file.arrayBuffer !== "function"
  ) {
    return c.json({ message: "Invalid file" }, 400);
  }

  // Check if file size exceeds 2MB limit
  const maxSize = 2 * 1024 * 1024; // 2MB
  if (file.size > maxSize) {
    return c.json({ message: "File size exceeds 2MB limit" }, 413);
  }

  try {
    const { data: newObject, error }: AzionStorageResponse<AzionBucketObject> =
      await createObject({
        bucket: process.env.BUCKET_NAME!,
        key: file.name,
        // @ts-expect-error content is wrongly typed
        content: await file.arrayBuffer(),
      });

    if (error) {
      throw new Error(error.message);
    }

    if (newObject) {
      console.log(`Object created with key: ${newObject.key}`);
    } else {
      console.error("Failed to create object", error);
    }

    // @ts-expect-error content is wrongly typed
    const content = new Uint8Array(newObject.content);

    return c.body(content, {
      status: 200,
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": file.type,
        "Content-Disposition": `attachment; filename="${newObject?.key}"`,
        "Content-Length": newObject?.size?.toString() ?? "0",
      },
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error uploading file:", error);
    return c.json({ message: "Error uploading file" }, 500);
  }
});

fire(app);
```

## Deploying to Azion

### Step 1: Authenticate with Azion

1. Log in to your Azion account via CLI:

```bash
azion login
```

2. Follow the authentication prompts to connect your CLI with your Azion account.

### Step 2: Deploy the Function

Deploy your file upload application to Azion's edge network:

```bash
azion deploy
```

The deployment process will:

- Upload your Function code
- Configure the applications
- Set up the necessary routing rules
- Configure storage permissions
- Provide you with a unique domain

### Step 3: Configure storage permissions

1. Access **Azion Console** > **Object Storage**
2. Select your storage bucket
3. Configure appropriate permissions for your Function to read/write files

### Step 4: Access your application

After deployment, you'll receive a domain like `https://xxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`. Your file upload application will be available at this URL within a few minutes after DNS propagation.

## Understanding the implementation

### File upload process

The file upload Function typically handles:

1. **Request validation**: Checking file types, sizes, and security
2. **Multipart form parsing**: Processing multipart/form-data requests
3. **File processing**: Validating and preparing files for storage
4. **Storage upload**: Saving files to Object Storage
5. **Response generation**: Returning upload status and file information

### Security considerations

- **File type validation**: Only allow specific file types
- **Size limits**: Enforce maximum file size restrictions
- **Virus scanning**: Implement malware detection when possible
- **Access control**: Validate user permissions before uploads
- **Input sanitization**: Clean file names and metadata

### Key benefits

- **Performance**: Upload processing at the edge reduces latency
- **Scalability**: Automatically scales with demand
- **Global reach**: Edge locations provide worldwide coverage
- **Cost efficiency**: Optimized data transfer and storage costs

## Testing your file upload application

### Step 1: Test file upload functionality

1. Navigate to your deployed application
2. Use the upload form to test various file types
3. Verify files are successfully stored in your Object Storage bucket
4. Test file size limits and type restrictions

### Step 2: Test security features

1. **File type validation**: Try uploading restricted file types
2. **Size limits**: Test with files exceeding your size limit
3. **Malicious files**: Test with files containing suspicious content
4. **Path traversal**: Verify file name sanitization

### Step 3: Performance testing

1. **Upload speed**: Test with various file sizes
2. **Concurrent uploads**: Test multiple simultaneous uploads
3. **Error handling**: Test network interruptions and failures

## Common use cases

- **Document management**: Upload and store business documents
- **Image galleries**: Handle photo and image uploads
- **Media content**: Process video and audio file uploads
- **Form attachments**: Handle file attachments in web forms
- **Data import**: Process CSV and data file uploads

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues and solutions

- **Upload failures**: Check file size limits and allowed types
- **Storage errors**: Verify bucket permissions and configuration
- **Performance issues**: Optimize file processing and storage operations
- **Security concerns**: Review file validation and sanitization logic

### Error handling best practices

1. **Clear error messages**: Provide specific feedback to users
2. **Logging**: Implement comprehensive error logging
3. **Retry mechanisms**: Handle temporary failures efficiently
4. **Progress indicators**: Show upload progress for large files

## Advanced features

### Implementing file processing

You can extend the basic upload functionality with:

- **Image resizing**: Automatically resize uploaded images
- **Format conversion**: Convert files to different formats
- **Metadata extraction**: Extract and store file metadata
- **Thumbnail generation**: Create preview images

### Adding authentication

Implement user authentication to secure file uploads:

```javascript
// Example authentication check
function authenticateUser(request) {
    const authHeader = request.headers.get('Authorization');
    // Implement your authentication logic
    return validateToken(authHeader);
}
```

## Next steps

- Explore advanced file processing techniques
- Implement file deletion and management features
- Add user authentication and authorization
- Integrate with other Azion products like Cache
- Monitor upload performance and optimize accordingly
