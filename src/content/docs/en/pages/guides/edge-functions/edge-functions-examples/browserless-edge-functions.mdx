This guide demonstrates how to create a browserless application using Azion Functions. Browserless applications allow you to perform web automation tasks, scraping, and browser-based operations without the overhead of running a full browser instance, making them ideal for edge computing environments.

This demonstration shows how to leverage Functions for browser automation tasks while maintaining high performance and security standards at the edge.

## Requirements

- Basic understanding of JavaScript and Functions
- An Azion account
- [Azion CLI installed and configured](/en/documentation/products/azion-cli/overview/)

## Step 1: Create a new Edge Function

This is a code example of how to use browserless with Azion Functions to take a screenshot. The complete code example you can find in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/egermano/edge-functions-examples/tree/main/packages/browserless).

To create a new Edge Function, follow these steps:

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Functions**.
2. Click on **+ Function**.
3. Give your function a name. Example: `browserless-screenshot`.
4. In the **Code** tab, paste the code from the `main.js` file of the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/egermano/edge-functions-examples/tree/main/packages/browserless).
5. Click the **Save** button.

### Step 2: Create a new Application from a template

To initialize a new Application, follow these steps:

1. Initialize a new Application:

```bash
azion init
```

2. Select the **Edge Application** template.
3. Follow the prompts to configure your new Application.

### Step 3: Configure the Edge Application

To configure the application, follow these steps:

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Applications**.
2. Select the application you created in the previous step.
3. In the **Functions Instances** tab, click **+ Function Instance**.
4. Give your function instance a name. Example: `browserless-screenshot-instance`.
5. Select the `browserless-screenshot` function you created in the previous step.
6. Click the **Save** button.
7. In the **Rules Engine** tab, click **+ Rule**.
8. Give your rule a name. Example: `browserless-screenshot-rule`.
9. Select **Request Phase**.
10. In the **Criteria** section, set the criteria that triggers the behavior every time the URI `/screenshot` is accessed as follows:
    - If `${uri}` *starts with* `/screenshot`
11. In the **Behaviors** section, choose **Run Function**.
12. Select the `browserless-screenshot-instance` function instance.
13. Click the **Save** button.

## Conclusion

This guide provided a comprehensive overview of how to build a browserless application using Azion Functions. By following these steps, you can create efficient, secure, and scalable web solutions at the edge.
