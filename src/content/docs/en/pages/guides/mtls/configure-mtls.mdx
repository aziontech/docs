**Mutual Transport Layer Security (mTLS)** is an encryption protocol based on *Transport Layer Security (TLS)*, which validates the digital certificate on both ends of a request.

To configure mTLS in your applications, you need to activate the service through [Azion Sales Team](https://www.azion.com/en/contact-sales/) in addition to having a digital certificate with mTLS support, provided by a third-party certificate authority. At Azion, this certificate is called **Trusted Certificate (Trusted CA)**.

More information about requirements, digital certificates, Trusted CA, and how mTLS works at Azion is available on the [Support for mTLS page](/en/documentation/products/secure/edge-firewall/mtls/).

## Add a Trusted CA to your Digital Certificates library

With your **Trusted CA** created, you need to add it to your library of **Digital Certificates** in the **Edge Libraries** section:

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Digital Certificates**.
2. Click the **+ Digital Certificate** button.
3. Enter a name to identify this certificate.
4. In the **Import or Request Certificate** section, select the **Import a Trusted CA certificate** option.
5. Enter the content that represents your certificate in the **Private Certificate** field.
- The certificate file must be of `.pem` format â€“ Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM). Example: `certificate.pem`.
6. Click the **Save** button to proceed.

You'll be redirected to the **Digital Certificates** page, where all your certificates are listed, including this newly added one.

## Configure mTLS

After adding a **Trusted CA** to your certificate library, you need to configure which domains or workloads should operate with mTLS. There are separate instructions for [Workloads](/en/documentation/products/secure/workloads/) and [Domains](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/domains/).

<Fragment slot="tab.apiv3">API v3</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.consoleworkloads">

To configure mTLS in Workloads:

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Workloads**.
2. Select the workload you want to configure mTLS for.
3. Navigate to **Protocol Settings**.
4. In **Mutual Authentication Settings**:
   - Enable the **mTLS** switch
   - Choose the verification mode: **Enforce** or **Permissive**
   - Select the **Trusted CA Certificate** from the dropdown menu
5. Click **Save**.

:::note
By selecting **Enforce** verification (default), mTLS is enabled and all incoming traffic will comply with client and server authentication. Choose **Permissive** mode for testing or specific access conditions. The **Permissive** mode requires additional Rules Engine configuration in Edge Firewall.
:::

</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.consoledomain">

To configure mTLS in Domains:

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Domains**.
2. Click on the domain you would like to configure **mTLS** for.
3. Enable the **Mutual Authentication Settings** switch.
4. Choose which verification mode you wish to use: **Enforce** or **Permissive**.
5. Select the **Trusted CA Certificate**, added in the previous step, from the dropdown menu.
6. Click **Save**.

:::note
By selecting **Enforce** verification (default), mTLS is enabled in your edge application and all incoming traffic will comply with client and server authentication. However, if you're looking to test or access your application from specific conditions, choose the **Permissive** mode. The **Permissive** mode requires additional Rules Engine configuration in Edge Firewall.

1. Run the following `PATCH` request to enable mTLS on a Workload, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and `<workload_id>` with your Workload ID:

<Code lang="bash" code={`curl --request PATCH \\
  --url https://api.azion.com/v4/workspace/workloads/<workload_id> \\
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \\
  --header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \\
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\
  --data '{
    "mtls": {
      "verification": "enforce",
      "certificate": <trusted_ca_cert_id>
    }
  }'`} />

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `verification` | Verification mode: `"enforce"` or `"permissive"` |
| `certificate` | ID of your Trusted CA certificate |

2. You'll receive a response with the updated Workload configuration.

1. Run the following `PATCH` request to enable mTLS on a Domain, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and `<domain_id>` with your Domain ID:

<Code lang="bash" code={`curl --request PATCH \\

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `is_mtls_enabled` | Set to `true` to enable mTLS |
| `mtls_verification` | Verification mode: `"enforce"` or `"permissive"` |
| `mtls_trusted_ca_certificate_id` | ID of your Trusted CA certificate |

2. You'll receive a response with the updated Domain configuration.

## Adding specific rules for using Permissive mTLS

To configure the operation of `Permissive` mode: 

1. Still in the Console, go to **Products Menu** > **Edge Firewall**.
2. Select the edge firewall you wish to use or click the **+ Edge Firewall** button to create a new edge firewall.
3. Under **Domains**, select your application domain and click the `>` button to send the chosen domain to **Selected**.
4. Click the **Save** button.
5. Click the **Rules Engine** tab.
6. Click the **+ Rule** button.
7. Choose an identifying name for this rule.
8. Define the **Criteria** and **Behaviors** specific to your need.
- For this example, the logic will be:
    - Criteria: *If* `Host` *is equal* `yourDomain.com` *+ And* `Client Certificate Validation` *is not equal* `true`.
    - Behaviors: *Then* `Deny (403 Forbidden)`.
9. Make sure that the **Status** switch is activated.
10.  Click the *Save* button.

Without mTLS support enabled in your Azion account, the Criteria **Client Certificate Validation** option won't appear.

:::note
In this example, the Rule Set will block `(Error 403 Forbidden)` any incoming network traffic with a *hostname* equal to `yourDomain.com` whose client certificate validation isn't true.

## Specifying mTLS variables in the application header

If your application is part of the Open Banking model, you' wi'll need to specify the variables `${ssl_client_escaped_cert}` and `${ssl_client_s_dn_parsed}` in the *header* of your application. You can also insert other mTLS variables.

<LinkButton link="/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/rules-engine/" label="go to the list of available variables" severity="secondary" />

To add a variable to your application header, follow the steps:

1. Within the **Console**, go to **Products menu** > **Edge Application**.
2. Find and click on the application with mTLS enabled.
3. Select the **Rules Engine** tab.
4. Click the **+ Rule** button.
5. Set an identifier name for this rule.
6. Select **Request Phase**.
7. In the **Criteria** field, change the operator `is equal` to `exists`.
8. In the **Behaviors** field, select the *Add Request Header* option and add the variable you wish to insert in your application's header.
- The use of the prefix `X-` in the `header-name` of custom HTTP variables is discouraged by the HTTP development organization, Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), since 2012 ([RFC 6648](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc6648/)). The IETF recommends using a simple `header-name`, which indicates the actual use of the variable, but which does not conflict with standard variables.
- To add another variable, click the `+ Add Behavior` button.
9. Make sure the **Active** switch is on.
10.  Click the **Save** button.

One way to test these header variables is with the [curl](https://curl.se/) tool. From a directory containing your **Trusted CA** and its key in a `.pem` file (For example: `cert.pem` and `key.pem`), open the terminal and run `curl -skv https://<yourDomain.com>/ -H "pragma:azion-debug-cache" -o /dev/stdout --cert cert.pem --key key.pem`. You should find `header-name:value` from the added variables on the terminal response.
