The Azion **Console Kit**

:::caution[atenção]
To follow this guide, you must first [setup your Console Kit project](/en/documentation/devtools/console-kit/#setting-up-a-project) on a forked repository in your account. After you clone the repository, you can work on changing the Azion Console while keeping your version up-to-date by occasionally synchronizing the forked repository.
