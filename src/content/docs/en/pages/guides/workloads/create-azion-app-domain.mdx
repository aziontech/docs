[Workloads](/en/documentation/products/secure/workloads/) enables you to create an Azion Custom Domain for your application using the format `example.azion.app` to personalize your application address with a user-friendly URL. These names are limited and not shareable among multiple accounts or configurations, and are automatically HTTPS enabled by using Azionâ€™s SAN certificate. This feature is available at no additional cost.

## Create an Workload

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Workloads**.
2. Click the **+ Workload** button.
3. Give your Workload a name.
4. Select the **Infrastructure** for your Workload: **Production Infrastructure** or **Staging Infrastructure** (test environment).
5. Enable the **Custom Domain** switch.
6. Enter the address you want to use.
7. In **Edge Application**, select your Edge Application.
8.  Click the **Save** button.

Wait a few minutes for your new Workload to propagate and access your `xxxxxxxxxx.azion.app` address to see your Edge Application online.
