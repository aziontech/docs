### Details to add in your ticket's description

Add the following information to your ticket's description:

- Provide the URL of the settings on the Azion platform experiencing issues.
- Describe the expected behavior and what is incorrect.
- Specify the conditions under which the problem occurs, such as which browser, application, operating system, internet service provider, and type of internet connection is being used.
- Outline step-by-step instructions for the Support team to replicate the issue.
- Include your UUID value. To obtain it, ensure you're using the problematic device and visit `https://netinfo.azion.com`. Copy the value displayed in the UUID field.
