**Debug Rules** allows you to check whether rules or rule sets created using the **Rules Engine** module for **Edge Application** and **Edge Firewall** have been successfully executed in your application.

<Button href="/en/documentation/products/edge-application/rules-engine/" text="Learn more about Rules Engine"></Button>

You can debug rules using the **GraphQL API**, Azion **Data Streaming**, and Azion **Real-Time Events**.

## Enabling Debug Rules

To debug your rules or rule sets, you must first activate the **Debug Rules** feature on Azion **Real-Time Manager (RTM)**. To enable Debug Rules for Edge Application:

1. [Access RTM](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. Go to **Products menu** > **Edge Application**.
3. Select an existing edge application to activate debug.
4. On the **Main Settings** tab, enable the **Debug Rules** option.
5. Click the **Save** button.

To enable Debug Rules for Edge Firewall:

1. [Access RTM](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. Go to **Products menu** > **Edge Firewall**.
3. Select the rule set you want to configure.
4. On the **Main Settings** tab, enable the **Debug Rules** option.
5. Click the **Save** button.

:::caution[warning]
Debugging is only functional for active rule sets. Make sure to activate any rule set you wish to include in the debugging process.

## Debugging rules with the GraphQL API

> See the [GraphQL API documentation](/en/documentation/products/graphql-api-overview) for more information.

To query the available rules data in the **GraphQL API**, follow the steps described on [How to query GraphQL requests on Postman](/en/documentation/products/guides/query-graphql-postman/) using the `https://api.azionapi.net/events/graphql` URL.

Then, on Postman’s GraphQL request code box, add the following **HTTP Query**, modifying the `tsRange` to fit the time interval you want:

```graphql
query HttpQuery {
  httpEvents(
    limit: 10,
    filter: {
      tsRange: {begin:"2023-02-14T10:10:10", end:"2023-02-15T10:10:10"}
    }
    orderBy: [ts_ASC]
  ) 
  {
    ts
    remoteAddress
    requestUri
    stacktrace
  }
}
```

The example above shows a query for rule data using the **HTTP Events** dataset. The **limit** field filters the last 10 entries within the **tsRange** field. The presented data is ordered through the **ts** (timestamp) field.

The query above should return:

- **ts**: the time range for when each request was initiated.
- **remoteAddress**: the IP of the client that made the request to the application.
- **requestUri**: the type of HTTP request and URI.
- **stacktrace**: executed rules and rule sets.

Send your request. You’ll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "httpEvents": [
      {
        "ts": "2023-02-15T17:52:16Z",
        "remoteAddress": "00.00.000.00",
        "requestUri": "/get",
        "stacktrace": "{\\\"edge_application_response\\\":[\\\"Add Azion Cookie\\\"],\\\"edge_firewall\\\":[\\\"Set WAF\\\",\\\"Rate-Limit Root\\\"],\\\"edge_application_request\\\":[\\\"Default Rule\\\",\\\"Test Send Cert to Origin 1\\\",\\\"Test Send Cert to Origin 2\\\"]}"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

In this example, the **GraphQL API** has returned all active request and response phase rules created for **Edge Application**, as well as an active **Edge Firewall** rule set.

For more information on the **GraphQL API**, visit the [datasets documentation page](/en/documentation/products/graphql-api-features/#datasets).

## Debugging rules using Data Streaming

> See the [Data Streaming documentation](/en/documentation/products/data-streaming/) for more information on how to set it up.

**To debug rules via Data Streaming, follow these steps:**

1. [Access RTM](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. Select **Products menu** > **Data Streaming**.
3. Click **Add Streaming**.
4. Choose a name for your data streaming.
5. On the **Data Source** dropdown menu, select **Edge Applications**.
6. On the **Template** dropdown menu, select **Custom Template**.
7. On the **Data Set** code box, add the following variables:

    ```json
    {
        "time": "$time",
        "traceback": "$traceback"
    }
    ```

8. On **Options**, select between **Filter Domains** or **All Domains**. See more about each option on [How to associate domains on Data Streaming](/en/documentation/products/guides/data-streaming-associate-domains/).
9. On the **Destination** section, select an **Endpoint Type** on the dropdown menu.

    > You'll see different fields depending on the endpoint type you choose. Find more information on each of them on the [Setting an endpoint page](/en/documentation/products/data-streaming/#endpoints).

10. Make sure the **Active** switch is turned on.
11. Click the **Save** button.

To make sure your logs are being sent to your endpoint through the configured data streaming, you can use [Real-Time Events](/en/documentation/products/real-time-events/) to query detailed analysis.

To see all your created data streamings, go to the **Data Streaming** page on RTM and select one from the list. Feel free to create multiple ones.

### Variables definition

| Variable | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| $time | Request date and time. Example: Oct. 31st, 2022 - 19:30:41 |
| $traceback | Provides the names of the rules created using Rules Engine for Edge Application and Edge Firewall that are run by the request. |

## Debugging rules using Real-Time Events

> See the [Real-Time Events documentation](/en/documentation/products/real-time-events/) for more information on how to configure a data streaming endpoint.

**To access Real-Time Events, follow these steps:**

1. [Access RTM](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. On the upper-left corner, select **Products menu** > **Real-Time Events**.
3. On **Data Source**, select **Edge Applications**.
4. Modify the desired time range and add filters if needed.
5. Click the **Search** button.
6. Select the log body you want to inspect.
7. Look for the **traceback** field.

The **traceback** field should contain the type of rule executed and the behavior triggered within the selected time range. For instance:

```yaml
{\"edge_application_response\":[\"Add Azion Cookie\"],\"edge_firewall\":[\"Set WAF\",\"Rate-Limit Root\"],\"edge_application_request\":[\"Default Rule\",\"Test Send Cert to Origin 1\",\"Test Send Cert to Origin 2\"]}
```

In this example, the **traceback** field contains all active request and response phase rules created for **Edge Application**, as well as an active **Edge Firewall** rule set.
