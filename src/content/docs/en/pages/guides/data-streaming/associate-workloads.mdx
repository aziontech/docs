[Data Stream](/en/documentation/products/observe/data-stream/) is an **Observe** product that allows you to feed your SIEM, big data, and stream processing platforms with the event logs from your applications on Azion in real time.

When you associate Workloads with Data Stream, the events related to the specified workloads are collected and sent to the endpoint you configure through a stream. You can associate one or more of your workloads registered with Azion to a stream.

To associate Workloads on Data Stream, follow these steps:

1. [Access Azion Console](https://console.azion.com).
2. On the upper-left corner, select **Data Stream** on the **Observe** section.
3. Click **+ Stream**.
4. Choose a name for your stream.
5. On the **Source** dropdown menu, select the one you want to use.
6. On the **Template** dropdown menu, select the one you want to use.
7. On **Workloads** > **Option**, select between **All Current and Future Workloads** or **Filter Workloads**.

- If you've selected **Filter Workloads**:

On the **Available Workloads** box, you can:
    - Type characters or words to find workloads or scroll through the list of your workloads.
    - Select each domain you want to associate with this stream and click the `>` button.
    - Select multiple workloads by using `ctrl` on Windows and Linux or `command` on Mac and click the `>` button.
    - Select `>>` to select all workloads presented on the list.

After you click the `>` button, the selected workloads are moved to the **Chosen Workloads** box. You can also use the `<` button to remove specific workloads already chosen or select `<<` to remove all workloads.

- If you've selected **All Workloads**:

Azion automatically selects all *current* and *future* workloads associated to your Azion Console account using this stream.

After associating the workloads of your choice:

1. Fill in the remaining [mandatory fields to configure your stream](/en/documentation/products/guides/use-data-stream/).
2. Make sure the **Active** switch is on.
3. Click **Save**.

Now, the events associated with the workloads you selected will be collected and sent to its endpoint through the configured stream.
