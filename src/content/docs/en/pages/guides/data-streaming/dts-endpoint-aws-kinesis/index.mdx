While configuring [data streamings](/en/documentation/products/data-streaming/), you need to set up a specific endpoint to stream your Azion data.

Continue reading for a step by step on how to connect an [Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-firehose/) endpoint to receive data from Data Streaming.

## Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose requirements

To start using **Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose**, follow the steps:

1. Create an account on [Amazon AWS](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup).
2. In the AWS dashboard, create [an instance](https://console.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/home).
3. Fill in the requested information.
4. Create an [Amazon S3 bucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/creating-bucket.html).

You'll also need to create and save the following information:

- Stream Name
- Region
- Access Key
- Secret Key

See how to obtain them while still on the AWS platform:

### Stream Name

1. Go to the [Amazon Kinesis console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/home) homepage.
2. On **Get started**, select **Kinesis Data Firehose** as an option.
3. Click the **Create delivery stream** button. You'll be redirected to your stream creation page.
4. In the **Choose source and destination** section, on **Source**, select **Direct PUT**.
5. On **Destination**, select **Amazon S3**. The rest of the configuration options will load.
6. In the **Delivery stream name** section, choose a delivery stream name according to what you find most convenient.
7. Keep the other options with the default value.
8. In the **Destination Settings** section, on **S3 bucket**, click **browse** and select a previously created S3 bucket. You can also click the **Create** button and create a new one now.
9. Keep the other options with the default value.
10. Click on **Create a delivery flow**.

You can find more details on the AWS [Creating the Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/firehose-example-create-delivery-stream.html).

### Region

This is the region where your AWS Kinesis instance is running.

1. On the top bar of your dashboard, right next to the help button with the **'?'** icon, you find a dropdown menu, the Regions selector, where you can see the name of the region and its code.
2. Find the code and keep it to use it later. It looks similar to this: `us-east-1`

You can find more details on the AWS [Regions and Zones documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html).

### Access Key and Secret Key

1. Access the [Identify and Access Management (IAM)](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/security_credentials$access_key) panel > click the **Create new access key** button.
2. A pop-up will appear on the screen with your key information.
3. Click on **Display Access Key** to display your key information as indicated below:
    - **Access Key ID**, with a format similar to `AKIA5LVCRTER524RAIA3`
    - **Secret Access Key**, with a format similar to `N9UTjunb299M5ryfKdG2cKh2+Pe2mBiGZXaBpVff`
4. Save the two keys information in a safe place to use them later on Azion Data Streaming.

> You can also download the **EMP file** with the information for the keys.

## Configuring the endpoint in Data Streaming

Next, follow these steps to configure the new endpoint you created in **Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose** in your Azion **Data Streaming**.

You can find detailed steps for the entire configuration on the [How to use Data Streaming guide](/en/documentation/products/guides/use-data-streaming/).

In the **Destination** configurations:

1. On the **Endpoint Type** dropdown menu, select **AWS Kinesis Data Firehose**.
2. On **Stream Name**, add the name you gave your delivery Kinesis Firehose stream.
3. On **Region**, add the region configured on your stream.
4. On **Access Key**, add the access key you created for your stream.
5. On **Secret Key**, add the secret key you created for your stream.
6. Make sure the **Active** switch is on.
7. Click the **Save** button.

After saving the configurations, your data will be streamed to the newly configured endpoint.

You can keep track of the calls made by Data Streaming to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose on [Real-Time Events](/en/documentation/products/real-time-events/). To do so, select **Data Source** > **Data Streaming** and choose the filters options as you wish.
