While configuring [data streamings](/en/documentation/products/data-streaming/), you need to set up a specific endpoint to stream your Azion data.

Continue reading for a step by step on how to connect an [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/) endpoint to receive data from Data Streaming.

## Splunk requirements

To use **Splunk** as a destination for your logs, you'll need to:

1. Create a [Splunk account](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/splunk-cloud.html).
2. Create and configure a [HTTP Event Collector (HEC)](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Data/UsetheHTTPEventCollector#Set_up_and_use_HTTP_Event_Collector_in_Splunk_Web) instance corresponding to the type of Splunk instance you're using.
3. Save your event collector URL.
4. Create a [HEC token](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Data/UsetheHTTPEventCollector#Create_an_Event_Collector_token).
5. [Enable the created HEC token](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Data/UsetheHTTPEventCollector#Enable_and_disable_Event_Collector_tokens).
6. Save the HEC token you've enabled and your event's connector URL.

The URL structure for your event collector varies depending on the Splunk instance you're using:

| Instance Type | URL |
| ------------- | --- |
| Self-hosted | `https://<host>:<port>/services/collector/event` |
| Self-service Splunk Cloud plans | `https://input-<host>:<port>/services/collector/event` |
| Other Splunk Cloud plans | `<protocol>://http-inputs-<host>:<port>/services/collector/event` |

Find more details about configurations in the [Splunk documentation page](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation).

## Configuring the endpoint in Data Streaming

Next, follow these steps to configure the new endpoint you created in **Splunk** in your Azion **Data Streaming**.

You can find detailed steps for the entire configuration on the [How to use Data Streaming guide](/en/documentation/products/guides/use-data-streaming/).

In the **Destination** configurations:

1. On the **Endpoint Type** dropdown menu, select **Splunk**.
2. On **Splunk URL**, add the URL from your Splunk event's connector. If you have an alternative index to point, you can add it at the end of the URL. Example: `https://inputs.splunkcloud.com:8080/services/collector?index=myindex`
3. On **API Key**, add the HTTP Event Collector Token provided in your Splunk installation. Example: `cret248d6-22p8-95gw-g5ke-6k45w2sal634`
4. Make sure the **Active** switch is on.
5. Click the **Save** button.

After saving the configurations, your data will be streamed to the newly configured endpoint.

You can keep track of the calls made by Data Streaming to Splunk on [Real-Time Events](/en/documentation/products/real-time-events/). To do so, select **Data Source** > **Data Streaming** and choose the filters options as you wish.
