[Data Streaming](/en/documentation/products/data-streaming/) is an **Observe** product that allows you to feed your SIEM, big data, and stream processing platforms with the event logs from your applications on Azion in real time.

When you associate domains with Data Streaming, the events related to the specified domains are collected and sent to the endpoint you configure through a data streaming. You can associate one or more of your domains registered with Azion to a data streaming.

To associate domains on Data Streaming, follow these steps:

1. [Access RTM](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. On the upper-left corner, select **Data Streaming** on the **OBSERVE** section.
3. Click **Add Streaming**.
4. Choose a name for your data streaming.
5. On the **Data Source** dropdown menu, select the one you want to use.
6. On the **Template** dropdown menu, select the one you want to use.
7. On **Options**, select between **Filter Domains** or **All Domains**.

- If you've selected **Filter Domains**:

1. Go to the **Domains** section.
2. On the **Available Domains** box, you can:
    - Type characters or words to find domains or scroll through the list of your domains.
    - Select each domain you want to associate to this data streaming and click the **>** button.
    - Select multiple domains by using `ctrl` on Windows and Linux or `command` on Mac and click the **>** button.
    - Select **Choose all** to select all domains presented on the list.

After you click the **>** button, the selected domains are moved to the **Chosen Domains** box. You can also use the **`<`** button to remove specific domains already chosen or select **Clear selection** to remove all domains.

- If you've selected **All Domains**:

Azion automatically selects all *current* and *future* domains associated to your RTM account using this data streaming.

After associating the domains of your choice:

1. Fill in the remaining [mandatory fields to configure your data streaming](/en/documentation/products/guides/use-data-streaming/).
2. Make sure the **Active** switch is on.
3. Click **Save**.

Now, the events associated with the domains you selected will be collected and sent to its endpoint through the configured data streaming.
