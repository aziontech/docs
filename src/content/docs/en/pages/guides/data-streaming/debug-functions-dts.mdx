The debugging process in edge functions' code on [Data Stream](/en/documentation/products/observe/data-stream/) helps you identify if errors are still occurring or if the process was successful.

Before analyzing the process, you need to apply the debugging code. Find out more on [Debugging edge functions](/en/documentation/devtools/debugging/).


## Setting up Data Stream to debug edge functions

After applying the debugging code for edge functions:

1. [Access Azion Console](https://console.azion.com).
2. On the upper-left corner, select **Data Stream** on the **Observe** section.
3. Click **+ Stream**.
4. Choose a name for your stream.
5. On the **Source** dropdown menu, select **Edge Functions**.
6. On the **Template** dropdown menu, select **Edge Functions Event Collector**.
7. On the **Data Set** code box, add the following variables:

```json
{
	"time": "$time",
    "global_id": "$global_id",
    "edge_function_id": "$edge_function_id",
    "request_id": "$request_id",
    "log_level": "$log_level",
    "log_message": "$log_message"
}
```

8. On **Workloads** > **Options**, select between **All Current and Future workloads** or **Filter workloads**. See more about each option on [How to associate workloads on Data Stream](/en/documentation/products/guides/data-stream-associate-workloads/).
9. On the **Destination** section, select a **Connector** on the dropdown menu. See more about [setting an endpoint](/en/documentation/products/observe/data-stream/#endpoints).
    - You'll see different fields depending on the connector type you choose.

Finally, to finish your stream setup:

1. Make sure the **Active** switch is turned on.
2. Click the **Save** button.

Now, you'll be able to analyze the behavior of the edge functions debugging process through the logs sent to your configured stream.
