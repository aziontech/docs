## Configuring the endpoint in Data Streaming

Next, follow these steps to configure the new endpoint you created in **Datadog** in your Azion **Data Streaming**.

You can find detailed steps for the entire configuration on the [How to use Data Streaming guide](/en/documentation/products/guides/use-data-streaming/).

In the **Destination** configurations:

1. On the **Endpoint Type** dropdown menu, select **Datadog**.
2. On **Datadog URL**, add the URL of your Datadog endpoint. Example: `http-intake.logs.datadoghq.com`
3. On **API Key**, add the key created in the Datadog API. Example: `a724716c63d1eeos5b20464w72f9ew495`
4. Make sure the **Active** switch is on.
5. Click the **Save** button.

After saving the configurations, your data will be streamed to the newly configured endpoint.

You can keep track of the calls made by Data Streaming to Datadog on [Real-Time Events](/en/documentation/products/real-time-events/). To do so, select **Data Source** > **Data Streaming** and choose the filters options as you wish.
