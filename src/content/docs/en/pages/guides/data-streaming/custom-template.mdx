**Data Stream** is an **Observe** product that allows you to feed your SIEM, big data, and stream processing platforms with the event logs from your applications on Azion in real time.

While [configuring a Data Stream](/en/documentation/products/guides/use-data-stream/) on **Azion Console**, after choosing a data source on Data Stream, you have two options:

- Use the pre-set template for that specific data source, which sends data for all available variables.
- Use the **Custom Template**, which allows you to customize which variables you want to use on your analysis according to your needs.

You can inform the exact variables you want to send as data through a JSON format, and each request is separated from the other with the `\n` character.

To use the Custom Template option on Data Stream, follow these steps:

1. [Access Azion Console](https://console.azion.com/).
2. On the upper-left corner, select **Data Stream** on the **OBSERVE** section.
3. Click **Add Streaming**.
4. Choose a name for your Data Stream.
5. On the **Data Source** dropdown menu, select the one you want to use.
6. On the **Template** dropdown menu, select **Custom Template**.
7. On the **Data Set** code box, add the variables you want to use to receive your data.

You can see the entire list of variables and their descriptions for each data set on the [Data Stream documentation](/en/documentation/products/observe/data-stream/). Or, you can navigate through the pre-set templates on Azion Console by clicking on the **Template** dropdown menu and then copying the variables you desire.

Here's an example of a custom template for the **Edge Applications** data source. The pre-set template currently contains about 50 variables, but you may only need 10 variables for your data analysis. Then, you can add the variables you want to use in the **Data Set** code box:

```json
{
	"time": "$time",
    "session_id": "$session_id",
    "host": "$host",
    "status": "$status",
    "bytes_sent": "$bytes_sent",
    "upstream_bytes_received": "$upstream_bytes_received",
    "server_port": "$server_port",
    "remote_port": "$remote_port",
    "country": "$country",
    "state": "$state"
}
```

After adding the variables of your choice:

1. Fill in the remaining mandatory fields to configure your Data Stream.
2. Make sure the **Active** switch is on.
3. Click **Save**.

Now, your configured Data Stream will send only the data related to the variables you added in the Custom Template.
