Top X queries are mainly used for performing queries and analysis on data. They help visualize how resources and tools are being used and provide a more detailed analysis of certain conditions that are either more or less commonly used.

To query Top X queries through the [GraphQL API](/en/documentation/products/graphql-api-overview), follow the steps described on [How to query GraphQL requests on Postman](/en/documentation/products/guides/query-graphql-postman/) using the `https://api.azionapi.net/events/graphql` URL.

Then, on Postman’s GraphQL request code box, add the following **Top X Query**, modifying the `tsRange` to fit the time interval you want:

```graphql
query EventsTopUri {
 httpEvents(
   limit: 5,
   filter: {
     tsRange: {begin:"2022-11-20T10:10:10", end:"2022-11-27T10:10:10"}
   },
   aggregate: {count: requestUri}
   groupBy: [requestUri]
   orderBy: [count_DESC]
   )
 {
   requestUri
   count
 }
}
```

The example queries the **Events** app for **raw** data with the **HTTP** dataset. In addition, the **count** operator requests data aggregation with information from the **requestUri** field during a set period of time, informed through the **tsRange** field. The API response was also limited to 5 registers by using the **limit** field.

Lastly, data were aggregated (**groupBy**) by the **requestUri** field and sorted (**orderBy**) by the return of the **count** operator in a **descending** (**DESC**) order. That way, the largest amount of aggregation responses is shown first.

To query aggregating data, it's *mandatory* to inform:

- A time range interval for queries, using either **tsRange** or **tsGt** + **tsLt**.
- The fields whose information you want to group, using **groupBy**.
- Which consulted data should be exhibited. On the presented example, the **requestUri** and **count** fields were used, in which **count** represents the response of the **requestUri** aggregation.

Send your request. You’ll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
   "data": {
       "httpEvents": [
           {
               "requestUri": "/requests/images",
               "count": 610081
           },
           {
               "requestUri": "/path/to/file/document",
               "count": 6270
           },
           {
               "requestUri": "/send/stock",
               "count": 3568
           }
       ]
   }
}
```

The GraphQL API returned the **Top RequestUri** query data according to the query informed in the request.
