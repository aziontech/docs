Metadata are relevant information regarding the scope of data in the [GraphQL API](/en/documentation/products/graphql-api-overview). They can help you understand the relationship and the utility of the request processes.

To check GraphQL API's metadata, follow the steps described on [How to query GraphQL requests on Postman](/en/documentation/products/guides/query-graphql-postman/) using the `https://api.azionapi.net/metrics/graphql` URL.

Then, on Postman’s GraphQL request code box, add the following **Introspection Query**:

```graphql
query introspectionQuery {
 __type(name: "Query") {
   name
   description
   fields {
       name
       description
       type {
           ofType {
               fields {
                   name
                   type {
                       name
                      }
                  }
              }
          }
      }
  }
}
```

Send your request. You’ll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
   "data": {
       "__type": {
           "name": "Query",
           "description":  "Class responsible for gathering the queries from the datasets and returning them in the form of graphql schema to the Django view.",
           "fields": [
               {
                   "name": "dataStreamedMetrics",
                   "description": "Query dataStreamed Aggregated with aggregate options.",
                   "type": {
                       "ofType": {
                           "fields": [
                               {
                                   "name": "ts",
                                   "type": {
                                       "name": "CustomDateTime"
                                   }
                               },
                               {
                                   "name": "endpointType",
                                   "type": {
                                       "name": "String"
                                   }
                               }
                           ]
                       }
                   }
               },
               {
                    "name": "httpMetrics",
                    "description": "Query Http Aggregated with aggregate options.",
                    "type": {
                        "ofType": {
                            "fields": [
                                {
                                    "name": "ts",
                                    "type": {
                                        "name": "CustomDateTime"
                                    }
                                },
                                {
                                    "name": "configurationId",
                                    "type": {
                                        "name": "String"
                                    }
                                }
                            ]
                       }
                   }
               }
           ]
       }
   }
}
```

The API returns the following metadata:

- Datasets available to query, such as **dataStreamedMetrics** and **httpMetrics**.
- Available fields for each dataset query.
- Each type for returnable fields, such as **Int**, **String**, **DateTime**, and so on.

For more information on the available datasets with the GraphQL API, visit the [datasets documentation page](/en/documentation/products/graphql-api-features/#datasets).
