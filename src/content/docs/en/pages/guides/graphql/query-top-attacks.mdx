You can use information from the `httpMetrics` dataset to monitor traffic patterns, detect anomalies, and analyze potential threats. This guide explains how to filter the top attack types, ranked by occurrence, as identified by the WAF.

## Querying data

To query the Top 5 attacks, identified by the WAF and ranked by occurrence, proceed as follows:

1. Access the GraphiQL Playground at this link: `https://manager.azion.com/metrics/graphql`.
    - You must be logged in to your Azion account. Otherwise, you'll receive an error message.
2. Send a query following this format:

```graphql
query Top5Attacks {
  httpMetrics(
    limit: 5
    filter: {
      tsRange: {
        begin:"2025-01-15T00:00:00"
        end:"2025-01-15T20:00:00"
      }
    }
    groupBy:[wafAttackFamily]
    orderBy:[wafRequestsThreat_DESC]
  )
  {
    wafAttackFamily
    wafRequestsThreat
  }
}
```
Where:

| Field | Description |
|----------|----------|
| `limit` | Specifies the maximum number of results to return. In this case, `5` |
| `filter` | Defines the criteria used to filter the data returned by the query |
| `tsRange` | A subfield of `filter`. Specifies a time range for filtering data. It includes `begin` and `end` fields to define the start and end date and times. Format: `"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss"`; example: `"2024-04-11T00:00:00"` |
| `orderBy` | Specifies the order in which the results should be returned. Examples: `[wafRequestsThreat_DESC]`, for descending order, and `[wafRequestsThreat_ASC]`, for ascending order |
| `groupBy` | Specifies the fields by which the query results should be grouped. In the example: `[wafAttackFamily]` to group by attack families detected by the WAF |

:::note
This example retrieves data for `wafAttackFamily` and the total of requests  (`wafRequestsThreat`) flagged as threats by the WAF within the specified time range. The results are grouped by attack families and ranked by the number of requests in descending order.

3. You'll receive a response similar to this: 

```graphql
{
  "data": {
    "httpMetrics": [
      {
        "wafAttackFamily": "$OTHERS",
       "wafRequestsThreat": 1449942
      },
       {
        "wafAttackFamily": "$SQL, $XSS",
       "wafRequestsThreat": 1171825
      },
      {
        "wafAttackFamily": "$RFI",
       "wafRequestsThreat": 370811
      },
       {
        "wafAttackFamily": "$SQL, $XSS, $TRAVERSAL",
       "wafRequestsThreat": 216747
      },
      {
        "wafAttackFamily": "$SQL",
       "wafRequestsThreat": 191808
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Where: 

| Field | Description |
|----------|----------|
| `wafAttackFamily` | Category or type of attack detected by the Web Application Firewall (WAF), based on their characteristics. Example: `$SQL`, `$RFI`, `$SQL`, `$XSS`, `$OTHERS` |
| `wafRequestsThreat` | Total number of requests flagged as threats by the WAF, ranked by the most frequent attack types. Example: `216747` |
