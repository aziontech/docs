The **connectedUsersMetrics** dataset lets you get real-time aggregated data, provided by Azion Live Ingest, related to the number of users connected to your applications with live streamings. This dataset is part of the Real-Time Metrics GraphQL API and is generated from the raw HTTP events, which are populated just for clients with live streaming configurations.

This information can be accessed through the GraphQL API, allowing you to transfer this data to a third-party platform, and enabling you to further analysis and review of user activity and engagement. Additionally, the data is available for up to *2 years*.

This guide will explain how to query Connected Users data using the GraphiQL playground.

:::note
To retrieve this data, you must be subscribed to [Azion Live Ingest](https://www.azion.com/en/solutions/live-streaming-delivery/) and use the [GraphQL API](/en/documentation/devtools/graphql-api/overview/).

## Querying data by host

To query your data by host, proceed as follows:

1. Access the [GraphiQL playground](https://manager.azion.com/metrics/graphql)
    - You must be logged in to your Azion account. Otherwise, you'll receive an error message.
2. Send a query following this format:

```bash
query ConnectedUsers {
    connectedUsersMetrics(
        limit: 10000,
        filter: {
            tsRange:{
                begin: "2024-04-10T00:00:00",
                end: "2024-04-11T00:00:00"
            }
        },
      	 groupBy: [ts,host]
        orderBy: [ts_DESC]
    ) {
        ts,
	 host,
        uniqueSessions
    }
}
```

Where:

| Field | Description |
|----------|----------|
| `limit` | Specifies the maximum number of results to return. System maximum: `10000` |
| `filter` | Defines the criteria used to filter the data returned by the query |
| `tsRange` | A subfield of `filter`. Specifies a time range for filtering data. It includes `begin` and `end` fields to define the start and end timestamps. Format: `"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss"`; example: `"2024-04-11T00:00:00"` |
| `groupBy` | Specifies the fields by which the query results should be grouped. Example: `[ts]` |
| `orderBy` | Specifies the order in which the results should be returned. Examples: `[ts_DESC]`, for descending order, and `[ts_ASC]`, for ascending order |
| `ts` | A field in the result set representing the timestamp of the data point |
| `host` | A field in the result set representing the host from which the data was collected |
| `uniqueSessions` | A field in the result set representing the number of unique sessions recorded by the host |

3. You'll receive a JSON response similar to this: 

```bash
{
  "data": {
    "connectedUsersMetrics": [
      {
        "ts": "2024-04-10T00:00:00",
  "host": "example.net",
        "uniqueSessions": 120
      },
      {
        "ts": "2024-04-10T00:00:00",
  "host": "example.net",
        "uniqueSessions": 175
      },
      {
        "ts": "2024-04-10T00:00:00",
  "host": "example.net",
        "uniqueSessions": 136
      },
      {
        "ts": "2024-04-10T00:00:00",
  "host": "example.net",
        "uniqueSessions": 100
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Where: 

| Field | Description |
|----------|----------|
| `ts` | Timestamp of when the event was created |
| `host` | Host information sent on the request line. Stores: hostname from the request line, or hostname from the “Host” request header field, or the server name matching a request |
| `uniqueSessions` | Unique sessions calculated for a given host |

## Querying total data

To retrieve total values, without filtering by host, you must use the field `uniqueSessionsTotal`:

1. Access the [GraphiQL playground](https://manager.azion.com/metrics/graphql)
    - You must be logged in to your Azion account. Otherwise, you'll receive an error message.
2. Send a query following this format:

```bash
query ConnectedUsers {
    connectedUsersMetrics(
        limit: 10000,
        filter: {
            tsRange:{
                begin: "2024-04-10T00:00:00",
                end: "2024-04-11T00:00:00"
            }
        },
      	 groupBy: [ts]
        orderBy: [ts_DESC]
    ) {
        ts,
        uniqueSessionsTotal
    }
}
```

Where:

| Field | Description |
|----------|----------|
| `limit` | Specifies the maximum number of results to return. System maximum: `10000` |
| `filter` | Defines the criteria used to filter the data returned by the query |
| `tsRange` | A subfield of `filter`. Specifies a time range for filtering data. It includes `begin` and `end` fields to define the start and end timestamps. Format: `"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss"`; example: `"2024-04-11T00:00:00"` |
| `groupBy` | Specifies the fields by which the query results should be grouped. Example: `[ts,host]` |
| `orderBy` | Specifies the order in which the results should be returned. Accepted values: `[ts_DESC]`, for descending order, and `[ts_ASC]`, for ascending order |
| `ts` | A field in the result set representing the timestamp of the data point |
| `uniqueSessionsTotal` | A field in the result set representing the number of unique sessions recorded across all hosts for the specified time range |

3. You'll receive a JSON response similar to this: 

```bash
{
  "data": {
    "connectedUsersMetrics": [
      {
        "ts": "2024-04-10T00:00:00",
        "uniqueSessionsTotal": 169
      },
      {
        "ts": "2024-04-10T00:00:00",
        "uniqueSessionsTotal": 175
      },
      {
        "ts": "2024-04-10T00:00:00",
        "uniqueSessionsTotal": 120
      },
      {
        "ts": "2024-04-10T00:00:00",
        "uniqueSessionsTotal": 100
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Where: 

| Field | Description |
|----------|----------|
| `ts` | Timestamp of when the event was created |
| `uniqueSessionsTotal` | Total unique sessions calculated among all hosts |
