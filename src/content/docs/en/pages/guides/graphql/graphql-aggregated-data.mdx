Aggregated data can also be considered as structured data that have been clustered. They go through modifications to allow a better analytic processing seeking a segmented analysis.

To query the available aggregated data in the [GraphQL API](/en/documentation/products/graphql-api-overview), follow the steps described on [How to query GraphQL requests on Postman](/en/documentation/products/guides/query-graphql-postman/) using the `https://api.azionapi.net/metrics/graphql` URL.

Then, on Postman’s GraphQL request code box, add the following **Aggregated Query**, modifying the `tsRange` to fit the time interval you want:

```graphql
query HttpQuery {
  httpMetrics(
    limit: 10,
    filter: {
      tsRange: {begin:"2022-03-21T10:10:10", end:"2022-06-23T10:10:10"}
    }
    aggregate: {sum: bytesSent}
    groupBy: [ts]
    orderBy: [ts_ASC]
  )
  {
    ts
    sum
  }
}
```

On the example above, you'll query for an aggregated table of the **HTTP** dataset. Furthermore, the **sum** operator was used to request the aggregated data with information regarding the **bytesSent** field in a set range of time periods, informed through the **tsRange** field.

Lastly, the presented data were grouped and ordered through the **ts** (timestamp) field.

Send your request. You’ll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
   "data": {
       "httpMetrics": [
           {
               "ts": "2022-06-09T21:33:13",
               "sum": 1471.0
           },
           {
               "ts": "2022-06-09T21:33:14",
               "sum": 1471.0
           },
           {
               "ts": "2022-06-09T21:33:15",
               "sum": 1471.0
           }
       ]
   }
}
```

The GraphQL API returned the aggregated data with the **sum** operator for the **bytesSent** field, according to the query informed in the request.
