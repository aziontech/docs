The **workloadConsumptionMetrics** dataset lets you get real-time aggregated data related to consumption and usage of Azion Products, including Edge Application.

The information can be accessed through the GraphQL API, allowing you to transfer this data to a third-party platform, and enabling you to further analyze and review it. Additionally, the data is available for up to *24 months*.

:::tip
If you're not sure which steps apply to your account, see [this guide](/en/documentation/products/guides/verify-account-migration/) to determine if your account has already been migrated.
:::

Using the [GraphiQL Playground](/en/documentation/products/devtools/graphql-playground/), you can query data related to:

- `data_transferred_total`: total amount of data transferred through Edge Application.
- `requests`: total number of requests received and processed by Edge Application.
- `waf_requests`: total number of requests inspected by WAF.

To query usage data for Workloads:

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Workloads**.
2. Select your workload.
3. Navigate to **Analytics** tab.
4. View consumption metrics:
   - **Requests**: total processed requests
   - **Data Transferred**: bandwidth usage
   - **WAF Requests**: security-inspected requests
5. Export data for further analysis or integrate with third-party tools.

:::note
With Workloads, consumption data is automatically filtered for your specific workload.

To query usage data via traditional interface:

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Analytics**.
2. Select **Edge Application** product.
3. Configure time range and filters.
4. View consumption reports for requests, data transfer, and WAF usage.

To query usage data via GraphQL API v4:

1. Access the GraphiQL Playground at: `https://api.azion.com/v4/consumption/graphql`
    - You must be logged in to your Azion account. Otherwise, you'll receive an error message.
2. Send a query following this format:</Fragment>

```graphql
query {
  workloadConsumptionMetrics(
    filter: {
      tsRange: { 
        begin: "2025-02-01T00:00:00",
        end: "2025-03-01T00:00:00",
      }
      isEdgeFirewallActive: true
      productId: 1441740010
      metricNameIn: ["requests", "data_transferred_total"]
    }
    aggregate: {
      sum: accounted
    }
    limit: 10000
    groupBy: [clientId, workloadId, productId, metricName]
  ) {
    clientId
    workloadId
    productId
    metricName
    total: sum
  }
}
```

Where:

| Field | Description |
|----------|----------|
| `filter` | Defines the criteria used to filter the data returned by the query. |
| `tsRange` | A subfield of `filter`. Specifies a time range for filtering data. It includes `begin` and `end` fields to define the start and end timestamps. Format: `"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss"`; example: `"2024-04-11T00:00:00"`. |
| `sum: accounted` | As a subfield of `aggregate`, calculates the total accounted usage for events matching the query’s filters and groups. |
| `limit` | Specifies the maximum number of results to return. System maximum: `10000`. |
| `groupBy` | Specifies the fields by which the query results should be grouped. Example: `[clientId, metricName]`. |
| `productId` | Unique identifier of the product being used. In this case, `1441740010` for Edge Application. |
| `metricName` | Name of the calculated metric for analytics. In this case, `requests` and `data_transferred_total`. |
| `isEdgeFirewallActive: true` | Optional. Filters transferred data with Edge Firewall active. Available values: `isEdgeFirewallActive`, `isLoadBalancerActive`, `isImageProcessorActive`, and `isApplicationAcceleratorActive`. | 

:::note
This example retrieves data for the total number of requests processed and data transferred by Edge Application. The results are grouped by `clientId` and `workloadId`. To learn more about the available fields, check the [Consumption GraphQL API Fields](/en/documentation/devtools/graphql-api/features/gql-consumption-fields/) documentation.
