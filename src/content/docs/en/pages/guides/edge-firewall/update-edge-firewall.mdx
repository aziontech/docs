Previously, to use a rule set from Edge Firewall or Web Application Firewall (WAF), you had to activate these modules in the **Main Settings** tab of each edge application. Then, criteria and behaviors were applied in the application's **Rules Engine** tab.

Azion **Edge Firewall** has evolved into an independent product including all security functionalities: DDoS Protection, Network Layer Protection, Web Application Firewall, and Edge Functions. This update facilitates the creation of new security policies that can be applied globally or specifically. Consequently, rule sets used in deprecated versions of Edge Firewall have also been deprecated.

:::note
Rule Sets deprecated from Edge Firewall show a banner with the following message: `This Edge Firewall rule set is deprecated. Please upgrade to the new version.`
:::

This documentation will guide you through updating the Edge Firewall features used in the deprecated versions to the latest ones. Each section describes how each feature works on the new modules, Network Lists, and Rules Engine.

## Creating new rules in Edge Firewall
