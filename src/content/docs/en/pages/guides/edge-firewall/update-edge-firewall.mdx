Previously, to use a rule set from Firewall or Web Application Firewall (WAF), you had to activate these modules in the **Main Settings** tab of each edge application. Then, criteria and behaviors were applied in the application's **Rules Engine** tab.

Azion **Firewall** has evolved into an independent product including all security functionalities: DDoS Protection, Network Layer Protection, Web Application Firewall, and **Functions**. This update facilitates the creation of new security policies that can be applied globally or specifically. Consequently, rule sets used in deprecated versions of **Firewall** have also been deprecated.

:::note
Rule Sets deprecated from Firewall show a banner with the following message: `This Firewall rule set is deprecated. Please upgrade to the new version.`
:::

This documentation will guide you through updating the Firewall features used in the deprecated versions to the latest ones. Each section describes how each feature works on the new modules, Network Lists, and Rules Engine.
