You can use **Device Groups** to group end-users based on their devices, operating systems, or browsers with information provided by the `User-Agent` HTTP request header. By using device groups to categorize requests, you can make your application more responsive.

The example described in this guide will group browsers through the contents of its `User-Agent` request header. For example:

```
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 16_4 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/16.4 Mobile/15E148 Safari/604.1
```

A request that carries this header was made from a mobile device, more specifically iPhone, using a Safari browser. By creating a device group that matches the words `Mobile` and `iPhone` from the header, you can configure your application to respond differently to any request that falls within this category.

To create a device group for your edge application, you'll need:

- An [Azion account](link_accounts)
- An [edge application](link_build_with_edge_app).
- An [Azion domain](link_config_domain).

You can create device groups using [Real-Time Manager](#via-rtm) or the [Azion API](#via-api).

## Via RTM

The purpose of this guide is that you create and match a new device group for mobile devices that access your application. To add a new device group through RTM:

1. [Access RTM](link_rtm).
2. On the upper-left corner of the page, open the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, and then select **Edge Application**.
3. Click the edge application to which you want to create a new device group.
4. Select the **Device Groups** tab.
5. Click the **Add Device Group** button.
6. Name your device group. The name of your device group can't contain spaces and must have only alphanumeric characters. For example: `Mobile`.
7. In the **User Agent** field, specify a regular expression that will meet the desired criteria. For example: `(Mobile|iPhone|Android)`.
8. Click the **Save** button.

:::caution[warning]
The procedure described below is a temporary solution to check the validity of your device group. Once tests have been successfully made, you should deactivate the rule.
:::

Now that your device group is set, you can use **Rules Engine** to determine what action must be taken if the expression is matched to a `User-Agent` header. In this case, a custom `Device-Is` header will be received in the response:

1. Navigate to the **Rules Engine** tab.
2. Click **Add Rule** > select **Response Phase**.
3. Give your rule a name. For example: `Device Group: Mobile`.
4. In the **Criteria** section, select the variable `${device_group}`.
5. Select the operator **is equal**.
6. Add the name of the device group as configured in the previous instructions. For example: `Mobile`.
7. In the **Behavior** section, select the behavior **Add Response Header**.
8. As an argument, add `Device-Is: Mobile device`.
9. Click the **Save** button.
10. Wait a few minutes for the changes to propagate through the edge.

If your current browser sends a `User-Agent` header similar to the example, you can test whether the request went through by accessing your application from a mobile device. If it doesn't, you can make a Client URL (cURL) request from your terminal and artificially add the header and its value using the following command:

```bash
curl -I https://xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/ -H "User-Agent: iPhone Android"
```

You should receive a list of headers including the custom header added by the rule: `device-is: Mobile device`.

Now that you've verified that the devices are being correctly categorized, you can customize the desired behavior using the same rule.

## Via API

This section contains a sequence of cURL commands you can run in a command terminal or in an API platform of your choosing.

Before you run the Azion API, you'll need to [generate a personal token](link_personal_token) for your account. You also need to [retrieve your edge application ID](link_configure_edge_app) to run the following requests.

With your token and edge application ID in hand, follow the steps to create a new origin via API:

1. Run the following `POST` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your personal token and the `<edge_application_id>` variable with the `id` of your edge application:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_applications/<edge_application_id>/device_groups' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--data '{
    "name": "Mobile",
    "user_agent": "(Mobile|iPhone|Android)"
}'
```

  | Key | Description |
  | --- | --- |
  | `name` | The name of the device group. Must be alphanumeric. |
  | `user_agent` | The regular expression that should be matched to the contents of the `User-Agent` header from the request. |

2. You'll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
    "results": {
        "id": <device_group_id>,
        "name": "Mobile",
        "user_agent": "(Mobile|iPhone|Android)"
    }
}
```

:::caution[warning]
The procedure described below is a temporary solution to check the validity of your device group. Once tests have been successfully made, you should deactivate or modify the rule.
:::

Now, to create a response that will be triggered by the device group using **Rules Engine**:

1. Run the following `POST` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your personal token, the `<edge_application_id>` variable with the `id` of your edge application, and the `input_value` variable with the name of your device group:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_applications/<edge_application_id>/rules_engine/response/rules' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--data '{
    "name": "DG - Mobile",
    "behaviors": [
        {
            "name": "add_response_header",
            "target": "Device-Is: Mobile device"
        }
    ],
    "criteria": [
        [
            {
                "variable": "${device_group}",
                "operator": "is_equal",
                "conditional": "if",
                "input_value": "Mobile"
            }
        ]
    ]
}'
```

2. You'll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
    "results": {
        "id": <rule_id>,
        "name": "DG - Mobile",
        "phase": "response",
        "behaviors": [
            {
                "name": "add_response_header",
                "target": "Device-Is: Mobile device"
            }
        ],
        "criteria": [
            [
                {
                    "variable": "${device_group}",
                    "operator": "is_equal",
                    "conditional": "if",
                    "input_value": "Mobile"
                }
            ]
        ],
        "is_active": true,
        "order": 3,
        "description": ""
    },
}
```

3. Wait a few minutes for the changes to propagate to the edge nodes.
4. Run the following cURL request manipulating the `User-Agent` header to match the device group:

```bash
curl -I https://the9ht2nvz.map.azionedge.net/ -H "User-Agent: Android"
```

5. If you receive a response similar to the following, your device group has been successfully categorized:

```bash
HTTP/2 200 
content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
content-length: 9593
device-is: Mobile device
```

You may now deactivate the rule or create a different rule to fit the application's settings to your needs.
