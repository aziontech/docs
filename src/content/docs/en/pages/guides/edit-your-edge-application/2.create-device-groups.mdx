You can use **Device Groups** to group end-users based on their devices, operating systems, or browsers with information provided by the `User-Agent` HTTP header.

## Create and activate a device group

To create a device group for your edge application, you'll need:

- An [Azion account](link_accounts)
- An [edge application](link_build_with_edge_app).

You can manage device groups using [Real-Time Manager](#via-rtm) or the [Azion API](#via-api).

### Via RTM

> If you don't have a domain configured, [create one first](link_config_domain).

To configure your origins through RTM:

1. [Access RTM](link_rtm).
