When you create an edge application with Azion, you have to set an origin, which can be an application, a web server, or a storage. When you [created an edge application](link_build_with_edge_app) or [used a template](link_templates), you defined a default origin. In this guide, you'll create and activate a new origin, with a brand new `Host` header, path, protocol policy, and origin address.

To modify your application's origins, you'll need:

- An [Azion account](link_accounts)
- An [edge application](link_build_with_edge_app).

You can choose to modify your origins using [Real-Time Manager](#via-rtm) or the [Azion API](#via-api).

## Via RTM

In this section, you will add a new origin to your application. You won't modify default origin will not be modified, 

> If you don't have a domain configured, [create one first](link_config_domain).

To configure your origins through RTM:

1. [Access RTM](link_rtm).
2. On the upper-left corner of the page, open the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, and then select **Edge Application**.
3. Click the edge application you want to configure a new origin.
4. Select the **Origins** tab.

From this screen, you'll see a list of origins for your application. A default origin must already exist in the list. To edit an existing origin, you can click the origin from the list.

The following steps will help you create and activate a new origin using the [IANA](https://iana.org) as an example. The goal is for when users access your domain through the Azion address `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/iana`, the content from the path `/iana` is retrieved from the `iana.org/about` address.

For now, start by adding a new origin to your application:

1. In the **Origins** tab, click the **Add Origin** button.
2. Give your new origin a name.

The next sections will cover some choices you can make when creating a new origin. For more information on all available options check the [Origins documentation](link_origins).

### Origin type

To define the type of origin being added:

3. Under **Origin Type**, keep the option **Single Origin** selected.

You can also choose the option **Load Balancer** if you have this product active in your account. For an in-depth look at load balancing, check [Work with multiple origins](link_lb_guide).

### Host header

To specify a value for the `Host` header sent to the origin:

4. Under **Host Header**, add `customheader.com`.

This header is used to identify the particular application on the server that contains the required content. The default value is `${host}`, which takes the host from the URL of the request.

### Origin path

To set a new origin path:

5. Under **Origin Path**, add the path `/about`.

This path will be appended to the origin address. You may add multiple layers to the path if needed.

### Origin protocol policy

To enforce a specific origin connection protocol:

6. Under **Origin Protocol Policy**, select **Enforce HTTPS**.

This will enforce an HTTPS connection with the origin, not affecting the protocol from the user request.

### Address

Finally, to define the new origin address:

7. Under **Address**, add `iana.org`.
8. Click the **Save** button.

:::note
If your origin is under a host followed by a path, for example `https://bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/applications/your-app`, do not add the full address into the **Address** field. Instead, you should add only the host, `bucket.s3.amazonaws.com` and add the path `/applications/your-app` to the **Origin path** field described above.
:::

### Activate the new origin

Now it's time to define what will trigger requests to be sent to the new origin. For this, you can use your edge application's **Rules Engine**. hat requests to the `/azionblog` URI will show content from the `azion.com/en/blog`.
