When you create an edge application with Azion, you have to set an origin, which can be an application, a web server, or a storage. When you [created an edge application](link_build_with_edge_app) or [used a template](link_templates), you defined a default origin. In this guide, you'll create and activate a new origin, with a brand new `Host` header, path, protocol policy, and origin address.

To modify your application's origins, you'll need:

- An [Azion account](link_accounts)
- An [edge application](link_build_with_edge_app).

You can choose to modify your origins using [Real-Time Manager](#via-rtm) or the [Azion API](#via-api).

## Via RTM

In this section, you will add a new origin to your application. You won't modify default origin will not be modified, 

> If you don't have a domain configured, [create one first](link_config_domain).

To configure your origins through RTM:

1. [Access RTM](link_rtm).
2. On the upper-left corner of the page, open the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, and then select **Edge Application**.
3. Click the edge application you want to configure a new origin.
4. Select the **Origins** tab.

From this screen, you'll see a list of origins for your application. A default origin must already exist in the list. To edit an existing origin, you can click the origin from the list. 

### Create a new origin

The following steps will help you create and activate a new origin using the [Azion blog](https://azion.com/en/blog) as an example. The goal is for when users access your domain through the Azion domain `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/example`, the content from that URI is retrieved from the `azion.com/en/blog` address.

For now, start by adding a new origin to your application:

1. In the **Origins** tab, click the **Add Origin** button.
2. Give your new origin a name.

### Origin type

3. Under **Origin Type**, keep the option **Single Origin** selected.
> You can also choose the option **Load Balancer** if you have this product active in your account. For an in-depth look at load balancing, check [Work with multiple origins](link_lb_guide).

### Host header

4. Under **Host Header**, add `customheader.com`.
> This option modifies the information your origin receives in the request within the `Host` header. This header is used to identify the particular application on the server that contains the required content.

### Origin path

5. Under **Origin Path**, add the path `xxx`.

### Origin protocol policy

6. Under **Origin Protocol Policy**, select **Enforce HTTPS**.

### Address

7. Under **Address**, add `xxx`.
8. Finally, click the **Save** button.


### Activate a new origin

Now it's time to define that requests to the `/azionblog` URI will show content from the `azion.com/en/blog`.
