Once you create an edge application with Azion, you have a range of configurations you can modify. This guide will pick up where you left off when you [created an edge application](link_build_with_edge_app) or [used a template](link_templates). In this guide, you'll learn to modify the protocols, delivery ports, and the encryption type that your application uses to interface with your end-users.

## Customize edge application delivery

To modify your application's delivery settings, you'll need:

- An [Azion account](link_accounts).
- An [edge application](link_build_with_edge_app).

You can choose to configure your application using [Real-Time Manager](#real-time-manager) or the [Azion API](#api).

### Real-Time Manager

In this section, you will modify some configurations of your application. You can see if the changes ocurred by accessing your Azion address.

> If you don't have a domain configured, [create one first](link_config_domain).

1. [Access RTM](link_rtm).
2. On the upper-left corner of the page, open the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, and then select **Edge Application**.
3. Click the edge application you want to configure. From this screen, you can alter the application's name, delivery settings, and which modules it uses.

The following steps will guide you through editing an edge application's settings. These instructions pick up where you left off from [creating an edge application](link_build_with_edge_app), but you can modify these settings to fit your needs.

#### Main settings

First, enable the HTTPS protocol:

1. Go to the **Main Settings** tab.
2. Under **Delivery Protocol**, switch to **HTTP & HTTPS**.
3. Click the **Save** button.

Now you can access your edge application using the HTTPS protocol. Try it out: access the `https://xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net` address. You should still see the configured application, only now the request was made using a more secure protocol.

:::note
HTTPS applications require a digital certificate. Your Azion domain is automatically protected by the Azion SAN certificate, but if you wish to [customize your domain](link_configure_domain), you'll need a [custom certificate](link_custom_certificate) as well.
:::

Next, to customize the delivery ports:

1. Go to the **Main Settings** tab.
2. Under **Ports HTTP**, in addition to port `80`, select port `8008`.
3. Under **Ports HTTPS**, in addition to port `443`, select port `8443`.
4. Click the **Save** button.

Wait a few minutes for the changes to propagate to the edge and try to access your application using one of the new ports; for example, navigate to `https://xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net:8443`. You should see your application as usual, only now under a different HTTP port.

Last but not least, customize your TLS cipher suite and edit the minimum TLS version by doing the following:

1. Go to the **Main Settings** tab.
2. Under **Minimum TLS version**, select **TLS 1.2**.
3. Under **Supported Ciphers list**, select **TLSv1.2_2021**.
4. Click the **Save** button.

Once again, it may take some time to propagate your changes to the edge. To verify whether your changes took place, you can inspect the page using your browser and locate the security settings of the application. You can also [run the DIG command](link_dig_command) to get more information on your security settings.

The application may still be running in TLS 1.3, since you selected the minimim version and not the exact TLS version, however you can check the cipher suite being used against the [list of supported ciphers](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/edge-application/#ciphers).

#### Modules

Modules can unlock additional functionalities and features for your applications. See the [Pricing page](link_pricing) for more information on how they are priced. 

For now, you'll enable two modules. The modules **Application Acceleration** and **Edge Functions** will be used for when you [tune your cache settings](link_cache_settings), [instantiate an edge function](link_functions) and [work with Rules Engine](link_rules). If you are an [Account owner](link_account_types), start by enabling them for your account:

1. [Access RTM](link_rtm).
2. On the top-right corner, click the **Profile menu**.
3. Select **Billing & Subscriptions**.
4. Navigate to the **Subscriptions** tab.
5. Enable **Application Acceleration** and **Edge Functions**.
6. Click the **Save** button.

:::note[Optional]
You may also take this chance to update your payment method on the **Payment Methods** tab.
:::

To enable the modules for your application:

1. [Access RTM](link_rtm).
2. On the upper-left corner of the page, open the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, and then select **Edge Application**.
3. Click the edge application you want to configure.
4. Enable the modules **Application Acceleration** and **Edge Functions**.
5. Click the **Save** button.

### API

This section contains a sequence of Client URL (cURL) commands you can run in a command terminal or in an API platform of your choosing. 

Before you run the Azion API, you'll need to [generate a personal token](link_personal_token) for your account.

With your credentials in hand, follow the steps to create an Azion domain via API:

1. Run the following `GET` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your personal token, to retrieve your `<edge_application_id>`:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_applications \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
```

2. You'll receive a response with all your existing edge applications. Copy the value of the `<edge_application_id>` that you want to configure.
3. Now run a `PATCH` request to modify the application as follows:

```bash
curl --location --request PATCH 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_applications/<edge_application_id>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--data '{
    "delivery_protocol": "http,https",
    "http_port": [80, 8008],
    "https_port": [443, 8443],
    "minimum_tls_version": "tls_1_2",
    "supported_ciphers": "TLSv1.2_2021",
    "edge_functions": true,
    "application_acceleration": true
}'
```

:::note
The configurations changed for this application were:
- HTTPS protocol support.
- Added custom HTTP and HTTPS ports.
- Set minimum TLS to version 1.2.
- Set supported cipher suite to TLSv1.2_2021. See full list of [list of supported ciphers](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/edge-application/#ciphers).
- Enabled the **Edge Functions** and **Application Acceleration** modules.
:::

4. You'll receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
    "results": {
        "id": <edge_application_id>,
        "name": "HTTPbin.org",
        "delivery_protocol": "http,https",
        "http_port": [
            80,
            8008
        ],
        "https_port": [
            443,
            8443
        ],
        "minimum_tls_version": "tls_1_2",
        "active": true,
        "debug_rules": false,
        "http3": false,
        "websocket": false,
        "supported_ciphers": "TLSv1.2_2021",
        "application_acceleration": true,
        "caching": true,
        "device_detection": false,
        "edge_firewall": false,
        "edge_functions": true,
        "image_optimization": false,
        "l2_caching": false,
        "load_balancer": false,
        "raw_logs": false,
        "web_application_firewall": false
    }
}
```

5. Wait a few minutes for the changes to propagate.
6. Test your changes by accessing your application using the new protocol and ports. For example, try using a browser to access `https://xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net:8443` and inspect the page.
7. Check the supported cipher suite by inspecting the page or [running the DIG command](link_dig_command).
