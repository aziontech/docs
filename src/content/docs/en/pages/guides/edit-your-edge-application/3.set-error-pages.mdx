Configure your edge application to handle error status from the origin by determining a custom path, delivering another code in the response, and determining a cache TTL for error pages.

To modify your application's error responses, you need:

- An [Azion account](link_accounts).
- An [edge application](link_build_with_edge_app).
- An [Azion domain](link_config_domain).
- A [configured origin](link_work_orig).

Use [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](#via-rtm) to configure your error responses.

## Via RTM

In this section, you'll modify your **Default Error Response** by determining a cache TTL for every error received from the origin, as well as specifying custom error responses, cache TTL, and pages.

To customize error responses:

1. [Access RTM](link_rtm).
2. On the upper-left corner of the page, open the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, and select **Edge Application**.
3. Click the edge application you want to configure.
4. Select the **Error Responses** tab.

In the **Error Responses** section, the **Status Code** field cannot be modified. This field represents every error status code received from the origin. The **Error Caching TTL (seconds)** field below it allows you to customize the cache TTL for every status code received:

5. Under **Error Caching TTL (seconds)**, set the cache *time-to-live* (TTL), in seconds, of all error pages.

To customize settings for specific error codes received:

6. Click the **+** button.
7. In the new **Status Code** field, select the status code you want to customize.
8. Add a cache TTL in the **Error Caching TTL (seconds)** field.

The next modifications are optional. You can determine a specific path from your origin that will be delivered to the user and a custom status code in the response:

9. In the **URI** field, you can add a *path* to an error page created in the source.
10. In the **Custom Status Code** field, you can customize the HTTP status that will be received by the user.
11. In the **Origin** section, select the origin of error page URIs.
12. Click the **Save** button.

When errors are received from the origin, your edge application will cache and display the error page based on the new configuration.
