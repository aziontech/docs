The Azion **Conditional Access by IP Address** policy allows you to create lists that allow access to your resources based on specific IP addresses. You can define particular IP addresses to enforce the policy, ensuring that only devices accessing from these addresses can reach the platform. This way, access from any IP address not on the organization's allowlist should be blocked when this policy is enabled.

This guide explains configuring and managing conditional access by IP address policy through Azion's platform.

:::note
When an organization sets up a conditional access by IP address policy, it applies to all account levels.

This policy is available to customers with **Enterprise** and **Mission Critical** [Service Plans](https://www.azion.com/en/professional-services/).

## Configuring a conditional access by IP address policy

:::note
To configure a conditional access by IP address policy, you must be **Account Owner** or have *managing policies* privileges. If you aren't an **Account Owner** or have these privileges, the system returns an Error 403.

Currently, an account can have only *1 configuration for this policy*, containing up to 200 rules. The IP Addresses can be either IPv4 or IPv6.
:::

1. Run the following `POST` request in your terminal, replacing `[Token]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) to configure your policy.

```bash 
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.azion.com/v4/auth/policies \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: [Token] ' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "name": "My Policy",
  "active": true,
  "rules": [
    {
      "name": "My policy rule",
      "effect": "allow",
      "resource": "platform",
      "actions": ["access"],
      "condition": {
        "ip_address": [
          "19.34.213.23",
          "132.33.16.1/24"
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}'
```

Where:

| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | ----------- | ----------- |
| name | String | Refers to the name of the conditional access policy. Up to *255 characters*. |
| active | Boolean | Indicates whether the policy is active. Accepted values: `true` and `false`. |
| rules | Array of objects | Includes an array of rules that define the policy's behavior. |
| name | String | In the rules' array, refers to the name of the individual rule. Up to *255 characters*. |
| effect | String | Refers to the rule's effect. Accepted values: `allow` and `deny`. |
| resource | String | Specifies the resource or resources to which the rule applies, either as an exact URN or a pattern match. **Note**: this endpoint includes the specific case of `platform` as a resource, which is exclusively used to define global actions for the platform. Accepted value: `.*` (matches all resources).|
| actions | Array of strings | Specifies the action or actions to which the rule applies. Accepted values: `create`, `retrieve`, `update`, and `destroy`. **Note**: when using `platform` as the resource, the only accepted action is `access`. |
| condition | Text | Defines the conditions under which the rule applies. |
| ip_address | Array of strings | Includes an array of IP addresses that are evaluated by the condition. **Note**: mandatory field if using `platform` as the resource. |

2. You'll receive a response similar to the following:

```bash
{
  "state": "executed",
  "data": {
    "id": 0,
    "name": "My Policy",
    "last_editor": "my_username",
    "last_modified": "2025-02-24T14:15:22Z",
    "active": true,
    "rules": [
      {
        "name": "My policy Rule",
        "effect": "allow",
        "resource": "platform",
        "actions": ["access"],
        "condition": {
          "ip_address": [
             "19.34.213.23",
          "132.33.16.1/24"
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Where `state` refers to the status of the policy's creation and `id` is the unique identifier of the policy. 

Done. You've configured conditional access by IP address policy and it's active. Once the policy is enabled, any user attempting to access the platform from an IP address not on the organization's allowlist will receive an HTTP 403 status.

All the access attempts, both successful and unsuccessful for valid users for the account, are logged in the **Activity History** for auditing and monitoring purposes.

:::note
This policy includes a carefully considered exception for the Account Owner, balanced with additional robust security measures. This approach ensures strong security while preventing potential account lockouts due to IP or policy changes.

## Updating the status of a conditional access by IP address policy

1. Run the following `GET` request in your terminal, replacing `[Token]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) to list all your configured account policies.

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.azion.com/v4/auth/policies \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: [Token]'
```

2. You'll receive a response similar to the following:

```bash
{
  "count": 123,
  "results": [
    {
      "id": 0,
      "name": "My policy",
      "last_editor": "my_username",
      "last_modified": "2025-02-24T14:15:22Z",
      "active": true,
      "rules": [
        {
          "name": "My policy rule",
          "effect": "allow",
          "resource": "platform",
          "actions": ["access"],
          "condition": {
            "ip_address": [
              "19.34.213.23",
              "132.33.16.1/24"
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

3. Copy the `id` of the policy you want to update. 
4. Run the following `PUT` request in your terminal, replacing `[Token]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and `<id>` with the identifier you copied in the previous step, to update the status of your policy. 

> This replaces all policy rules with the new data provided.

```bash
curl --request PUT \
  --url https://api.azion.com/v4/auth/policies/<id> \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: 123' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "name": "My policy",
  "active": false,
  "rules": [
    {
      "name": "My policy rule",
      "effect": "allow",
      "resource": "platform",
      "actions": ["access"],
      "condition": {
        "ip_address": [
              "19.34.213.23",
              "132.33.16.1/24"
            ]
      }
    }
  ]
}'
```

In this example, using `"active": false` will disable the active rule. 

:::tip
Alternatively, you can use a `PATCH` request to partially update a policy, adjusting one or more fields of an existing policy without affecting other fields.

5. You'll receive a response similar to the following:

```bash
{
  "state": "executed",
  "data": {
    "id": 0,
    "name": "My Policy",
    "last_editor": "my_username",
    "last_modified": "2025-02-24T14:15:22Z",
    "active": false,
    "rules": [
      {
        "name": "My policy Rule",
        "effect": "allow",
        "resource": "platform",
        "actions": ["access"],
        "condition": {
          "ip_address": [
            "19.34.213.23",
            "132.33.16.1/24"
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

    "id": 0,
    "name": "My policy",
    "last_editor": "my_username",
    "last_modified": "2025-02-24T14:15:22Z",
    "active": true,
    "rules": [
      {
        "name": "My policy rule",
        "effect": "allow",
        "resource": "platform",
        "actions": ["access"],
        "condition": {
            "ip_address": [
              "19.34.213.23",
              "132.33.16.1/24"
            ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Done. Your policy was deleted from your account.
