4. **Account menu**: it's on the upper-right corner. There, you can see and update information related to your account.

This block will guide you through the initial steps to [building an edge application with an Azion template](/en/documentation/products/start-with-a-template/) that best suits your needs.

6. Next to this section, there are two blocks:
- **Manage your Domains**: use this block to visit the [Domains](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/domains/) page. There, you'll be able to manage and add domains to your applications.
- **View Edge Application Metrics**: there, you'll find insights based on your applications' performance, availability, and security. This link will take you to [Real-Time Metrics](/en/documentation/products/real-time-metrics/).

7. **Invite Your Team** section: this is an optional step but if you're constantly working with a team, inviting them can help you through configurations and the entire working process. Find out more about [Teams Permissions](/en/documentation/products/accounts/teams-permissions/).

8. **Build, Secure, Deploy, and Observe** categories: each category will guide you through your Azion journey and help you to set up your applications. Read on to learn how you can explore them:

- **Build**: create and manage [edge applications](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/) and manage [Domains](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/domains/).
- **Secure**: secure your applications by creating an [Edge Firewall](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/), managing your [Intelligent DNS](/en/documentation/products/intelligent-dns/), and operating [Web Application Firewall](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/web-application-firewall/) rules.
- **Deploy**: use [Edge Orchestrator](/en/documentation/products/edge-orchestrator/), [Edge Services](/en/documentation/products/edge-orchestrator/edge-services/), and [Edge Nodes](/en/documentation/products/edge-orchestrator/edge-node/).
