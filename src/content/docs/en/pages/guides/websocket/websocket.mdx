The WebSocket protocol provides a way to create web applications that support bidirectional communication, in real time, between the customer and the server.

Azion supports the WebSocket protocol, through the [Application Acceleration](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/application-acceleration/) product.

To use Webscoket support in a configuration:

1. Go to the Content Delivery menu of [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. Edit the required Content Delivery configuration.
3. In the Main Settings tab, start up Application Acceleration and save the setting.
4. In the Rules Engine tab, create a new rule in Response Phase. Hereâ€™s an example.

| **Name:** | WebSocket |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Criteria:** | **if** *`${http_upgrade}`* **is equal** *websocket*<br /> **and** *`${http_connection}`* **is equal** *Upgrade* |
| **Behavior:** | **then** Bypass Cache Phase<br /> **and** Add Request Header *Upgrade: websocket*<br /> **and** Add Request *Header Connection: Upgrade*<br />
