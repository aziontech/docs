The **WebSocket** module for **Edge Application** provides a way to create web applications that support full-duplex communication, in real time, between the customer and the server.

To use Webscoket support in a configuration:

1. Access [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. Edit the required Content Delivery configuration.
3. In the **Main Settings** tab, enable the **WebSocket** module.
4. Click the **Save** button.

To enforce a WebSocket connection for the application, in the **Rules Engine** tab, create a rule in the **Response Phase** as follows:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Name | WebSocket |
| Criteria | `${http_upgrade}` **is equal** `websocket`<br />AND `${http_connection}` **is equal** `Upgrade` |
| Behavior | **Bypass Cache**<br />AND **Add Request Header** `Upgrade: websocket`<br />AND **Add Request** `Header-Connection: Upgrade`<br />
