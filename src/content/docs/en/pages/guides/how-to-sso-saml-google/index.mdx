Identity Provider (IdP) is a trusted entity that allows you to enable single sign-on to access other sites or services, such as Azion. Your users can continue using their corporate user identities without having to remember a specific password or enter credentials each time they access **Real-Time Manager (RTM)**. 

Google is an example of an Identity Provider.

> Even if you're using an IdP, it’s necessary to register all users of the account on RTM as they are synced in both RTM and IdP. An inexistent user on RTM won’t be able to log in to it.

When using an IdP, you have two protocol possibilities: Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) and OpenID Connect (OIDC).

To set up a Google custom SAML app as your account IdP for RTM, follow the next steps.

## Configuring the SAML app on Google Admin

> You need to be an administrator of the Google account to perform the following tasks.

2. Go to the upper-left corner of the page, and in the dropdown menu, select **Apps** > **Web and mobile apps**.
3. Click **Add App** > **Add custom SAML app**.
4. On the App Details page:

    - Type a name for the app you’re creating.
    - Click **Continue**.

5. On the Google *Identity Provider details* page, copy the *SSO URL* and *Entity ID* and download the Certificate. You’ll need this information on RTM.

## Configuring the Identity Provider on RTM

    - Find the box of your recently created identity provider.

    - Sign-in URL.

3. On Google Admin, access the **Service Provider Details** of the app you’ve created and provide the following information:

    - In the **ACS URL** field, paste the Assertion Consumer Service URL you’ve copied from RTM.
    - In the **Entity ID** field, paste the Service Provider's Entity ID URI you’ve copied from RTM.
    - In the **Start URL** field, paste the Sign-in URL you’ve copied from RTM (*optional field*).

## Turning on the Google custom SAML app

After setting the service provider details:

1. Go back to [Google Admin Console](https://admin.google.com).
2. Go to the upper-left corner of the page, and in the dropdown menu, select **Apps** > **Web and mobile apps**.
3. Select the SAML app you’ve just created.
4. Click **User access** and then click **On for everyone** to turn the service on for everyone in your organization. If you want to turn the app off, click **Off for everyone**.
5. Click **Save**.

## Turning on the Identity Provider on RTM

1. Back on RTM, access the [SSO Management](https://manager.azion.com/iam/sso/identity-providers) page.
2. On the box of the Identity Provider you've added, click **Activate and turn on identity Origin** and then click **Confirm**.

Now all the users of the account will be able to access RTM using Google as the Identity Provider.

> This doesn’t apply to Account Owner users.

> **Important**: when the IdP app is activated, the Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) stops being verified by RTM and starts to be authenticated by the IdP. If the account returns to RTM's SSO, it'll use the last active status of the MFA.
