## Azion Console's homepage and user interface

This section presents and describes the main components on the homepage and the general interface.

1. **Products menu**: located in the upper-left corner. It shows all the available Azion products and resources.

2. **+ Create** button: located in the right corner of the header. It allows you to create or add different resources such as domains, variables, edge functions, edge services, digital certificates, and more.

3. **Help** button: displays documentation related to the screen you're currently on and other helpful links.

:::note

5. **Account menu**: it's on the upper-right corner. There, you can see and update information related to your account.

6. The **Get Started** section includes the button **+ Create** to start using the Azion Edge Computing Platform. By clicking this button, you can go through the initial steps to build an edge application [starting with the Azion template](/en/documentation/products/use-a-template-via-azion-console/) that best suits your needs or create other resources such as domains, variables, edge functions, edge services, digital certificates, and more.

7. Next to this section, there are two blocks:
- **Manage Applications**: use this block to go to the [Edge Application](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/) page. There, you'll be able to manage and add applications' main settings, modules, and features.
- **View Analytics**: this link will take you to [Real-Time Metrics](/en/documentation/products/observe/real-time-metrics/). You'll find insights based on your applications' performance, availability, and security there.

8. Below, you'll find the shortcut to **Invite Your Team**. This is an optional step, but you can invite other people to Console to work together with you. Find out more on [Teams Permissions](/en/documentation/products/accounts/teams-permissions/).

9. Finally, you'll find helpful links to visit Azion's [documentation page](/en/documentation/), consult Azion's [API library](https://api.azion.com/), and contact the [Support team](https://tickets.azion.com/en/support/loginen/support/login).
