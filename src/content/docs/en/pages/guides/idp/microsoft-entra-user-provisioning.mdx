Enabling **Automated User Provisioning** streamlines identity and access management by automatically creating, updating, and deleting user accounts across applications based on changes in Microsoft Entra ID. These changes are reflected on Azion's platform users and teams, once the feature is enabled. The automation uses the SCIM protocol, making the provisioning process both scalable and secure.

It reduces manual work and enhances security and compliance, ensuring users have appropriate access to the resources as needed.

This guide will cover how to enable Microsoft Entra Automated User Provisioning for Azion's platform with SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management).

This feature is available to customers with **Enterprise** and **Mission Critical** [Service Plans](https://www.azion.com/en/professional-services/).

## Activating SCIM protocol usage

:::note
You need an Azion personal token to execute the following tasks. Read the documentation to [create a new personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/).

You also need to previously [configure Microsoft Entra as an Identity Provider (IdP) for Azion](/en/documentation/products/guides/sso-microsoft-entra-saml/).
:::

1. Go to your preferred API development and testing tool. For example, Postman or Swagger.
2. Run the following `GET` request, replacing [Token value] with your Azion personal token, to obtain the current status of your IdP and its identifier on Azion.

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/iam/identity_providers' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [Token value]'
```

3. You'll receive a response similar to this: 

```bash
{
  "name": "Microsoft Entra IdP",
"is_active": true,
"protocol": "SAML",
  "uuid": "1234abc4567",
  "login_url": "https://api.azion.com/v4/users/scim/<idp_uuid>/login",
"scim_integration": false,
"scim_url": null
}
```

    - `is_active` is a boolean confirming if the idP is active and `uuid` is the IdP identifier on Azion.
    - Copy the `uuid` to use it in the next steps.

:::note 
The IdP must be active and linked with the right SAML Application in the Microsoft Entra console. Check the guide on using [Microsoft Entra custom SAML app as an IdP for Azion](/en/documentation/products/guides/sso-microsoft-entra-saml/) for more details on this configuration.
:::

4. Run the following `GET` request, replacing [Token value] with your Azion personal token and the `uuid` with the identifier you got in the previous steps, to obtain more information about the IdP integration on Azion.

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/iam/identity_providers/saml2/<uuid>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [Token value]'
```

5. You'll receive a response similar to this:

```bash
{
 "uuid": "1234abc4567",
  "name": "Microsoft Entra IdP",
"is_active": true,
 "sign_in_url": "https://login.microsoftonline/123abc/saml2",
 "entity_id_url": "https://sts.windows.net/123abc/saml2",
  "login_url": "https://sso.azion.com/api/saml2v4/users/scim/<idp_uuid>/login",
  "acs_url": "https://sso.azion.com/api/saml2v4/users/scim/<idp_uuid>/login",
"signature_algorithm": "sha-256",
"scim_integration": false,
"scim_url": null
}
```

    - `scim_integration` refers to the current status of the SCIM protocol activation. In this case, `false` indicates that the protocol isn't active yet to work with the IdP.

6. Run the following `PATCH` request, replacing [Token value] with your Azion personal token and the `uuid` with the identifier you got in the previous steps, to update the status of your IdP SCIM integration.

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/iam/identity_providers/saml2/<uuid>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [Token value]'
--data '{
    "scim_integration": true
}'
```

7. You'll receive a response similar to this: 

```bash
{
 "uuid": "1234abc4567",
  "name": "Microsoft Entra IdP",
"is_active": true,
 "sign_in_url": "https://login.microsoftonline/123abc/saml2",
 "entity_id_url": "https://sts.windows.net/123abc/saml2",
  "login_url": "https://sso.azion.com/api/saml2v4/users/scim/<idp_uuid>/login",
  "acs_url": "https://sso.azion.com/api/saml2v4/users/scim/<idp_uuid>/login",
"signature_algorithm": "sha-256",
"scim_integration": true,
  "scim_url": "https://api.azion.com/v4/users/scim/<idp_uuid>/Users"
}
```

## Enabling Provisioning 

1. Access [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/).
2. Select the card of the record you created to use Microsoft Entra as IdP for Azion.
3. In the left menu, **Provisioning** in the **Manage** section.
4. In the **Provisioning mode** field, select **Automatic**.
5. In the **Admin Credentials** section:
    - In the **Tenant URL**, copy the link in the "scim_url" field you get in the previous step.
    - In **Secret Token**, enter an Account Owner personal token or a token for a user with SCIM protocol integration permissions.
6. Click **Test Connection** to test if it's working. You'll receive a message indicating the test was successful.
7. Click the **Save** button.

Now, you must map the users and groups you want to provision across the accounts, as explained in the following section.

:::note
You're able to decide if you provision just users; this way, the users will be created unlinked to any group and you must assign permissions and groups manually. Provisioning groups enables you to provision users within each group, including permissions.
:::

### Mapping users

:::note
Azion doesn't support the **Enterprise** schema provided by Microsoft Entra. Use always the default user schema.
:::

Still in the Provisioning configuration page:

1. Open the **Mappings** sections.
2. Select the "Provision Microsoft Entra ID Users".
3. In **Attribute Mappings**, just leave the following fields: **userName**, **active**, **displayName**, **namegivenName**, and **name.familyName**.
4. Delete the rest of the attributes. 

:::note
You must leave just the mentioned fields and delete the rest to avoid any mismatching between the user information on Microsoft Entra and Azion, this way, aligning both.
:::

5. Guarantee the **Enable** switch is on the **Yes** option.
6. Click **Save**.

### Mapping groups

:::note
**Groups** in Microsoft Entra are equivalent to **Teams** in Azion.
:::

Still in the Provisioning configuration page:

1. Open the **Mappings** sections.
2. Select the "Provision Microsoft Entra ID Groups".
3. Guarantee the **Enable** switch is on the **Yes** option.
4. Click **Save**.

:::note
If the **Groups** option isn't enabled, users will be created without a group or specific permissions, getting access just to unrestricted activities and features.
:::

## Provisioning users between Microsoft Entra and Azion

:::note
​​If a user receives **Account Owner** permission, the integration with Microsoft Entra will no longer work to authenticate this user. Instead, Azion's SSO-configured rules will take effect. This prevents any chance of this user from being locked out due to changes in the IdP that might remove their permissions.
:::

Once you've created your provisioning configuration and mapped users and groups, you can start the provisioning process. To do so: 

1. Access [Microsoft Entra admin center](https://entra.microsoft.com/).
2. Select the card of the record you created to use Microsoft Entra as IdP for Azion.
3. Select the **Overview** option in the menu. 

In this section, you can check the provision details about the default settings for provisioning. In this case, Microsoft Entra has a fixed interval of *40 minutes* to execute a new provisioning cycle.

### Manually provisioning users

Alternatively, you can execute a manual provisioning, if necessary. To manually execute it, still in the Provisioning configuration page:

1. Go to the **Provision on demand** option in the left menu.
2. Select the user or group you want to provision.
3. Click the **Provision** button.

To check if the provisioning was successful:

1. Access [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. On the upper-right corner of the page, select the avatar menu. This is the **Account menu**.
3. Select the **Users Management** to check if your user list has been updated.
