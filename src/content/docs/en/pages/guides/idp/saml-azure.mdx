:::caution[important]
Azion has two user interfaces: Real-Time Manager and Console, which is in *Preview* stage. Currently, Console is only available for Developer plans and new accounts. Follow the steps according to the user interface you're using.
:::

The Azure AD Identity Provider (IdP) is a trusted entity that allows you to enable single sign-on to access other sites or services, such as Azion. Your users can continue using their corporate user identities without having to remember a specific password or enter credentials each time they access Azion's platform.

When using an IdP, you have two protocol possibilities: Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) and OpenID Connect (OIDC).

To set up an Azure AD custom SAML app as your account IdP for Azion's platform, follow the next steps.

:::caution[warning]
Even if you're using an IdP, it's necessary to register all users of the account on Azion's platform as they're synced in both Azion's platform and IdP. An inexistent user on Azion's platform won't be able to log in to it.
