[Edge Functions](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-functions/) is a service of the Azion Edge Platform that allows you to program and execute serverless functions.

You can create functions for [Edge Application](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-functions-instances/) and [Edge Firewall](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/edge-functions-instances/).

To run a function, you must:

- Create your own function or use any of those already available on the [Azion Marketplace](https://marketplace.azion.com/).
- Instantiate a function in an edge application.
- Define activation triggers within [Rules Engine](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/rules-engine/).

## Creating a new edge function

To create an edge function:

1. Access [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. On the upper-left corner, under **EDGE LIBRARIES**, select **Edge Functions**.
2. Click on **Add Function**.
3. Choose a name for your function.
4. Write your code.
5. Click the **Save** button.

Check the guide on [How to build an API with Edge Functions and ChatGPT](/en/documentation/products/guides/edge-functions/api-builder/) for an example of a function you can run in your application.

## Instantiating an edge function

To demonstrate how to instantiate and run a function on an edge application, this guide will use the pre-configured **Azion - Hello World** function. To instantiate an edge function on an edge application:

1. [Access RTM](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. On the upper-left corner of the page, click the three horizontal lines to open the **Products menu**.
3. Under the section **BUILD**, select **Edge Application**.
4. Click the edge application you want to add a function.
5. Go to the **Functions** tab.
6. Click **Add Function**.
7. Name your function instance `Hello World function`.
8. Select the **Azion - Hello World** function.
9. Click the **Save** button.

## Configuring function activation criteria

1. In the same edge application, go to the **Rules Engine** tab.
2. Click **New Rule** and select **Request Phase**.
3. Give your rule a name.
4. In the **Criteria** section, select:

> If `${uri}` is equal `/hello-world`.

5. In the **Behaviors** section, choose **Run Function** > select the **Hello World function** > click **Save**. 
6. Wait a few minutes for the propagation to be completed. 

To see your instanced function, access your application using its domain and the URI set in the rule, which is in the format `xxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net/hello-world`.

Now you've successfully configured and instantiated an edge function in an edge application.
