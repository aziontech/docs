To enable the **CLI** to run on your computer, follow these steps:

> **Note**: the **Apple menu** is the small logo of the Apple Inc. company, located on the upper-left corner of your Mac computer screen.

1. Go to **Apple menu** > **System Preferences**.
2. In the **System Preferences** window, select the **Security & Privacy** section.
3. Select the **General** tab if it isn't already selected; you'll see a message indicating that the CLI can't be executed.
4. Click the **Allow Anyway** button.

> **Note**: the next time you run a CLI command, the macOS operating system will open a **confirmation window** informing you that it can't verify the **azioncli** developer.

5. Run the command below to force the confirmation window to appear:

    `azioncli --help`

6. Click the **Open** button in the confirmation window.

The `azioncli --help` command will be executed, and you won't need to repeat these procedures again. Once configured, access to the CLI will become permanent on your computer's macOS operating system.

If your computer uses another operating system, check the necessary procedures in the corresponding documentation.
