Azion **Object Storage** allows you to create buckets and integrate your object storage with your edge infrastructure. This guide covers how to create, modify, and delete a bucket using the [Azion API](https://api.azion.com).

<LinkButton link="/en/documentation/products/store/edge-storage/" label="go to Object Storage reference" severity="secondary" />

Read [How to upload and download objects from an Object Storage bucket](/en/documentation/products/guides/upload-and-download-objects-from-bucket/) to learn about object operations.

## Creating a read-only bucket via API

Run the following `POST` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and `name` with the desired bucket name to create a new read-only bucket:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azion.com/v4/storage/buckets' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--data '{
    "name": "my-bucket-ro",
    "edge_access": "read_only"
}'
```

You should receive the following response:

```json
{
  "state": "executed",
  "data": {
    "name": "my-bucket-ro",
    "edge_access": "read_only"
  }
}
```

Now you can use the bucket name to [upload and download objects](/en/documentation/products/guides/upload-and-download-objects-from-bucket/) from the bucket.

## Attributing read-write permission to bucket

Run the following `PATCH` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and `bucket_name` with the name of the bucket to attribute the read-write permission:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azion.com/v4/storage/buckets/<bucket_name>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--data '{
    "edge_access": "read_write"
}'
```

You should receive the following response:

```json
{
  "state": "executed",
  "data": {
    "name": "my-bucket-ro",
    "edge_access": "read_write"
  }
}
```

:::caution[Warning]
When a bucket is configured with **read-write permissions**, any user can access and modify its content (for example, by sending a PUT request to overwrite files). If the bucket is used as an origin for an application, this configuration may expose the content to unauthorized modifications. However, suppose the bucket is accessed through an function. In that case, the risk is managed by the logic implemented in the function code, allowing developers to enforce stricter controls over who can access or modify the data. To mitigate risks, always verify the required permissions for each use case and implement proper access controls. Read more on [Authentication and permissions](/en/documentation/products/store/edge-storage/#authentication-and-permissions).

## Removing bucket

Run the following `DELETE` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and `bucket_name` with the name of the bucket you want to delete:

```bash
curl --location --request DELETE 'https://api.azion.com/v4/storage/buckets/<bucket_name>' \
--header 'Accept: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]'
```

:::note
This operation can only be executed if the bucket is empty.
