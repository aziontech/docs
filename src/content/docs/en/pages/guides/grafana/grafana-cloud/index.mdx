:::caution[warning]
The Grafana plugin described in this guide **isn't** created or managed by Azion. It's a possible tool for users who wish to use the Grafana Cloud platform.

Azion focuses on an on-premise approach. To use the Grafana plugin created and managed by Azion, see [How to customize a dashboard with the Azion plugin on Grafana](/en/documentation/products/guides/azion-plugin-grafana/).
:::

With the [Azion GraphQL API](/en/documentation/products/graphql-api-overview/), you can visualize your data on [Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/) by using the [GraphQL Data Source](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/fifemon-graphql-datasource/) and adding queries with the available [datasets and variables](/en/documentation/products/graphql-api-features/#datasets).

---

## Requirements

To use GraphQL on Grafana Cloud, you need:

- A [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/) account on Azion.
- A [personal token](/en/documentation/products/accounts/personal-tokens/) created to authenticate your account.
- One or more [edge applications](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/) created on your account.
- [Access to Grafana](https://grafana.com/).
- [Install the GraphQL Data Source](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/fifemon-graphql-datasource/).

---

## Installing the GraphQL data source on Grafana Cloud

After you've finished setting up the Azion requirements and you have access to Grafana, follow the next steps:

1. Log in to your Grafana account.
2. Go to the [GraphQL Data Source page](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/fifemon-graphql-datasource/).
3. On the top menu, select the **Installation** tab.
4. On the **For** field, select the Grafana instance you want to install the plugin on.
5. Click the **Install plugin** button.

For more information, see Grafana's documentation on [plugin installation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/v8.4/plugins/installation/).

You can also use [CLI to install a plugin](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/v8.4/administration/cli/#plugins-commands).

If you access your instance directly through its link, go directly to the steps related to access on the left menu. If you've created an account on Grafana's website, go to the **My Account** environment and follow the next steps:

1. On the **Overview** page of your **Grafana Cloud Portal**, on the second section, you'll see the name of your stack.
2. On the **Grafana** card, click **Launch**.

Your stack opens on another page.

1. On the left-side menu, on the **Connections** dropdown menu, select **Add new connection**.
2. On the **Search** box, type `GraphQL Data Source`; it'll appear under **Data sources**.
3. Select the `GraphQL Data Source` card.
4. Click the **Create a GraphQL Data Source data source** button. A new page opens to configure your data source.

## Configuring the data source

With the GraphQL Data Source page opened on Grafana Cloud, on the **Settings** tab:

1. On **Name**, give a descriptive name to your data source.
2. Under **HTTP**:
    - On **URL**, add either `https://api.azionapi.net/metrics/graphql` or `https://api.azionapi.net/events/graphql`.
    - On **Custom HTTP Headers**, click **+ Add header** *two times*.
    - On the first **Header**, on the first field, add **Authorization**, and on the second field add your RTM personal token. It looks similar to: `Token azionfkr40c7rp75d7df21e18d5c19el8f01`
    - On the second **Header**, on the first field, add **Content-Type**, and on the second field add `application/json`.

3. Click **Save & test**. Grafana will run a quick test to see if your authentication is correct.

## Creating a dashboard

1. On the left-side menu, click on **Dashboards**. The dashboard page opens.
2. Next to the search bar, click **New** > **New dashboard** or **Import**.

If you pick **New dashboard**:

1. On the panel, select **+ Add visualization**.
2. From the data source list, select **GraphQL Data Source**.
3. On the query box, add the Azion GraphQL API query you want to use.

If you pick **Import**:

1. On the **Import dashboard** page, choose an option:
  - Upload a JSON file on the **Upload dashboard JSON file** card.
  - Upload a JSON through **Import via grafana.com**.
  - Upload a JSON through **Import via panel json**.
2. Click the **Import** or **Load** button, depending on your previous choice.

You can customize your dashboard using the right-side panel. You can change the type of chart from time series to bar chart, for example, the legends of the chart, or even the graph style. Grafana also has other features such as annotations.

See the [Data Transferred dashboard on Grafana JSON example](/en/documentation/products/real-time-metrics/data-transferred-dash/) for a ready-to-use dashboard.
