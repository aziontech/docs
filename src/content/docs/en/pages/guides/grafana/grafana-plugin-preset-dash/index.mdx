The Azion data source plugin on Grafana allows you to visualize the data from your existing applications on Azion on a Grafana dashboard. It queries data from [Real-Time Metrics](/en/documentation/products/real-time-metrics/), which uses the [GraphQL APIs](/en/documentation/products/graphql-api-overview).

With the data source plugin, you can use the pre-built Edge Application Data Transferred dashboard to view your data with minimum configuration effort.

## Requirements

To use the Azion data source, you need:

- A [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/) account on Azion.
- A [personal token](/en/documentation/products/accounts/personal-tokens/) created to authenticate your account.
- One or more [edge applications](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/) created on your account.
- [Real-Time Metrics](/en/documentation/products/real-time-metrics/) activated on your account.
- [Access to Grafana](https://grafana.com/).

## Installing the plugin on Grafana

Currently, to use the Azion data source plugin, you must install it locally and enable your account to use unsigned plugins. See the documentation on [the plugin's GitHub repository](https://github.com/aziontech/grafana-plugin#install-plugin-on-local-grafana) for a step-by-step on how to install it.

## Using the pre-built dashboard on Grafana

After installing a Grafana instance locally on your machine and authorizing the Azion plugin, open it.

Follow the next steps:

1. On the left-side menu, on the **Administration** dropdown menu, select **Plugins**.
2. On the **Search** box, type `Azion`.
3. Select the `Azion` card.
4. Click the **Create an Azion data source** button.

A new page opens to configure your data source.

On the **Settings** tab:

1. On **Name**, give a descriptive name to your data source.
2. On **Personal Token**, add the token you've created on the [Personal Tokens page on RTM](/en/documentation/products/accounts/personal-tokens/).
3. Click **Save & test**. Grafana will run a quick test to see if your authentication is correct.

On the **Dashboards** tab:

1. Select the **Data Transferred** dashboard option.
2. Click the **Import** button.

The pre-built dashboard is imported to your account. To access it:

1. On the left-side menu, click **Dashboards**.
2. Select the **Data Transferred** dashboard option from the list under **General**.

You'll automatically be able to view and analyze the Edge Application Data Transferred data from Real-Time Metrics. You can also save this dashboard as a copy on **Dashboard Settings** and edit it as you wish, without losing the original view.
