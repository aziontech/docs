**Network Layer Protection** allows the creation of **Network Lists**, to allow (*allowlists*) or disallow (*blocklists*) visitors from interacting with edge applications at Azion. 

Network Lists can be based on user's IP addresses, ASN, and geolocation addresses. They can be custom-made, considering the application scope and actual requests, or pre-made and maintained by Azion, such as the *Azion IP Tor Exit Nodes Network List*.

> Learn more about [Network Lists](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/network-layer-protection/network-lists/), [Network Layer Protection](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/network-layer-protection/), [Edge Firewall modules](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/), and the [Rules Engine for Edge Firewall](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/rules-engine/).

To create, manage, and use Network Lists, you must to complete the following steps before:

1. Create an **Edge Firewall Rule Set** with the **Network Layer Protection** module activated.
2. Create a **Network List**.
3. Associate this Network List within the Edge Firewall Rules Engine tab.

## Create an Edge Firewall Rule Set

1. Access [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com).
2. Open the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, and select **Edge Firewall**.
3. Write the Rule Set identification name on the **Edge Firewall Name** placeholder.
4. Select the domains where you want the firewall to be active and click the `>` button to move them to the **Chosen Domains** field.
5. Make sure the **Network Layer Protection** switch is enabled at the **Edge Firewall Modules** section.
6. Make sure the **Active** switch is enabled.
7. Click the **Save** button.

You can see the created Edge Firewall Rule Set from the Edge Firewall list.

### Activate the Network Layer Protection module

For already created **Edge Firewall Rule Sets**, follow the steps:

1. Access the [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com).
2. Open the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, and select **Edge Firewall**.
3. From the Edge Firewall list, select the Edge Firewall Rule Set you wish to add a Network List.
4. In the **Edge Firewall Main Settings** tab, enable the **Network Layer Protection** switch.

## Create a Network List

1. Access the [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com).
2. Open the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, and select **Network Lists**, from the **Edge Libraries** section.
    > When opening the Network Lists page, all lists created by the user and those items automatically provided by Azion will be displayed.
3. Click the **Add** button.
4. Fill in the following fields:

| Field              | Description                                                                                                                                                                |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Add Network List` | Identification name of your Network List. This name will appear in the list of options in the *Criteria* section, within the **Edge Firewall Rules Engine** configuration. |
| `Type`             | Type of the network list: <br /> `Autonomous System Number (ASN)` <br /> `Countries` <br /> `IP/CIDR`                                                                      |
| `List`             | Add the items that will make up your list here.                                                                                                                            |

For `ASN` and `IP/CIDR` list types, a typing field will be displayed. List items must be separated by line and you must write one address per line. Duplicated items will be deleted. For the `Countries` type, a selection list will be presented.

5. Click the **Save** button.

IP/CIDR type list example:

```
123.456.789.1
123.456.789.2/32
10.1.1.0/16
```

## Associate Network List with Edge Firewall Rule Set

1. Access the [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com).
2. Open the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, and select **Edge Firewall**. 
3. Select the **Edge Firewall Rule Set** you created, or configured, on the [first section](#create-an-edge-firewall-rule-set).
4. Select the **Rules Engine** tab.
5. Click the **New Rule** button.
6. Write the name and description for the rule set.
7. On the **Criteria** section, choose the *logical operator*, *variable*, *comparison operator*, and *network list name* on the dropdown menus to follow this logic:

```
[If]: [Network] [matches] [Network List identification name]
```

8. On the **Behavior** section, select `Drop (Close Without Response)`.
9. Make sure the **Active** switch is enabled.
10. Click the **Save** button.

In this example, if the conditions set by the rules are met, a *drop* will be run for the request without sending any return to the sender.
