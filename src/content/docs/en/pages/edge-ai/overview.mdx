The **Azion Edge AI** is an integrated AI solution that automatically adapts to the volume of requests and runs at the edge. It provides an ecosystem of tools to help you build and deploy AI-powered applications at the edge of the network.

With Azion's Edge Runtime, it's possible to run models of various types and advanced AI architectures. The possibilities include:

- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Visual Language Models (VLMs)
- LLM reasoning
- Embeddings
- Audio to Text
- Text to Image 
- Tool Calling

Through the use of LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), you can also train and specialize models for specific needs. By integrating your application with [Edge SQL for vector search](/en/documentation/products/store/edge-sql/vector-search/) and [Edge Functions](/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-functions/) to execute models and orchestrate AI agents, you can build complex and efficient AI-powered applications at the edge.
