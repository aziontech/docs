**Azion Edge Platform** is a robust infrastructure composed of various key components, as well as business logic and rules that allow for offering a reliable, scalable, and high-performance service.

It's designed to attend to different scenarios, involving the necessities and demands of a variety of customers in different markets.

## Platform ecosystem

Azion has developed a control panel and a set of APIs used by customers and the Azion team to manage the **Azion Edge Platform**. It runs on the edge and leverages a microservices architecture and a proprietary front-end framework, ensuring security and high availability.

By using this ecosystem, you can build and manage edge applications, domains, edge nodes, edge services, edge firewalls, data streams, and more, while observing the products and their usage in real time.

You can access it and get a simple and fast user experience through:

- [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](/en/documentation/products/getting-started/#getting-to-know-real-time-manager): it's the configuration interface. With RTM, you have access to all the products and services provided by Azion, being able to create and manage them. RTM also enables the management of provisioning, accounting, billing, and user permissions.
- [Azion CLI](/en/documentation/products/cli/): it's an open source tool that enables the management of services using a terminal. The Azion CLI is built in Go.
- [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/): it's a RESTful API based on HTTPS requests. It allows you to integrate your systems with Azion's platform and create new applications and services, as well as checking, removing, or updating existing settings.
- [Azion Terraform Provider](/en/documentation/products/terraform-provider/): Terraform communicates with the Azion APIs, so you can manage your infrastructure hosted on the Azion's platform, locally, as code.

## Platform components

### Azion Edge Network

Azion **Edge Network** is a highly distributed architecture that includes *more than 100 edge locations strategically located* inside ISPs’ (Internet Service Providers) last-mile networks and connectivity to multiple IXPs (Internet Exchange Points), private and public peerings, and tier 1 transit providers around the world. This connectivity strategy helps to deliver optimal performance, availability, and resiliency to customers.

Furthermore, each edge location has built-in tools and mechanisms to detect and mitigate any threat directly on the edge, before it reach the customer's origins.

### Azion Cells

Azion **Cells** is a serverless software framework and multi-tenant runtime environment specifically designed for edge-native applications and real-time data analysis. It provides a resilient execution environment for user-defined event-driven applications, with features such as zero cold-start time, low memory consumption, and enhanced security.

The framework provided by Azion Cells supports different programming languages, including JavaScript and WebAssembly, and it's compatible with various hardware and infrastructure setups, including workstations, micro-computers (Raspberry Pi, for example), SD-WAN routers, virtual machines (VMs), containers, and enterprise-grade bare-metal servers.

Additionally, this component offers the Azion **Cells Libraries**. These libraries provide pre-built components and utilities that simplify common tasks associated with edge-native application development, aiming to enhance productivity, minimize development efforts, and maximize code reusability.

### Azion Edge Traffic Router

Azion **Edge Traffic Router** is a software-defined distributed edge routing service. By using many purposely-built algorithms, this service understands the origin and necessities of each request to make the best network routing decisions. The Edge Traffic Router tracks deep network's conditions (such as packet retransmission, connectivity issues, and DDoS attacks) and edge node's conditions (including CPU, IO, disk usage, memory, and server error).

In other words, when a request arrives at Azion, the router detects the user or device making that request and then defines the best available edge node to handle it, taking advantage of Azion’s highly distributed architecture.

It uses a *load balancer*, to make better edge routing decisions based on the network's conditions, as well as a *BGP Collector*, to extract all routes, preferences, communities, and neighbors from partner ISPs and provides a fast response for connectivity issues and BGP route changes.

Edge Traffic Router can be easily extended to work as a multi-CDN, multi-edge, or server load balancing service. It can also be extended to use different HTTP-based interfaces and easily connect to third-party devices (such as set-top boxes and mobile apps) or other routing services.

### Azion Marketplace

Azion **Marketplace** is a digital catalog that makes it easy to find, test, and deploy edge-running software. With a wide range of solutions, you can use them to improve, compose, or customize your edge applications.

The solutions run edge functions in two ways:

- By using [Edge Firewall](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/), being solutions focused on network security, authentication, and traffic control.
- By using [Edge Application](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/), being solutions that attend to uses cases related to processing data or running services on the edge, closer to the user.

Azion also offers ready-to-deploy Templates that fit different scenarios and accelerate the deployment of new applications. To learn more, go to the [Templates documentation].

### Azion Products Catalog

Azion Products Catalog includes different products and modules based on edge computing technology, grouped into four main categories that reflect each step in the process of building and managing edge applications: **Build**, **Secure**, **Deploy**, and **Observe**.

## How Azion attends to a request

Azion takes advantage of its distributed network and decentralized infrastructure to quickly serve the requests, with low latency and less bandwidth consumption, optimizing the content delivery and enhancing user experience. 

Azion Edge Platform works, on a high-level, this way:


/// IMG high-level architecture ///

1. An end-user or device makes a *HTTP/HTTPS request* for a web service running in [Azion Edge Network](#azion-edge-network).
2. [Azion Edge Traffic Router](#azion-edge-traffic-router) defines the better path to the request and it's directed to the *closest* edge location.
- In this context, *closer* refers to the **edge node** that can serve the user request the fastest, based on a variety of factors such as geographic location, network conditions, server load, among others. 
3. Inside the **edge node**, the request is processed by multiple functional modules before sending back an appropriate response to the user. This occurs to apply all the adequate business logic, configurations, and parameters to the request. Through the [Azion products](#azion-products-catalog), customers are able to implement, control, monitor, scale, and automate resources at the edge, in real time.
- **Secure**: the request is sanitized to ensure only legitimate requests are processed and all attacks and malicious requests are thwarted. 
- **Build**: the edge applications reside and run in this module, and they treat the request, drawing cache from the edge, calling edge functions, or applying optimization settings.
  - An optional L2 cache layer can sit in between the edge node and the origin, further improving the performance and reducing origin load.
- **Load Balancer**: when the edge application communicates with the origin, it's protected from excessive load through different algorithms.
- **Deploy**: takes advantage of edge nodes and services to deploy applications and services, and deliver content.
- **Observe**: it provides detailed monitoring and logging of the behavior and performance of edge applications.
- **Orchestrate**: it extends to customer owned infrastructure.
4. The request is redirected to the origin in case the edge node hasn't an appropriate response.
5. The response is sent to the user or device.
