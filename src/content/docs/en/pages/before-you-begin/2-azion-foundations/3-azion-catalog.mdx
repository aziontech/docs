## Azion Products

The Azion products are grouped into four main categories that reflect each step in the process of building and managing edge applications, being: [Build](#build), [Secure](#secure), [Deploy](#deploy), and [Observe](#observe). Each category includes products and modules that enable you to go beyond.

### Build

**Azion Edge Platform** provides developers with new ways of building applications. By leveraging edge-native technologies and frameworks, developers can design applications that benefit from localized processing, low latency, and fault tolerance. This enables the creation of innovative and responsive applications that fit specific edge computing environments.
