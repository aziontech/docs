**Azion Edge Platform** is an [edge-native](#why-is-azion-an-edge-native-platform) and full-stack platform that simplifies building and running modern applications anywhere: on Azion's-operated network edge, remote devices, on-premises, or multi-cloud. It runs on a highly distributed network, with automatic deployment, monitoring of applications, and managing the whole CI/CD pipeline.

With Azion, you can:

- Build and deploy [edge applications](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/) that run directly on the edge of the network.
- Use [templates and integrations](/en/documentation/products/marketplace/) to speed up your deployment and test pre-built solutions.
- Create [zero trust architectures](https://www.azion.com/en/blog/first-steps-to-simplify-the-zero-trust-model-adoption/) to protect your content and applications.
- Improve your content delivery by relying in a [highly distributed network](/en/products/edge-network/).
- Define [caching rules](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-caching/), custom optimizations, and advanced configurations.
- Monitor your applications with [data in real time](/en/documentation/products/real-time-metrics/). 
- Improve your performance, with lower latency and bandwidth usage, while reducing operational costs.
- Develop with different [supported frameworks and languages](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-functions/runtime/overview/#supported-frameworks).
- Migrate your architecture and content to the edge.
- Observe [compliance laws](https://www.azion.com/en/compliance/).

## Why Azion is an edge-native platform

Azion is:

- **Based on open standards**: this way, you don't need to learn proprietary software or buy new hardware.
- **Programmable**: you can bring your own code, test new features with real data, and merge code easily into production.
- **Infrastructure interoperability**: Azion's platform supports different devices, systems, third-party platforms, and technologies. This way, your applications can run anywhere.
- **Agile**: NoOps and full control via API, CLI, Terraform, or Real-Time Manager, Azion's configuration interface. It also offers templates and integrations to speed up your deployment.
- **Flexible**: with the Pay-as-you-go model, you pay for exactly what you need and use.
- **Reliable**: Azion's global, distributed network with more than 100 edge locations provides a 100% network uptime.
- **Secure by design**: the platform is built to support zero-trust security models. It also offers AI-powered threat mitigation at the edge, and Security Response Teams, as well as multi-layer security with DDoS Protection Unmetered, real-time security updates, and SecOps automation. All without performance impact.
- **Compliant**: Azion is certified as a PCI DSS 3.2.1 Level 1 service provider and attested for SOC 2 Type II and SOC 3; all edge locations offer all the required compliances.

Azion offers a wide range of benefits, including low latency, a distributed architecture, scalability, efficiency, real-time processing and analytics, orchestration, and seamless management, among other advantages that define it as an edge-native edge platform. Azion has already been listed in the [Forrester New Wave Report for Edge Development Platforms](https://www.azion.com/en/blog/azion-listed-in-forrester-new-wave-edge-platforms/) (2021) and named a [Leader and Fast Mover in GigaOm Radar for Edge Platforms](https://www.azion.com/en/blog/azion-named-leader-fast-mover-gigaom-report/) (2023).
