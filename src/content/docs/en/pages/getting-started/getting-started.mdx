## Welcome to the Edge

You're walking the first steps to become part of a hyper-connected economy through Azion Edge platform.
On your journey with Azion, you'll find opportunities to explore and improve your projects through new technologies that are constantly being designed to unlock new possibilities.

If you're in the sign-up process, you can find more information in the [account documentation](/en/documentation/products/accounts/creating-account/).
If you're looking for more information on Edge Computing and how Azion's products engage and connect the community, take some time to explore the [blog](https://www.azion.com/en/blog) page.

Now, this documentation page will assist you in the Getting Started process. It includes getting to know Azion's configuration interface, the [Real-Time Manager](https://manager.azion.com/), building an **Edge Application** from scratch, and further setting up and connecting your newly created application to domains and traffic metrics.

## Getting to know Real-Time Manager

[Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/) is Azion’s configuration interface where you can access all the available products and their settings.

![Real-Time Manager homepage](/assets/docs/images/uploads/rtm-home.png)

From the homepage, you can see RTM's header. On the top left corner, you can find the **Products Menu**, where Azion products and their capabilities are available.

You'll also see a **Status** bar indicating how Azion's systems are operating. You can click the bar and check the status for each of the available [Edge Network's](https://www.azion.com/en/products/edge-network) locations.

Next to the **Status** bar, you can click the **Help Center** button. It'll display a series of documentations related to the screen you are currently on and other helpful links.

**Note**: Documentation related to RTM's screens in the **Help Center** may not be available for all screens at the moment.

At the top right corner, you can find the **Account Menu**, where you can see and update information related to your account.

In the *Getting Started* section, you'll find three shortcuts:

* **Build an Edge Application:** this block will guide you through the initial steps to [building your first Edge Application from scratch](#build-edge-app) with the setup that best suits your needs.
* **Manage your Domains:** use this block to visit the [Domains](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/domains/) page. There, you'll be able to manage and add domains to your applications.

  > You can create a domain with a TLS certificate granted by Azion. You can also automate domain creation using our [API - Azion Domains](https://api.azion.com/#5b0cef3f-e2b2-4119-821a-e22f1ff1365e).

* **View Edge Application Metrics:** here, you'll find insights based on your applications' performance, availability, and security. This link will take you to [Real-Time Metrics](/en/documentation/products/real-time-metrics/).

## Step 1. Build an Edge Application from scratch

Building an [Edge Application](/en/documentation/products/edge-application), which allows you to build your web applications to run on Azion's platform, is the first step to start using Azion Edge platform. This documentation assists you in every step of the journey of building an Edge Application from scratch with Azion’s platform and products.

After logging in to [RTM](https://manager.azion.com/), in the **Getting Started** section on the homepage, click **Build an Edge Application** to start creating your own applications.

> * Build with Edge Application
> * Select the setup option
> * Select a function

## BUILD

Step 1 of building your Edge Application from scratch is **Build**. You can build your application as you complete the set up presented to you. Next, you can find information about the required fields to have your Edge Application up and running.


import BuildFromScratch from "~/includes/docs_help_center/en/build-application/build/build-from-scratch/build-with-edge-application/index.md"
import SelectSetup from "~/includes/docs_help_center/en/build-application/build/build-from-scratch/select-the-setup-option/index.md"
import SelectFunction from "~/includes/docs_help_center/en/build-application/build/build-from-scratch/select-a-function/index.md"

<BuildFromScratch />
<SelectSetup />
<SelectFunction />

## Step 2. Launch an Edge Application

> * Run a Function — Next Steps
> * Fetch content from Origin — Next Steps
> * Advanced Edge Application — Next Steps

## LAUNCH

Step 2 of building your Edge Application from scratch is **Launch**. In this step, you can find a summary of your newly created application and its link. And here, you can find a set of available options to finalize your application according to your chosen settings.

import RunFunctions from "~/includes/docs_help_center/en/build-application/launch/run-a-function---next-steps/index.md"

<RunFunctions />

import FetchNextSteps from "~/includes/docs_help_center/en/build-application/launch/fetch-content-from-origin---next-steps/index.md"

<FetchNextSteps />

import AdvancedConfig from "~/includes/docs_help_center/en/build-application/launch/advanced-configuration---next-steps/index.md"

<AdvancedConfig />


Now that you have already started your journey of moving to the edge, you can explore the rest of our documentation page and find out more about our [products](/en/documentation/products), our [APIs](https://api.azion.com/), and a few [use cases](/en/documentation/use-cases) selected for you.

> Additionally, when you create your first edge application on Azion, you'll receive an email suggesting *Next Steps*. This way, you'll know some of the options to set up your applications and how to take advantage of Azion's edge platform.

## Step 3. Setting up an Edge Application

After creating an application with the [Build from scratch](#build-edge-app) process, you can customize or edit its settings anytime you want.

To see what are your current settings and edit them, log in to [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/). From the homepage, follow these steps:

1. Select the **Products Menu** on the top left corner.
2. In the **Build** section, select **Edge Application**.
3. From the list of your **Edge Applications**, choose the one you want to see or edit.

**Note**: if you don't have an **Edge Application** yet, you can go back to the homepage and follow the steps from [Build from scratch](#build-edge-app) or click the **Add application** button on the **Edge Application** page.

After selecting the **Edge Application** you'll work on, you'll be directed to a page with the following tabs:

* Main Settings
* Origins
* Device Groups
* Error Response
* Cache Settings
* Functions
* Rules Engine

The **Device Groups**, **Error Response**, and [Rules Engine](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/rules-engine/) tabs are of optional use. The **Main Settings**, **Origins**, **Cache Settings**, and [**Functions**](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-functions/) tabs need to be configured to have your **Edge Application** running.

See how to configure the mandatory tabs next:

### Main Settings

In this section, you'll define the main fields related to the delivery of your Applications: **HTTP** or **HTTP & HTTPS.** And, also, the **Minimum TLS version** and **Ports** fields need configuring.

| Field               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Delivery Protocol](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/#protocols) | Define the Delivery Protocol supported by your web application.<br /><br />HTTP: if your application only supports the HTTP protocol.<br /><br />HTTP & HTTPS: if your application supports both HTTP and HTTPS protocols.<br /><br />If you choose HTTP & HTTPS as the delivery protocols, you must enter the Minimum TLS version and set up a [Digital Certificate](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/digital-certificates/). |
| [Ports](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/#ports) | Define which ports will be used by your edge application.<br /><br />Web servers may have different standards for HTTP or HTTPS ports. Choose one or more ports that are compatible with your web application. |
| [Minimum TLS version](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/#minimum-tls-version) | Transport Layer Security (TLS) guarantees encrypted communications between a client and a web server via HTTPS. PCI standards recommend the use of TLS 1.2 or higher. Remember, if you use new versions, some older client devices or browsers won't be able to connect. |

### Origins

**Origins** is where you define your origin data, an essential piece of information on your **Edge Application**. See what's necessary for each field below.


 | Field                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Origin Type            | The following fields refer to the Single Origin type. Because you're creating a new Edge Application, [Single Origin](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/origins/) is the only option.After creating and saving a new Edge Application, you can turn [Load Balancer](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/load-balancer/) on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Address                | This field defines the address in which you run your application or origin. Define the origin address of your Edge Application in FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) format. For example, origin.azion.com, or an IP address.<br/>By default, Azion will connect to your origin through port 80, for HTTP, or 443, for HTTPS. Suppose you want to configure a different port to connect to your origin. In that case, you can use the host:port notation in this field; for example, origin.azion.com:8080. See the field below to understand options for connecting to your origin<br/>Note: you can't configure as the origin the same delivery domain used for your content delivery. The origin must have its own address.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [Origin Protocol Policy](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/load-balancer/#origin-protocol-policy) | The Origin Protocol Policy defines how Azion will connect to the origin. If you choose to preserve protocol, Azion will use the same when connecting to the origin. In the reverse proxy architecture adopted by Azion, users connect to the edge nodes via HTTP or HTTPS, and you choose how you want Azion to connect to your origin:<br/>Preserve HTTP/HTTPS protocol: it'll keep the same connection protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) and ports used by your user when accessing your content on Azion to connect to your origin.<br/>Enforce HTTP: the connection between Azion’s Edge Nodes and your origin will be through HTTP, regardless of the connection protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) and ports used by your user to access Azion’s content. With this new option, you may customize a port to your origin in the Address field different from the default port (80 for HTTP) if you wish.<br/>Enforce HTTPS: the connection between Azion’s edge nodes and your origin will be through HTTPS, regardless of the connection protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) and ports used by your user to access Azion’s content. With this new option, you may customize a port to your origin in the Address field different from the default port (443 for HTTPS) if you wish. |
| [Host Header](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/load-balancer/#host-header)            | This information is used to define which application should be accessed, enabling the origin server to distinguish among resources while servicing requests for multiple hostnames on a single IP address.<br/>Your origin uses the Host Header to identify the virtualhost and locate your content or Application. When setting up an origin in Real-Time Manager, you can customize the value that Azion must send in the host header.Use the value `${host}` in the Host Header field if your origin is configured to answer to virtualhost for the same domain that its users use to access the content on Azion. This way, you'll be instructing edge nodes to forward the same host header that is received from your visitors to their origin.<br/> If necessary, you can fill in a custom value for host header to be sent to your origin. For example, origin.domain.com. You must customize the host header if your origin is configured to respond to a virtualhost at a domain different than the one used by its users.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

### **Cache Settings**

In this section, you'll define the **cache options** for your content. There are two types of cache:


| Field                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| [Browser Cache Settings](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-caching#browser-cache-settings) | Browser Cache is the cache of your content that is stored in your users’ browsers. You can define the time-to-live (TTL) for each content. Still,  you have little autonomy to force the content to expire before the time defined as TTL, in case there is a need to change the content ahead of time.Here, you can choose between honoring or overriding cache settings. That is, the time that content should be kept in the user's browser cache.<br/>Choose between Honor Origin Cache Headers or Override Cache Settings.<br/>Use Honor Origin Cache Headers option if you want Azion to send your users the same cache control headers Received from your origin.If you choose to Override Cache Settings, you must enter the TTL in seconds, which is how long content will stay in cache. |
| [CDN Cache Settings](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-caching#cdn-cache-settings)     | Here, you define how your content is kept in cache on Azion’s Edge Nodes. In addition setting the TTL for each type of content, you'll be able to perform the Purge operation of the content in real time, whenever there is a need to delete the data stored in the cache.<br />Use the Honor Origin Cache Headers option if you want Azion to respect the cache control headers received from your origin, for managing the cache on Azion’s Edge Nodes. You can also customize the CDN Cache control by selecting the Override Cache Settings option. In this case, you must define a Maximum TTL, which is the maximum lifetime (in seconds) that the content can be cached in Azion’s Edge Nodes.                                                                                                           | 

After defining the previous information, click **Save** to finish this step.

## Step 4. Creating a new Domain associated with your Edge Application

Now that you have finished setting up your **Edge Application**, you must configure a [*Domain*](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/domains/) for it. This process is very important as you'll need to have *Domains* configured to connect your Edge Application to other Azion products.

On [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/), your main domain (example: `myapp.com`) and all your *subdomains* (example: `user.myapp.com`) must each be configured as a standalone *domain*.

To access the **Domains** configuration page, you can click on **Manage your Domains** from the **RTM** homepage. You can also find `Domains` on the **Products Menu**.

> If you have just created an **Edge Application** in the *Build from scratch* process, you can find the **Domains** page on the **What do you want to do next?** section on the **Launch** page.

On the **Domains** page, you can see all your **Edge Applications** listed. To set up a **Domain**, follow the steps below:

1. Click on **Add Domain**.
1. In **Add Configuration Name**, choose a name for your domain.
> You can use the same name as your *domain name*.
1. Select the [**Digital Certificate**](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/digital-certificates) you'll use — it can be the standard *Azion (SAN)* or any third party Digital Certificate.
1. Write all [Canonical Names (CNAMES)](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/domains#cname) your domain has.
1. If you want your users to access your application by CNAME only, activate the **CNAME Access Only** switch.
1. In **Edge Application**, select the one your **Domain** will be connected to from the dropdown list.
1. Make sure the **Active** switch is on.
1. Click the **Save** button.

### Required fields to add a certificate on Domains

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [Digital Certificate](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/digital-certificates) | The usual setup is to use Azion's certificate. If you'd like to add another certificate, go to the **Products Menu** on **RTM** and look for the Digital Certificates section.<br /><br />If you've selected HTTP & HTTPS during the creation of your Edge Application, you must select the TLS certificate that will be used to encrypt your HTTPS traffic. Azion provides the Azion (SAN) certificate that can be used for `map.azionedge.net` |
| [CNAMEs](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/domains#cname)              | Configure the list of delivery domains (CNAMEs) for your content or application. If necessary, you can use a Wildcard Domain (`*.yourdomain.com`). Example: `www.azion.com`<br /><br />List the domains you want to use as a URL for your files by hitting enter.<br /><br />Thus, you replace the address provided by Azion (for example, 10001.map.azionedge.net) with the listed domains.<br /><br />In this case, you should register the CNAMEs in your DNS service to redirect any routes of your CNAME to those indicated by Azion.<br /><br />For example, replace `www.example.com` with `10001.map.azionedge.net`. |
| CNAME Access Only  | By default, all Domain configurations are automatically assigned a domain name below map.azionedge.net<br /><br />By checking this option, you'll be configuring the **Edge Application** to deliver your content or applications only through the domains listed in the CNAME field. |
| [Edge Application](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/)   | Select the **Edge Application** you want to associate with this delivery domain. |

## Step 5. Pointing your traffic to Azion

Now that you've associated a custom *Domain Name System (DNS)* with your **Edge Application** on **RTM**, you need to configure it with your DNS provider. Your DNS provider must know where to find your application and what to return to users that access `myapp.com`.

> This process won't simply `redirect` users that access `myapp.com` to `<edge_application_id>.map.azionedge.net` but link your application to your DNS — and all CNAMES associated with it.

Or, you can rely on Azion **Intelligent DNS** to create, host, and secure your domains. Learn more about domains and how Azion [Intelligent DNS](/en/documentation/products/intelligent-dns) works.

If you choose to use a third-party *DNS provider*, such as GoDaddy, OpenDNS, Namecheap, and so on, this configuration must be completed outside Azion **RTM** interface and on your *DNS provider user panel*.

To link your application with a DNS, go to your *DNS provider user panel* and look for "*DNS Configuration*" or "*DNS Manager*".

> Configuration settings may change according to different providers.

Inside the *DNS Manager*, **add the link** to your Edge Application (`<edge_application_id>.map.azionedge.net`) on the *DNS Host Record* field.

Save it, wait a few minutes, and check to see if it works.

You can confirm the incoming traffic through [Real-Time Metrics](/en/documentation/products/real-time-metrics/).

Your application should now be accessible by typing your DNS as a URL.
