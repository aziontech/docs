This documentation will guide you on the first steps of using the **Azion API**.

## API overview

The **Azion API** is a *RESTful API* based on *HTTPS* requests, that allows users to fully interact with Azion products through API requests. The complete Azion API collection is on Postman.

Most API endpoints have the main HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`), so you can create, read, update, and delete Azion configuration instances. All changes made through the API are reflected on the [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com).

:::tip
Access the [API introduction](https://api.azion.com/#intro) documentation to find reference information about the API.

## Prerequisites

To run **Azion API** requests you need:

- **Real-Time Manager (RTM)** account.
- **API token (personal token)**.

## Make API resquests
 
Azion API documentation offers code examples to make requests with the terminal, using the curl tool, or to automate them with programming languages. 

Postman offers HTTPS request snippets for many programming languages.

Navigate to the `Example Request` to change from curl to another desired programming language (for requests automation).
