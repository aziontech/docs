This documentation will guide you on the first steps of using the **Azion API**.

## API overview

The **Azion API** is a *RESTful API* based on *HTTPS* requests, that allows users to fully interact with Azion products through API requests. Most API endpoints have the main HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`), so you can create, read, update, and delete Azion configuration instances. All changes made through the API are reflected on the [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com) web platform.

> Access the [introduction](https://api.azion.com/#intro) documentation to find reference information about the API.

## Prerequisites

To run **Azion API** requests you need:

- **Real-Time Manager (RTM)** account.
- **API token (personal token)**.

> Learn [how to create an RTM account](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/accounts/creating-account/) and how to create a [personal token](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/accounts/personal-tokens/) to use with the API.

## Make API requests with curl (and other programming languages) snippets
 
Azion API documentation offers code examples to make requests with the terminal, using the curl tool, or to automate them with programming languages. 

Postman offers HTTPS request snippets for many programming languages.

To make Azion API requests with curl:

1. Access the [Azion API documentation](https://api.azion.com).
2. On the first column, select the endpoint and method you would like to perform. For example `Tools` > `Personal Tokens` > `POST Create Personal Token`.
3. Navigate to `Example Request`.
4. Change the authorization token header with your personal token.
5. Change the request body properties with your data.

curl request stdin example:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/iam/personal_tokens' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token aziona4FbA7K7EfT4OdK3E1N641289b6346b02b4' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{   
    "name": "My personal Token created with the Azion API",
    "expires_at": "2024-01-01T00:00",
    "description": "This token was created with Azion API"
}'
```

6. Press `enter` to send.
7. The success response should look like the `Example Response`, in the method documentation.

Stdout example:

```bash
{
  "uuid": "ef1a5k4e-t7o2-k9e4-n1d8-d07567bb0a13",
  "name": "My personal Token created with the Azion API",
  "key": "aziona4FbA7K7EfT4OdK3E1N641289b6346b02b4",
  "user_id": 999,
  "created": "2023-07-06T09:41:22.777299-03:00",
  "expires_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00-03:00",
  "description": "This token was created with Azion API"
}
```

### Implement requests with programming languages

To change from curl to another desired programming language:

1. Navigate to **LANGUAGE** on the Postman UI top bar.
2. From the dropdown menu, select the desired programming language.

The code snippet from `Example Request` will change to the desired programming language request snippet.
