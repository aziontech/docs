## Zero-touch Provisionig

Zero-touch provisioning is a feature that allows you to automate file and configuration provisioning.

Previously, the deployment of a device and all its access points was a multi-step process that required involvement from multiple professionals. With the introduction of zero-touch provisioning technology, this process has been streamlined, accelerating deployment times and enhancing security.

Basic workflow for using zero-touch provisioning through Azion Edge Orchestrator:

1. [Install the Edge Orchestrator Agent](/en/documentation/products/guides/deploy/install-orchestrator-agent/) on your device. This device now represents an edge node.
2. [Authorize the node](/en/documentation/products/guides/deploy/authorize-an-edge-node/) on the Azion platform.
3. The node is now ready to be provisioned automatically.

### Deploy on premises

Zero-touch provisioning can significantly benefit on-premises nodes in several ways:

1. **Automated provisioning**: it allows for the automatic provisioning of configurations, which can significantly reduce the time and effort required to set up each node.

2. **Enhanced security**: by eliminating the need for manual configuration, it reduces the risk of human error, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.

3. **Scalability**: it makes it easier to scale your network, as new nodes can be added and configured automatically.

4. **Efficiency**: it streamlines the deployment process, accelerating deployment times and reducing the need for involvement from multiple professionals.

### Deploy on multi-cloud 

Zero-touch provisioning can significantly benefit multi-cloud environments:

1. **Automated provisioning**: in a multi-cloud environment, managing configurations across different cloud platforms can be complex. It can automate this process, reducing the time and effort required.

2. **Enhanced security**: Zero-touch provisioning eliminates the need for manual configuration, reducing the risk of human error and potential security vulnerabilities. This is especially important in a multi-cloud environment where security policies may vary across platforms.

3. **Scalability**: Zero-touch provisioning can make it easier to scale your network across multiple cloud platforms, as new nodes can be added and configured automatically.

4. **Efficiency**: it can streamline the deployment process across multiple cloud platforms, accelerating deployment times and reducing the need for involvement from multiple professionals.

5. **Consistency**: by automating the provisioning process, it can help ensure consistency in configurations across different cloud platforms.

:::note 
The specific workflow for using zero-touch provisioning in a multi-cloud environment would depend on the specific cloud platforms being used and the capabilities of the system.

### Deploy IoT

Zero-touch provisioning can be particularly beneficial for IoT (Internet of Things) devices:

1. **Automated provisioning**: IoT devices often need to be deployed in large numbers. Zero-touch provisioning can automate the configuration process, significantly reducing the time and effort required.

2. **Scalability**: as the number of IoT devices in a network grows, zero-touch provisioning makes it easier to scale, as new devices can be added and configured automatically.

3. **Security**: by eliminating the need for manual configuration, zero-touch provisioning reduces the risk of human error, which can lead to security vulnerabilities. This is especially important for IoT devices, which can often be a target for cyber-attacks.

4. **Efficiency**: zero-touch provisioning can streamline the deployment process, accelerating deployment times and reducing the need for involvement from multiple professionals.

5. **Consistency**: by automating the provisioning process, zero-touch provisioning can help ensure consistency in configurations across a large number of IoT devices.

:::note 
The specific benefits and implementation of zero-touch provisioning can vary depending on the specific IoT devices and the network they are being deployed in.
