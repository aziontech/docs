:::caution[important]
Azion has two user interfaces: Real-Time Manager and Console, which is in *Preview* stage. Currently, Console is only available for Developer plans and new accounts. Follow the steps according to the user interface you're using.
:::

During the deployment process on [Edge Orchestrator](/en/documentation/products/deploy/edge-orchestrator/), you can work with variables. A variable can be set on an [edge service](#edge-services-variables) and an [edge node](#edge-node-variables).

You can create edge node and edge services variables using:

- [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/)
- [Azion Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/)
- [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/)

:::note
The priority is always the edge node variable. So, if you have a variable configured on an edge service and the same variable configured on an edge node, the one on the node will override the one configured on the edge service.

1. Go to [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Edge Services**.
2. Select the edge service to which you want to add a variable.
3. Go to the **Variables** section.
4. Add the following variable:

```bash 
name=azion
```

5. Click the **Save** button.

Now, you've created a variable related to a specific service. You need to access this variable through a resource.

1. Navigate to the **Resources** tab. 
2. Click on **+ Resource** or select the resource to which you wish to use the variable.
3. Enter the **Path** of the resource.
4. Choose the type **Text**.
5. Add the following content to the content block: 

```bash 
I am using {{name}} edge orchestrator
```

6. Click the **Save** button.

2. Select the edge service to which you want to add a variable.
3. Go to the **Environment** tab.
4. Add the following variable:

5. Click the **Save** button.

Now, you've created a variable related to a specific service. You need to access this variable through a resource.

1. Navigate to the **Resources** tab.

<Fragment slot="panel.api">
1. Run the following `GET` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and retrieve the edge service ID to which you wish to add a variable:

```bash 
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_services/' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]'
```

2. Create a variable related to the service. Run the following `PATCH` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and informing the variable's name and value:

```bash
curl --location --request PATCH 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_services/:id' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "active": true,
  "name": "service",
  "variables": [
    {
      "name": "name",
      "value": "azion"
    }
  ]
}'
```

Now, you've created a variable related to a specific service. You need to access this variable through a resource.

3. Run the following `POST` request in your terminal:

```bash 
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_services/:id/resources' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "content_type": "Text",
  "name": "/resource",
  "content": "I am using {{name}} edge orchestrator"
}'
```

Replace `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/), `:id` with the ID of the edge service and inform the following parameters in the request body:

| Property | Description | Required | 
| - | - | - | 
| `content_type` | Content type of the resource being created | Yes |
| `name` | Name of the resource being created | Yes |
| `content` | Content that defines actions performed when the resource state changes in the edge node | Yes |

## Edge Node variables

1. Go to [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Edge Nodes**.
2. Select the edge node to which you want to add a variable.
3. Go to the **Services** tab.
4. Choose the service to which you want to apply the variable.
5. Add the following content to the variables block: 

```bash 
name=azion
```

6. Click the **Save** button.

Now, you've created a variable related to a specific node. You need to access this variable through a resource.

2. Select the service related to the resource. 
3. Click on **+ Resource** or select the resource where you wish to use the variable.
4. Enter the **Path** of the resource.

Now, you've created a variable related to a specific node. You need to access this variable through a resource.

1. Go to [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/) > **Edge Libraries** > **Edge Services** and select the service related to the resource. 
2. Select the resource where you wish to use the variable.
3. Click on **Add Resource**.
4. Enter the filepath of the resource.
5. Choose the type **Text**.
6. Add the following content to the content block:

```

7. Click the **Save** button.

<Fragment slot="panel.api">
1. Run the following `GET` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and retrieve the edge node ID to which you wish to add a variable:

```bash 
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_nodes/' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]'
```

2. Run the following `GET` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and `:id` with the ID of the edge node, and retrieve the ID of the relation between the edge node and the chosen service:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_nodes/:id/services' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]'
```

3. Run the following `PATCH` request in your terminal:

```bash 
curl --location --request PATCH 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_nodes/:node_id/services/:bind_id' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--data '{
  "variables": [
    {
      "name": "name",
      "value": "Azion"
    }
  ]
}'
```

Replace `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/), `:id` with the ID of the edge node and `:bind_id` with the ID of the relation retrieved in step 2, informing the following properties in the request body:

| Property | Description | Required | 
| - | - | - | 
| `variables` | Variables to be replaced during the processing on the edge node.  | No |

Now, your variables are created and ready to be accessed during the execution on your nodes related to the specific service. It's relevant to stress that when you have a variable with the same name configured on a service and on a node, the value stored on the node will prevail, for example:

Variable configured on the edge service: 

```bash
name=azion 
``` 

Variable configured on the edge node

```bash
name=azion2
``` 

When the resource is accessed, the value of the variable will be `azion2` instead of `azion`.

To access the resource on the edge node, you need to access the file. You can access it through the filepath you informed during the creation of the resource. 

Resource name: 

```bash
/txt/test
```

To access it: 

```bash 
nano /txt/test
```
