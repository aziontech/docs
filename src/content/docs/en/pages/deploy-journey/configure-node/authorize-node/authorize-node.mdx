If you've already installed [Azion Orchestrator Agent](/en/documentation/products/guides/deploy/install-orchestrator-agent/) on your device, the next step is to authorize the edge node on the platform. You can do so using:

- [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/)
- [Azion API](https://api.azion.com)

## Via Azion Console

1. [Access Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/).
2. On the upper-left corner of the page, open the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, and then select **Edge Nodes**.
3. Find the edge node you wish to authorize, which will have the status `Waiting Authorization`.
4. Hover the edge node and click on the icon of a key. 
5. Confirm the authorization.

## Via API 

1. Run the following `GET` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and retrieve the edge node ID you wish to authorize:

```bash 
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_nodes/' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]'
```

2. Run the following `PATCH` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and informing the edge node ID:

```bash 
curl --location --request PATCH 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_nodes/authorize' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'accept: application/json; version=3' \
--data '{
    "edge_node_ids": [
        0
    ]
}'
```

Now, your edge node is authorized and able to work with [edge services](/en/documentation/products/deploy/edge-orchestrator/edge-services/).
