To be able to install Edge Orchestrator Agent and start orchestrating, you must create your credentials. You can do so using:

- [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/)
- [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/)

---

## Via RTM 


1. Access [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. On the upper-right corner of the page, open the **Account menu**, represented by an avatar.
3. Click the **Add Credential** button.
4. Choose a name for your credential.
5. Describe how or by whom the credential will be used in the **Description** field in **Settings**.
- Example: `Credential used for Edge Nodes registration`.
6. Click the **Save** button.

A token will be generated after the credential is saved.

When clicking on the created credential on the **Credentials** page, you can:

- Copy the generated token.
- Delete your credential.
- Edit your credential. You can update your credential's *name*, *description*, and *status* (active/inactive).

---

## Via API 

1. Run the following `POST` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/), and informing the following properties in the request body:

Request body properties: 

| Property | Description | Required | 
| - | - | - | 
| `name` | Name of the credential you want to create  | Yes |
| `description` | Open field to describe your credential with information such as for what purpose it was created | No |
| `status` | Status of your credential | No  |

```bash 
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/credentials/' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "description": "credential to use with Orchestrator",
  "name": "new credential",
  "status": true
}'
```

Now you can install Edge Orchestrator agent on your node and start orchestrating your services.
