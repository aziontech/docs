To install **Edge Orchestrator Agent** and start orchestrating, you must create your credentials before. You can do so through:

- [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/)
- [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/)

---

## Via RTM 

1. Access [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/) > **Account menu**.
2. Click the **Add Credential** button.
3. Give your credential an easy-to-remember name.
4. Describe how or by whom the credential will be used in the **Description** field in **Settings**.
- Example: `Credential used for Edge Nodes registration`.
5. Click the **Save** button.

A token will be generated after the credential is saved.

When clicking on the created credential on the **Credentials** page, you can:

- Copy the generated token.
- Delete your credential.
- Edit your credential. You can update your credential's *name*, *description*, and *status* (active/inactive).

---

## Via API 

1. Run the following `POST` request in your terminal: 

```bash 
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/credentials/' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "description": "credential to use with Orchestrator",
  "name": "new credential",
  "status": true
}'
```

Replace `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and inform the following properties in the request body:

| Property | Description | Required | 
| - | - | - | 
| `name` | Name of the credential you want to create  | Yes |
| `description` | Open field to describe your credential with information such as for what purpose it was created | No |
| `status` | Status of your credential | No  |


Now you can install Edge Orchestrator agent on your node and start orchestrating your services.
