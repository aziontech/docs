Alternatively, you can download it using the command line. In the example, the download link refers to the Linux/x86_64 agent. If you want to download another version, just change the URL for the required operating system or architecture:

`curl -O http://downloads.azion.com/linux/x86_64/edge-orchestrator`

:::note
The commands executed in the edge-orchestrator agent must be executed with administrator privileges. It might be necessary to run the commands with `sudo`.
:::

After downloading, follow the steps below to install the Edge Orchestrator agent to your device:

1. Inside the directory where the binary is in, install the **Edge Orchestrator** agent:

```bash
   sudo chmod +x edge-orchestrator
```

```bash
   sudo ./edge-orchestrator install
```

2. Enter the credential for the Edge Orchestrator agent.
3. Start the **Edge Orchestrator** agent after installing it:

```bash
   sudo ./edge-orchestrator start
```

:::note
If your operating system doesn't have a service manager (such as `systemd`), you must run it in the foreground.
:::

```bash
   sudo ./edge-orchestrator start --foreground
```

:::note
The logs to run the Edge Orchestrator agent are stored in the installation directory, under `/var/log/azion/edge-orchestrator.log`
