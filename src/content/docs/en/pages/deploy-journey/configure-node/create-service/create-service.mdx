You can create an edge service by using:

- [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/)
- [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/)

---

## Via Azion Console

To create an edge service, proceed as follows:

1. Go to [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/) > **Edge Libraries** > **Edge Services**.
2. Click on the **Add Service** button.
- Your service will be created automatically.
- You can change the name of the service by clicking on **My New Service** in the name field.
3. Go to the **Resources** tab and click **Add Resource**.
4. Configure the resources you need for your service, using the triggers: **Install**, **Reload**, or **Uninstall**.
5. **Optional**: where you've used variables in the content of one or more resources, you can set the default values for them in the **Environment** tab.
- The variables must be in the format `Variable = Value`, where `Variable` has been used in the content of resources that are already registered.
6. Activate the service by enabling the switch in the bottom-left corner in the **Environment** tab.
7. Click on the **Save** button.

## Via API

1. Run the following `POST` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and informing the name of the service being created:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_services/' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "name": "string"
}'
``` 

Now, the service is available and able to be deployed onto the edge nodes.
