You can create an edge service by using:

- [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/)
- [Azion Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/)
- [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/)

To create an edge service, proceed as follows:

<Tabs client:visible>
    <Fragment slot="tab.console">Console</Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.rtm">Real-Time Manager</Fragment>
    <Fragment slot="tab.api">API</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.console">
1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) > **Edge Services**.
2. Click on the **+ Service** button.
3. Give a name for your service.
4. Define the variables, if necessary.
    - The variables must be in the format `Variable = Value`.
5. Click the **Save** button.
6. Go to the **Resources** tab and [provide resources](/en/documentation/products/guides/deploy/provision-files/) for your service.
</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.rtm">
1. Go to [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. On the top-left corner, select the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, and then **Edge Libraries** > **Edge Services**.
3. Click on the **Add Service** button.
    - Your service will be created automatically. You can change the name of the service by clicking on **My New Service** in the name bar.
4. Go to the **Resources** tab and [provide resources](/en/documentation/products/guides/deploy/provision-files/) for your service.
5. **Optional**: if you've used variables in the content of one or more resources, you can set the default values for them in the **Environment** tab.
    - The variables must be in the format `Variable = Value`, where `Variable` has been used in the content of resources that are already registered.
6. Activate the service and click on the **Save** button.
</Fragment>

<Fragment slot="panel.api">
1. Run the following `POST` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and informing the name of the service being created:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_services/' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
  "name": "string"
}'
``` 

Now, the service is available and able to be deployed onto the edge nodes.
