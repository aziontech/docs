:::caution[important]
Azion has two user interfaces: Real-Time Manager and Console, which is in *Preview* stage. Currently, Console is only available for Developer plans and new accounts. Follow the steps according to the user interface you're using.
:::

You can unbind an edge service from an edge node using:

- [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console)
- [Azion Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/)
- [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/#4eb8b626-d1a2-48a5-aa7c-77ea0b134b34)

<Fragment slot="panel.rtm">
1. Access [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. On the upper-left corner of the page, open the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, and then select **Edge Nodes**.
3. Select the edge node from which you want to unbind a service.
4. Go to the **Services** tab.

<Fragment slot="panel.api">
1. Run the following `GET` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and retrieve the edge node ID to which you wish to unbind an edge service:

```bash 
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_nodes/' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]'
```

2. Run the following `GET` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and `:id` with the ID of the edge node, and retrieve the ID of the relation between the edge node and the chosen service:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_nodes/:id/services' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]'
```

3. Run the following `DELETE` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/), `:node_id` with the ID of the edge node and `:bind_id` with the ID of the relation between edge node and edge service:

```bash
curl --location --request DELETE 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_nodes/:node_id/services/:bind_id' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]'
```

Now, your edge node doesn't have a relation with this specific edge service anymore.
