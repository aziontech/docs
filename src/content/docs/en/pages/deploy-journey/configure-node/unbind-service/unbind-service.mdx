You can unbind an edge service from an edge node using:

- [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/)
- [Azion API](https://api.azion.com/#4eb8b626-d1a2-48a5-aa7c-77ea0b134b34)

1. Access [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/).
2. On the upper-left corner of the page, open the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, and then select **Edge Nodes**.
3. Select the edge node from which you want to unbind a service.
4. Go to the **Services** tab.
5. Find the service you wish to unbind and click the trash can icon. 
6. Confirm the unbinding.

<Fragment slot="panel.api">
1. Run the following `GET` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and retrieve the edge node ID to which you wish to unbind an edge service:

```bash 
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.azion.com/v4/orchestrator/edge_nodes \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: [TOKEN VALUE]'
```

2. Run the following `GET` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and `<nodeId>` with the ID of the edge node, and retrieve the ID of the relation between the edge node and the chosen service:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.azion.com/v4/orchestrator/edge_nodes/<nodeId>/services \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: [TOKEN VALUE]'
```

1. Run the following `DELETE` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/), `<nodeId>` with the ID of the edge node and `<bindId> ` with the ID of the relation between edge node and edge service:

```bash
curl --request DELETE \
  --url https://api.azion.com/v4/orchestrator/edge_nodes/<nodeId>/services/<bindId> \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Authorization: [TOKEN VALUE]' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json'
```

Now, your edge node doesn't have a relation with this specific edge service anymore.
