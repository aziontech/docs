:::caution[important]
Azion has two user interfaces: Real-Time Manager and Console, which is in *Preview* stage. Currently, Console is only available for Developer plans and new accounts. Follow the steps according to the user interface you're using.
:::

**Edge Orchestrator** allows you to manage and control edge resources in real time, including the deployment, update, and management of various services and resources.

Azion provides two ways to manage edge nodes, edge services, and resources: 

- Via [Azion API](https://api.azion.com)
- Via interface [Azion Console](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-azion-console/) or [Azion Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/)

:::note
The creation of an edge node occurs directly on the devices when the [Edge Orchestrator Agent](/en/documentation/products/guides/deploy/install-orchestrator-agent/) is installed on them.

## Step 1: Create an edge service

To create an edge service, you need to give it an easy-to-remember name.

<LinkButton link="/en/documentation/products/guides/deploy/create-edge-service/" label="go to how to create an edge service" severity="secondary" target="_blank" />

---

## Step 2: Create a resource 

To be able to orchestrate services on your device, you need to configure all the resources needed to install, uninstall, and reload your services.

To create a resource, you need to: 

- Give the resource an easy-to-remember name.
- Choose the `content-type` of the resource. Example: `text` and `shell-script`.
- Add the content of the resource.

---

## Step 3: Generate a personal token 

To be able to manage edge nodes, you must generate a personal token.

To do so: 

- Add an easy-to-remember name.
- Add a description.
- Set the expiration data for the token.

<LinkButton link="/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/" label="go to generate a personal token" severity="secondary" />

---

## Step 4: Install Edge Orchestrator Agent 

With the personal token created, download and install the Edge Orchestrator agent:


<LinkButton link="/en/documentation/products/guides/deploy/install-orchestrator-agent/" label="go to how to install Edge Orchestrator Agent" severity="secondary" target="_blank" />

---

## Step 5: Authorize an edge node

With the Edge Orchestrator Agent installed on the device:

- Authorize the edge node.

<LinkButton link="/en/documentation/products/guides/deploy/authorize-an-edge-node/" label="go to how to authorize an edge node" severity="secondary" target="_blank" />
<br/>
<LinkButton link="/en/documentation/products/deploy/edge-orchestrator/edge-node/" label="go to Edge Node reference documentation" severity="secondary" />

---

## Step 6: Bind an edge service to an edge node

Now, with the edge node created and authorized, you must bind it with an edge service to be deployed onto the edge node.

- Create a relation between edge service and edge node.

<LinkButton link="/en/documentation/products/guides/deploy/bind-service-node/" label="how to bind an edge service to an edge node" severity="secondary" target="_blank" />

Once this relation is in place, when an update is triggered on the edge services, it'll be deployed to all nodes related to this service in particular.
