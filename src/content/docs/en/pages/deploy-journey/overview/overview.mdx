Azion **Deploy** products are designed to enhance the efficiency of managing edge resources in real time.  

## Edge Orchestrator

**Azion Edge Orchestrator** is a versatile cloud management and provisioning service, specifically engineered for edge infrastructures and applications. It empowers operators and customers to manage and control edge resources in real time, including the deployment, update, and management of various components such as:

- [Edge Services](/en/documentation/products/deploy/edge-orchestrator/edge-services/)
- [Edge Nodes](/en/documentation/products/deploy/edge-orchestrator/edge-node/)

Edge Orchestrator is adaptable to various environments, capable of running natively on the operating system, within containers, or on top of the [Azion Edge Runtime]().

An Azion Edge Orchestrator agent is installed on edge nodes and provides end-to-end encrypted remote node management from [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/).

When the Azion Orchestrator Agent is installed on a device and the device is authorized, it now represents an edge node. A service can be linked to many edge nodes. When a service is updated, it'll automatically be deployed to the edge nodes to which it's related.

### Edge Services

**Azion Edge Services** facilitates resource registration and configuration through [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/), enabling service orchestration on specified edge nodes.

It allows configuration of install, uninstall, and reload triggers, and definition of resource dependencies for edge network service execution.

### Edge Nodes

An edge node is a device that has Azion Orchestrator Agent installed with the due credentials configured and authorized on the platform.

Edge Orchestrator allows customers to manage their own edge nodes, independent of the Azion distributed network. To start provisioning applications, it's essential to configure edge nodes.

### Credentials 

**Credentials** are keys used to authenticate edge nodes.
