Azion Deploy products are designed to enhance the efficiency of managing edge resources in real-time.  

## Orchestrator

Azion Edge Orchestrator is a versatile cloud management and provisioning service, specifically engineered for edge infrastructures and applications. It empowers operators and customers to manage and control edge resources in real-time, including the deployment, updating, and management of various components such as:

- Edge nodes
- Edge services

The Orchestrator is adaptable to various environments, capable of running natively on the operating system, within containers, or on top of the [Azion Edge Runtime]().

When Azion Orchestrator Agent is installed on a device and the device is authorized, it now represents an Edge Node. A service can be linked to many Edge Nodes. When a service is updated, it will automatically be delivered to the Edge Nodes it has a relation with.

### Edge Services

An Edge Service allows customers to provision their custom services on any device supported by the Edge Orchestrator.

### Edge Nodes

With Edge Orchestrator, customers manage their own edge nodes, independent of the Azion distributed network. To start provisioning applications, it's essential to configure the edge nodes.
