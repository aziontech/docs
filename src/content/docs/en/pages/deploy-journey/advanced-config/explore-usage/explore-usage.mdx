**Azion Orchestrator** works based on an agent. This agent is installed on your device, making your device, from this moment on, an edge node that [must be authorized](/en/documentation/products/guides/deploy/authorize-an-edge-node/) before starting the orchestration.

[Azion Orchestrator Agent](/en/documentation/products/guides/deploy/install-orchestrator-agent/) presents a list of commands that can be run in the terminal and help you use its features.

The list of commands includes: 

- Install and uninstall.
- Help with general commands.
- Status of the execution of the agent.

You can [check logs](/en/documentation/products/guides/deploy/watch-logs/) related to the edge nodes execution by accessing the file `/var/log/azion/edge-orchestrator.log` and edge services logs in `/var/log/azion/edge-services.log`.
