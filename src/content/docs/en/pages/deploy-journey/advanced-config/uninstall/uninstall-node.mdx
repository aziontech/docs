## Uninstalling agent 

To uninstall Azion Edge Orchestrator Agent: 

1. Access your device from which you want to remove the agent. 
2. Open the terminal and go to the folder where the agent is installed. 
3. Run: 

```bash
sudo ./edge-orchestrator uninstall 
```

Output: 

```bash 
Edge Orchestrator was uninstalled successfully
```

From this moment on, your node won't receive updates anymore.

:::note 
Uninstalling the agent from your device doesn't remove the node from the list of nodes. To complete the process, you need to delete your node from the list of available edge nodes.

:::caution 
Once an edge node is deleted, it can't be recovered.
