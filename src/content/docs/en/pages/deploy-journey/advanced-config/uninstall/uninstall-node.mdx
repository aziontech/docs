## Uninstalling agent 

To uninstall Azion Edge Orchestrator Agent: 

1. Access your device from which you want to remove the agent. 
2. Open the terminal and go to the folder where the agent is installed. 
3. Run: 

```bash
sudo ./edge-orchestrator uninstall 
```

Output: 

```bash 
Edge Orchestrator was uninstalled successfully
```

From this moment on, your node won't receive updates anymore.

:::note 
Uninstalling the agent from your device doesn't remove the node from the list of nodes. To complete the process, you need to delete your node from the list of available edge nodes.

## Deleting edge node


:::caution 
Once an edge node is deleted, it can't be recovered.
::: 

### Via RTM 

1. [Access RTM](/en/documentation/products/guides/access-rtm/).
2. On the upper-left corner of the page, open the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, and then select **Edge Nodes**.
3. Find the edge node you wish to remove.
4. Hover the edge node and click on the icon of a trash can. 
5. Confirm the deletion by entenring the word `delete`. 

### Via API 

1. Run the following `GET` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and retrieve the edge node ID you wish to delete:

```bash 
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_nodes/' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]'
```

2. Run the following `DELETE` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/) and `:id` with the edge node ID:

```bash 
curl --location --request DELETE 'https://api.azionapi.net/edge_nodes/:id' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]'
```

:::tip
Check the [Azion API documentation](https://api.azion.com/) and the [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/aziontech/azionapi-openapi/) to know more about all features available via API.
