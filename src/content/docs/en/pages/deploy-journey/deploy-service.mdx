**Edge Orchestrator** allows you to manage and control edge resources in real time, including the deployment, update, and management of various services and resources.

Azion provides two ways to manage edge nodes, edge services, resources, and credentials: 

- [Azion API](https://api.azion.com)
- [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](/en/documentation/products/guides/how-to-access-rtm/)

## Step 1: Create an edge service

To create an edge service, you need to give it an easy-to-remember name.

<Button href="/en/documentation/products/guides/deploy/create-edge-service/" text="go to create an edge service guide" variant="secondary"></Button>

---

## Step 2: Create a resource 

To be able to orchestrate services on your device, you need to configure all the resources needed to install, uninstall, and reload your services.

To create a resource, you need to: 

- Give the resource an easy-to-remember name.
- Choose the `content-type` of the resource. Example: `text` and `shell-script`.
- Add the content of the resource.

## Step 3: Generate a credential 

To be able to manage edge nodes, you must generate the credentials used by the Azion Orchestrator Agent.

To do so: 

- Choose a description.
- Add an easy-to-remember name.
- Set the credential as active.

<Button href="/en/documentation/products/guides/deploy/create-credentials/" text="go to create a credential guide" variant="secondary"></Button>
<br/>
<Button href="/en/documentation/products/deploy/credentials/" text="go to credentials reference documentation" variant="secondary"></Button>

---

## Step 4: Install Edge Orchestrator Agent 

With the credentials created:

- Download and install the Edge Orchestrator agent with the recently created credentials.

<Button href="/en/documentation/products/guides/deploy/install-orchestrator-agent/" text="go to Install Edge Orchestrator Agent guide" variant="secondary"></Button>

---

## Step 5: Authorize an edge node

With the Edge Orchestrator Agent installed on the device:

- Authorize the edge node.

<Button href="/en/documentation/products/guides/deploy/authorize-node/" text="go to authorize edge node guide" variant="secondary"></Button>
<br/>
<Button href="/en/documentation/products/deploy/edge-orchestrator/edge-node/" text="go to edge node reference documentation" variant="secondary"></Button>

---

## Step 6: Link an edge service to an edge node

Now, with the edge node created and authorized, you must link it with an edge service to be deployed onto the edge node.

- Create a relation between edge service and edge node.

<Button href="/en/documentation/products/guides/deploy/bind-service-node/" text="go to Bind an edge service to an edge node guide" variant="secondary"></Button>

Once this relation is in place, when an update is triggered on the edge services, it'll be deployed to all nodes related to this service in particular.
