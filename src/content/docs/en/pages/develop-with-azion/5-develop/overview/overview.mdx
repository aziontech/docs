At Azion, there are several tools and methods available to facilitate the development process, enhancing the efficiency and capabilities of developers. These tools cater to various aspects of development, including:

- Infrastructure management
- Testing
- Integration
- Code editing
- Application creation

## Azion CLI

Azion's Command Line Interface (CLI) allows developers to create static applications with various JavaScript frameworks effortlessly. This CLI tool streamlines the setup and deployment of static web applications, making it easier to develop and manage web projects.

## GraphQL API

Graphic Query Language (GraphQL) is a language created for use with APIs. It works as an alternative to REST APIs, allowing you to get data according to your needs. GraphQL gives you autonomy to request the data you want and receive exactly what you asked for through a JSON result.

As GraphQL fetches information differently from traditional APIs, it assists you in filtering data without overfetching. The precise response it provides also gives a better performance to those using GraphQL and makes it easier to use. Another difference from other APIs is that it has a single endpoint.

You can use the two Azion GraphQL APIs to perform a logpull of your data and maximize your analysis through:

- Real-Time Metrics GraphQL API, which provides aggregated metrics in real time.
- Real-Time Events GraphQL API, which provides raw logs in real time.

## Terraform Provider

Azion Terraform Provider is an open source project, registered in Terraform Registry that uses the Azion SDK (Go) to communicate with the Azion APIs, so you can manage your infrastructure hosted on the Azion platform, locally, as code.
