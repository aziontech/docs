Learn about the required process to create an [edge function](/en/documentation/products/build/develop-with-azion/language-specific/javascript/) that uses a [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/getting-started/developers-guide/) originated function.

1. On [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/), on the upper-left corner, select **Edge Functions** in the **Edge Libraries** section.
2. Click **Add a Function**.
3. Choose a name for your function.
4. Under **Language**, select **JavaScript**.
5. Copy and paste the following sample code to the code block:

```js
    async function handleRequest(request) {
      // You can either retrieve your .wasm file through fetch, for instance :
      // let wasmResponse = await fetch("http://somedomain/yourfile.wasm")
      // or embed the binary in the code, as shown below.
      const wasmCode = new Uint8Array([
        0, 97, 115, 109, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 6, 1, 96, 1, 127, 1, 127, 3, 2, 1, 0, 7, 13, 1, 9, 105, 110, 99, 114, 101,
        109, 101, 110, 116, 0, 0, 10, 9, 1, 7, 0, 32, 0, 65, 1, 106, 11,
      ]);

      const wasmModule = new WebAssembly.Module(wasmCode);
      const wasmInstance = new WebAssembly.Instance(wasmModule);
      const increment = wasmInstance.exports.increment;
      let value = 0;
  
      if (request.headers.has("value")) {
        let number = request.headers.get("value");
        if (!isNaN(number)) {
          value = parseInt(number);
        }
      }
      let incremented = increment(value);
      return new Response(
        "incrementing " + value + " we have " + incremented
      );
    }
    addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {
      event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request));
    });
```

The const `wasmCode` is the binary representation of the following [WAT](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Understanding_the_text_format) code:

```
    (module
    (type (;0;) (func (param i32) (result i32)))
    (func (;0;) (type 0) (param i32) (result i32)
      local.get 0
      i32.const 1
      i32.add)
    (export “increment” (func 0)))
```

:::note
[WAT](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Understanding_the_text_format) is the textual representation of the Wasm binary format, used to enable WebAssembly to be read and edited by humans.

6. Click the **Save** button.

Now, the function is ready to be instantiated in an edge application. Check how to [instantiate and execute the functions in your edge application](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-functions-instances/) and try it out.

The expected output of the recently created function is similar to:

```js
    incrementing 0 we have 1
```
