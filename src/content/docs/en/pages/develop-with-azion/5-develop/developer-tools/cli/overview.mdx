**Azion CLI** is a user-friendly way to work with the Azion Edge Platform, allowing you to create and manage applications through simple commands. It enables you to initialize, build, and deploy projects in several frameworks, such as:

- Next.js 
- Vue
- Angular
- Astro
- Hexo
- Vite

To get started, you'll need to [install the Azion CLI](). 

Depending on your computer's operating system, you can choose a simple installation method.

The Azion CLI will let you know when there's a new version available, ensuring you always have access to the latest features.

It also provides some options to customize your experience. For instance, you can check which version you're using, see detailed logs, and adjust various settings to fit your needs.
