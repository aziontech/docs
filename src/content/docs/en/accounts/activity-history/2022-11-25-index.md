# Activity History

On [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com/), you can access the history of activities performed on the account by all the users connected to it.

> The Activity History page displays results for the **last 30 days**. To view logs from previous dates, [contact the Support team](https://www.azion.com/en/support/).

This feature gives you information about when the action was performed and by whom.

To access the **Activity History** page, follow the next steps:

1. [Access RTM](https://manager.azion.com/).
2. On the upper-right corner of the page, select the avatar menu. This is the **Account menu**.
3. Select **Activity History**.

Once you open the page, you'll see the history from the most recent to the oldest activity of the account.

In the *search field*, you can filter the results by activity performed or by a user, for example.

You can also stream your Activity History logs by using them as a data source in Data Streaming. Find out more in the [Data Streaming]({% tl documentation_products_data_streaming %}#selecting-data-sources) page.
