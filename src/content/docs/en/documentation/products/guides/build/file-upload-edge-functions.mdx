## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- An [Azion account](https://manager.azion.com/signup/)
- [Azion CLI](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/azion-cli/) installed and configured
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 18 or higher
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package manager installed
- Basic understanding of JavaScript and Edge Functions
- **Edge Storage** enabled in your Azion account

## Getting started

### Step 1: Set up your development environment

1. Clone the file upload example repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/egermano/edge-functions-examples.git
cd edge-functions-examples/packages/file-upload
```

2. Install the project dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Review the project structure to understand the implementation:

```bash
ls -la
```

You should see the main files including the Edge Function implementation, configuration files, and example upload forms.

### Step 2: Configure environment variables

1. Create a `.env` file based on the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Edit the `.env` file to include your storage configuration:

```bash
# Storage configuration
STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME=your-upload-bucket
MAX_FILE_SIZE=10485760  # 10MB in bytes
ALLOWED_FILE_TYPES=jpg,jpeg,png,gif,pdf,txt,doc,docx
```

### Step 3: Create storage bucket

Create a bucket to store uploaded files:

```bash
azion create bucket your-upload-bucket
```

Replace `your-upload-bucket` with your preferred bucket name.

### Step 4: Build the project

Compile your Edge Function for deployment:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This command builds your Edge Function and prepares it for deployment to Azion's edge network.

### Step 5: Test locally

Before deploying, test your file upload function locally:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This starts a local development server where you can test file upload functionality.

## Deploying to Azion

### Step 1: Authenticate with Azion

1. Log in to your Azion account via CLI:

```bash
azion login
```

2. Follow the authentication prompts to connect your CLI with your Azion account.

### Step 2: Deploy the Edge Function

Deploy your file upload application to Azion's edge network:

```bash
azion deploy
```

The deployment process will:
- Upload your Edge Function code
- Configure the edge application
- Set up the necessary routing rules
- Configure storage permissions
- Provide you with a unique domain

### Step 3: Configure storage permissions

1. Access **Azion Console** > **Edge Storage**
2. Select your storage bucket
3. Configure appropriate permissions for your Edge Function to read/write files

### Step 4: Access your application

After deployment, you'll receive a domain like `https://xxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`. Your file upload application will be available at this URL within a few minutes after DNS propagation.

## Understanding the implementation

### File upload process

The file upload Edge Function typically handles:

1. **Request validation**: Checking file types, sizes, and security
2. **Multipart form parsing**: Processing multipart/form-data requests
3. **File processing**: Validating and preparing files for storage
4. **Storage upload**: Saving files to Edge Storage
5. **Response generation**: Returning upload status and file information

### Security considerations

- **File type validation**: Only allow specific file types
- **Size limits**: Enforce maximum file size restrictions
- **Virus scanning**: Implement malware detection when possible
- **Access control**: Validate user permissions before uploads
- **Input sanitization**: Clean file names and metadata

### Key benefits

- **Performance**: Upload processing at the edge reduces latency
- **Scalability**: Automatically scales with demand
- **Global reach**: Edge locations provide worldwide coverage
- **Cost efficiency**: Optimized data transfer and storage costs

## Testing your file upload application

### Step 1: Test file upload functionality

1. Navigate to your deployed application
2. Use the upload form to test various file types
3. Verify files are successfully stored in your Edge Storage bucket
4. Test file size limits and type restrictions

### Step 2: Test security features

1. **File type validation**: Try uploading restricted file types
2. **Size limits**: Test with files exceeding your size limit
3. **Malicious files**: Test with files containing suspicious content
4. **Path traversal**: Verify file name sanitization

### Step 3: Performance testing

1. **Upload speed**: Test with various file sizes
2. **Concurrent uploads**: Test multiple simultaneous uploads
3. **Error handling**: Test network interruptions and failures

## Common use cases

- **Document management**: Upload and store business documents
- **Image galleries**: Handle photo and image uploads
- **Media content**: Process video and audio file uploads
- **Form attachments**: Handle file attachments in web forms
- **Data import**: Process CSV and data file uploads

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues and solutions

- **Upload failures**: Check file size limits and allowed types
- **Storage errors**: Verify bucket permissions and configuration
- **Performance issues**: Optimize file processing and storage operations
- **Security concerns**: Review file validation and sanitization logic

### Error handling best practices

1. **Clear error messages**: Provide specific feedback to users
2. **Logging**: Implement comprehensive error logging
3. **Retry mechanisms**: Handle temporary failures gracefully
4. **Progress indicators**: Show upload progress for large files

## Advanced features

### Implementing file processing

You can extend the basic upload functionality with:

- **Image resizing**: Automatically resize uploaded images
- **Format conversion**: Convert files to different formats
- **Metadata extraction**: Extract and store file metadata
- **Thumbnail generation**: Create preview images

### Adding authentication

Implement user authentication to secure file uploads:

```javascript
// Example authentication check
function authenticateUser(request) {
    const authHeader = request.headers.get('Authorization');
    // Implement your authentication logic
    return validateToken(authHeader);
}
```

## Next steps

- Explore advanced file processing techniques
- Implement file deletion and management features
- Add user authentication and authorization
- Integrate with other Azion products like Edge Cache
- Monitor upload performance and optimize accordingly
