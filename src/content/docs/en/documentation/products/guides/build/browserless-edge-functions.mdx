This guide demonstrates how to create a browserless application using Azion Edge Functions. Browserless applications allow you to perform web automation tasks, scraping, and browser-based operations without the overhead of running a full browser instance, making them ideal for edge computing environments.

This demonstration shows how to leverage Edge Functions for browser automation tasks while maintaining high performance and security standards at the edge.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- An [Azion account](https://manager.azion.com/signup/)
- [Azion CLI](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/azion-cli/) installed and configured
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 18 or higher
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package manager installed
- Basic understanding of JavaScript and Edge Functions

## Getting started

### Step 1: Set up your development environment

1. Clone the browserless example repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/egermano/edge-functions-examples.git
cd edge-functions-examples/packages/browserless
```

2. Install the project dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Review the project structure to understand the implementation:

```bash
ls -la
```

You should see the main files including the Edge Function implementation and configuration files.

### Step 2: Configure environment variables

1. Create a `.env` file based on the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Edit the `.env` file to include any required configuration values for your browserless implementation.

### Step 3: Build the project

Compile your Edge Function for deployment:

```bash
pnpm dlx edge-functions@latest build
```

This command builds your Edge Function and prepares it for deployment to Azion's edge network.

### Step 4: Test locally

Before deploying, test your browserless function locally:

```bash
pnpm dlx edge-functions@latest dev
```

This starts a local development server where you can test your browserless application functionality.

## Deploying to Azion

### Step 1: Authenticate with Azion

1. Log in to your Azion account via CLI:

```bash
azion login
```

2. Follow the authentication prompts to connect your CLI with your Azion account.

### Step 2: Create storage bucket (if required)

If your browserless application needs to store files or data, create a storage bucket:

```bash
azion create bucket my-browserless-storage
```

### Step 3: Deploy the Edge Function

Deploy your browserless application to Azion's edge network:

```bash
azion deploy
```

The deployment process will:
- Upload your Edge Function code
- Configure the edge application
- Set up the necessary routing rules
- Provide you with a unique domain

### Step 4: Access your application

After deployment, you'll receive a domain like `https://xxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`. Your browserless application will be available at this URL within a few minutes after DNS propagation.

## Understanding the implementation

### Edge Function structure

The browserless Edge Function typically includes:

- **Request handling**: Processing incoming HTTP requests
- **Browser automation logic**: Implementing browserless operations
- **Response formatting**: Returning results in the appropriate format
- **Error handling**: Managing failures and edge cases

### Key benefits

- **Performance**: Runs at the edge, reducing latency
- **Scalability**: Automatically scales with demand
- **Cost-effective**: No need to maintain browser instances
- **Security**: Isolated execution environment

### Common use cases

- Web scraping and data extraction
- PDF generation from HTML
- Screenshot capture
- Form automation
- API testing and monitoring

## Testing your browserless application

1. **Functionality testing**: Verify all automation features work correctly
2. **Performance testing**: Ensure response times meet your requirements
3. **Error handling**: Test edge cases and error scenarios
4. **Security testing**: Validate input sanitization and output security

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues and solutions

- **Deployment failures**: Check your environment variables and build process
- **Runtime errors**: Review Edge Function logs in Azion Console
- **Performance issues**: Optimize your browserless operations for edge execution
- **Memory limitations**: Ensure your operations stay within Edge Function memory limits

## Next steps

- Explore advanced browserless automation techniques
- Implement monitoring and logging for your application
- Consider integrating with other Azion products like Edge Storage
- Scale your application based on usage patterns
