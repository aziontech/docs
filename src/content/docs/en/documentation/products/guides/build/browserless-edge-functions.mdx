This guide demonstrates how to create a browserless application using Azion Edge Functions. Browserless applications allow you to perform web automation tasks, scraping, and browser-based operations without the overhead of running a full browser instance, making them ideal for edge computing environments.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- An [Azion account](https://manager.azion.com/signup/)
- [Azion CLI](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/azion-cli/) installed and configured
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 18 or higher
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) package manager installed
- Basic understanding of JavaScript and Edge Functions

## Getting started

### Step 1: Set up your development environment

1. Clone the browserless example repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/egermano/edge-functions-examples.git
cd edge-functions-examples/packages/browserless
```

2. Install the project dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Review the project structure to understand the implementation:

```bash
ls -la
```

You should see the main files including the Edge Function implementation and configuration files.

### Step 2: Configure environment variables

1. Create a `.env` file based on the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Edit the `.env` file to include any required configuration values for your browserless implementation.

### Step 3: Build the project

Compile your Edge Function for deployment:

```bash
pnpm dlx edge-functions@latest build
```

This command builds your Edge Function and prepares it for deployment to Azion's edge network.

### Step 4: Test locally

Before deploying, test your browserless function locally:

```bash
pnpm dlx edge-functions@latest dev
```

This starts a local development server where you can test your browserless application functionality.

## Deploying to Azion

### Step 1: Authenticate with Azion

1. Log in to your Azion account via CLI:

```bash
azion login
```

2. Follow the authentication prompts to connect your CLI with your Azion account.

### Step 2: Create storage bucket (if required)

If your browserless application needs to store files or data, create a storage bucket:

```bash
azion create bucket my-browserless-storage
```

### Step 3: Deploy the Edge Function

Deploy your browserless application to Azion's edge network:

```bash
azion deploy
```

The deployment process will:
- Upload your Edge Function code
- Configure the edge application
- Set up the necessary routing rules
- Provide you with a unique domain

### Step 4: Access your application

After deployment, you'll receive a domain like `https://xxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`. Your browserless application will be available at this URL within a few minutes after DNS propagation.

## Understanding the implementation

### Edge Function structure

The browserless Edge Function typically includes:

- **Request handling**: Processing incoming HTTP requests
- **Browser automation logic**: Implementing browserless operations
- **Response formatting**: Returning results in the appropriate format
- **Error handling**: Managing failures and edge cases

### Key benefits

- **Performance**: Runs at the edge, reducing latency
- **Scalability**: Automatically scales with demand
- **Cost-effective**: No need to maintain browser instances
- **Security**: Isolated execution environment

### Common use cases

- Web scraping and data extraction
- PDF generation from HTML
- Screenshot capture
- Form automation
- API testing and monitoring

## Testing your browserless application

1. **Functionality testing**: Verify all automation features work correctly
2. **Performance testing**: Ensure response times meet your requirements
3. **Error handling**: Test edge cases and error scenarios
4. **Security testing**: Validate input sanitization and output security

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues and solutions

- **Deployment failures**: Check your environment variables and build process
- **Runtime errors**: Review Edge Function logs in Azion Console
- **Performance issues**: Optimize your browserless operations for edge execution
- **Memory limitations**: Ensure your operations stay within Edge Function memory limits

## Next steps

- Explore advanced browserless automation techniques
- Implement monitoring and logging for your application
- Consider integrating with other Azion products like Edge Storage
- Scale your application based on usage patterns
