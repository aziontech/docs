# Real-Time Events

**Real-Time Events** is an **Observe** module that allows you to display data from your Azion Products and Services in real time. You can use Real-Time Events to perform complex searches and explore data from your Azion applications.

See the [Real-Time Events first steps](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/real-time-events/first-steps/)

## 1. Data Sources {#DataSources}

The first step to explore your data is choosing the Data Source, which represents the Azion product or service that generated the events.

When submitting a search, the Data Source represents the index from where you want to collect data.

#### Azion provides the following Data Sources:

### Data Streaming

If you have contracted the [Data Streaming](https://www.azion.com/pt-br/docs/produtos/data-streaming/) product, this data source will display the event records of sending the data to your endpoints.

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| $client_id | Unique Azion customer identifier. |

## 2. Time Filter {#TimeFilter}

Real-Time Events keeps the events from the last *168 hours*. The Time Filter allows you to refine the event search result, and is selected by default for **Last 15 minutes**. You have the option of filtering with the following time ranges:

* Last 15 minutes
* Last 30 minutes
* Last 1 hour
* Last 3 hours
* Last 6 hours
* Last 12 hours
* Last day
* Last 2 days
* Last 3 days
* Last 5 days
* Last 7 days

> **Note:** by using the *Custom* field, you can also customize your search by selecting a time range during the last 168 hours.

***

## 3. Filter by {#filterby}

In the _Filter by_ field, you can optionally filter your search results using a keyword or phrase.

When submitting a search with a blank _Filter by_ field, you will get all existing records in the Data Origin for the selected time filter.

The searches are restricted to a particular field, using the notation: `key='value'`, such as `status='200'`. In this case, you will filter only the records which have these specified pair, value and key. As key, you can use the variables from the tables above, but note that each _Data Source_ has _its own_ list of variables.

> Time filter is done using the **_Time Filter_** or **_Custom_** fields, for this reason it is not possible to use the "timestamp" key in the filter.

You may search for more complex field compositions. Use the notations AND, OR and NOT in the search field to combine the fields, such as `status='200' AND scheme='https'`.

The _Filter by_ field uses SQL language, therefore you must use “_equals_” (=) after the key and “_single quotes_” ( ' ) around values, for example: `status='200'`.

If you intend to search for a more generic value, you can use the “_like_” operator instead of “_equals_”, exactly like you use in SQL queries. The final query for this search can be `host like '%mydomain%'`.

Depending on the size of our data, the query limit may exceed. If this happens, please filter by a short time filter.

***

## 4. Refresh {#Refresh}

The search always returns the results ordered by the time of the event, from the most recent to the oldest.

You can use the Refresh button to update the returned data, repeating the last search performed.
