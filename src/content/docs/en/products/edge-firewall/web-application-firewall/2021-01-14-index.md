# Web Application Firewall

The **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** protects your applications against threats such as SQL Injections, Remote File Inclusion (RFI), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and more. WAF scans HTTP/HTTPS requests, detect and block malicious activities before reaching your infrastructure and without impacting your applications performance.

It is a barrier that uses a set of rules to filter and monitor the traffic between your application and the internet. It operates in layer 7, known as the application layer, where applications access network services.

***

## 1. How it works 

**Web Application Firewall** is an Azion **Edge Firewall** module, based on the request scoring methodology. Each HTTP/HTTPS request is compared to a set of extremely restrictive blocking rules and receives a score for each family of threat.

According to the received score by the request, it can be released or blocked directly at Azion’s **Edge Nodes** before the threat reaches your origin or causes any damage. You define the desired sensitivity level to block each threat family.

To avoid blocking licit requests and malfunctioning of your application, you must run a learning stage, in which the *WAF Rule Set* identifies legitimate behaviors in your application, inserting them into an *Allowed rules* list.

You can also monitor the behavior and effectiveness of your **Web Application Firewall** settings. Azion provides dashboards and reports for online and real-time event log checks through our **Real-Time Events** and **Data Streaming** tools.

Furthermore, you may import Azion’s log records and manipulate them within your own analysis tools.

> To use your *WAF Rule Sets* resources you need to enable the **Web Application Firewall** module in the **Edge Firewall** *Rule Set*.

### Families of Threats

Threats are categorized into families, according to the purpose of the attack. You can enable or disable protection for each threat family individually, according to the protections required by the type of your application and the features it provides.

| Threat Type                 | Description                                                                                             |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SQL Injections Sensitivity  | It detects attack attempts by injecting SQL code into the application.                                  |
| Remote File Inclusions (RFI)| It detects attempts to include files, usually through scripts, on the web server.                       |
| Directory Traversal         | It prevents exploitation of vulnerability regarding insufficient sanitization of file name fields provided by users, so that characters representing shortcuts to the parent directory are passed through the file API. |
| Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  | It prevents the injection of client-side scripts into pages viewed by your visitors.                    |
| File Upload                 | It detects the attempt to upload files to the web server.                                               |
| Evading Tricks              | It prevents some coding tricks used to try to evade the protection mechanisms.                          |
| Unwanted Access             | It detects attempts to access administrative or vulnerable pages, bots and security scanning tools.     |
| Identified Attacks          | It prevents several types of common attacks and known vulnerabilities that should certainly be blocked. |

### Sensitivity

Sensitivity defines how strictly the WAF will consider a request as a threat, see the details of each level below.

#### Lowest

It is a lower level of sensitivity. The request will be considered a threat if it presents very strong evidence and receives a high score. This sensitivity has a lower level of protection for your applications, but it will also avoid blocking requests with less chance of false positives.

#### Low

Low protection, but not as low as the *lowest*. The request will be considered a threat if it presents very strong evidence and receives a high score. This sensitivity has a lower level of protection for your applications, but it will also avoid blocking requests with less chance of false positives.

#### Medium

It is the level of sensitivity recommended by Azion. The request will be considered a threat if it presents sufficient evidence and receives an intermediate score.

#### High

It is the high level of protection for your application. At the slightest hint of a threat, the request can be blocked, even when it has a relatively low score. This level of sensitivity may have more false positives if the learning stage does not have enough coverage of the variability of scenarios and uses of your application.

#### Highest

It is the highest level of protection for your application. At the slightest hint of a threat, the request can be blocked, even when it has a very low score. This level of sensitivity may show many false positives, if the learning stage does not have enough coverage on the variability of scenarios and uses of your application.

### Tuning (WAF self-calibration)

You can customize which rules will be allowed through *WAF self-calibration* as follows.

1. Go to the *Tuning* tab and fill in the *Domain(s)*, *Time Range* and *Network* fields.
2. Click the *Apply filter* button to view the *Possible Attacks List*.
3. Select the checkbox for the rules you want to allow and click *Allow Rules*.
4. A confirmation window will open, enter information related to the rule you want to allow and click *Allow Rules*. Added rules can be seen, edited or deleted in the *Allowed Rules* tab.

> If you want to delete a created rule, go to the *Allowed Rules* tab and click the trash can icon. Then, type *delete* in the confirmation window and click the *Delete* button.

*WAF self-calibration* enables you to create the allowed rules that are meaningful for your application in an easy and simplified way, with just a few clicks.

### Rules 

The set of rules which increase the score of a request. The bigger the score is, the higher is the probability of a request to be considered an attack by WAF.

Azion works with an extremely restrictive set of rules to ensure the security of your application. Each rule consists of the following fields.

| Field            | Description                                                                                                               |
|------------------|-------------                                                                                                              |
| Rule Id          | Unique numeric ID for each rule of the WAF.                                                                               |
| Rule Description | A textual description of what the rule does.                                                                              |
| Match Pattern    | Comparison condition, string or regex, which will be sought in the request.                                               |
| Path             | When specified, restrict the application of the Match Zone to the defined path only. Path delimits the scope of the rule. |
| Match Zones      | Parts or fields of the requisition that will be compared to the Match Pattern. These can be:<br/>* Path: match pattern will be compared to the path of the request.<br/>* Query String: match pattern will be compared to the query string, also called GET arguments.<br/>* Request Header: match pattern will be compared to the HTTP headers of the request.<br/>* Request Body: match pattern will be compared to the body of a POST, also called POST arguments.<br/>* File Name (Multipart Body): match pattern will be compared to the file names in multipart POSTs.<br/>* Raw Body: match pattern will be compared to body that was not interpreted from a request, also called unparsed body. |
| Attack Family    | The attack family(s) for which the rule increases the score.                                                              |

### Custom Allowed Rules

With *Custom Allowed Rules*, you are able to choose protocols to define allowed rules in your application. You can choose one or several policies to configure a setup, meaning you will authorize your **Web Application Firewall** to not see certain behaviors that could be interpreted as threats.
