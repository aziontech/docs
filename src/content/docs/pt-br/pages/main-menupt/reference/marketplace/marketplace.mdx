**Azion Marketplace** is a digital catalog that makes it easy to find, test, and deploy edge-running software. With a wide range of solutions, you can use them to improve, compose, or customize your applications.

Additionally, it provides an easy way for Azion to distribute the solutions easily to be used in your applications, as well as allowing Independent Software Vendors (ISVs), software developers, and open-source communities to distribute software to an audience of thousands of buyers.

As a digital catalog, it allows developers to implement a solution that meets their requirements, providing resources that can be used both inside and outside the **Azion Edge Platform**.

Azion Marketplace offers several advantages:
- **Wide range of solutions**: the available solutions cover different use cases and functionalities, such as security, performance, databases, artificial intelligence, and more.
- **Streamlined deployment and management**: in a few steps, you can discover, deploy, and configure solutions that can be easily integrated into your existing infrastructure.
- **Time and effort optimization**: by deploying ready-to-use solutions, you save time and effort. Additionally, you can easily scale your applications and services across a global network of edge servers, without requiring extensive manual setup.
- **Improved performance and user experience**: by leveraging Azion's network, applications using Marketplace solutions benefit from reduced latency and faster response times.
- **Enhanced security**: Azion offers solutions and services to protect your digital assets and mitigate threats, including bot management, validation, tokens, DDoS protection, web application firewalls, and more.

## How Azion Marketplace works

Azion Marketplace solutions are based on edge functions that can be triggered by specific events and execute specific tasks. The functions are composed of **Code** and **Args**, where **Code** defines the core behavior and can't be modified, and **Args** are the parameters to be used with the solution. Usually, the Args can be customized according to your needs.

This approach provides more flexibility to create new solutions to attend to different use cases, as well as allows users being able to adapt them to any particular demand.

By being executed on the edge, solutions based on edge functions offer a faster response time, and lower latency, resulting in better performance and user experience. Additionally, they use edge resources and capabilities to enforce security and compliance requirements.

The Azion Marketplace solutions are organized into various categories, making it easy to explore the available options. Currently, Azion Marketplace provides ready-to-use solutions in the areas of:

- **Security**: authenticate users, validate input data, route requests, define rate limiting, and scan and filter content to protect your applications from malicious attacks.
- **Performance**: reduce the load on your servers, minimize network latency, and accelerate content delivery, providing an improved experience for users.
- **Database**: manage your databases in a smooth way and generate dynamic content as demanded, such as personalized recommendations or geolocalized messages, based on user preferences or real-time data.
- **Edge AI**: implement facial recognition, ID matching tools, and accelerate and automate processes with state-of-the-art solutions.

## Type of solutions

In Azion Marketplace, you'll find solutions that run edge functions in two ways: by using [Edge Firewall](#edge-firewall-functions) or by using [Edge Application](#edge-application-functions). The Edge Firewall functions are focused on network security, authentication, and traffic control, while Edge Application functions are the best fit to process data or run services on the edge, closer to the user.

After accessing Azion Marketplace, you can find a suitable solution for your needs and start the installation process. The details depend on the type of function of the solution you choose.

Check [Azion’s guides page](/en/documentation/products/guides/#marketplace) for more details on the installation for each solution.

### Edge Application functions

By using an edge application, these solutions run tasks and services on the edge, closer to the user. This type of solution is recommended for scenarios where it's necessary to guarantee low latency, fast real-time data processing, and optimized bandwidth usage. In this matter, Azion Marketplace provides solutions related to databases, massive redirect, a/b testing, and signed cookies, among others.

The installation of this type of solution requires completing certain steps:

1. Solution installation: to get and install the solution through Azion Marketplace.
2. Solution configuration: to select the edge application you want to use with the solution.
3. Solution instantiation: to add a function and set the Args.
4. Rules Engine setup: to create a new rule, with the *criteria* and *behavior* to apply to your function.

Certain solutions may have dependencies and require more actions. Visit [Azion’s guides page](/en/documentation/products/guides/#marketplace) to check the step-by-step process for each solution.

### Edge Firewall functions

These functions take advantage of the features of Edge Firewall and Rules Engine to protect your network, applications, and resources from unauthorized access, malicious traffic, cyberattacks, bad bots, and other security threats. Some of Azion's solutions in this category include bot protection, hCaptcha, reCaptcha, secure tokens, and scheduled blocking, among others.

The installation of this type of solution requires completing certain steps:

- Solution installation: to get and install the solution through Azion Marketplace.
- Edge Firewall rule setup: to add a Rule Set and enable Edge Functions.
- Edge Firewall function setup: to add a function and set the Args.
- Edge Firewall Rules Engine configuration: to create a new rule, with the *criteria* and *behavior* to apply to your function.

Certain solutions may have dependencies and require more actions. Visit [Azion’s guides page](/en/documentation/products/guides/#marketplace) to check the step-by-step process for each solution.

## Solutions' update process

The solutions presented within the Marketplace aren’t static. Azion and Azion’s partners can update them when they launch new features. Thus, the recommendation is always to have the most updated solution, following the updated schedule of Azion or external providers.

To make sure that you’re running the latest version of the solution, go to Azion Marketplace and select the solution you want to update. By clicking the **Get new version button**, you'll download the solution’s latest version.

A message informing you the solution has been successfully updated will appear. Afterward, you can view all your solutions in your [Edge Functions list](https://manager.azion.com/edge-functions).

> Important: when you update a solution in Azion Marketplace, it won’t overwrite the version of the solution’s version you’re currently running on your edge application. This occurs to give you control over the version you want to use with your application.
>
> For instance, you could test a new version of a solution with a different edge application. So, when the new version has passed through your validation process, on your edge application, you can select it to run. To do so, change the solution version on the functions dropdown menu of your edge application.

## How-to guides

Each solution may have different configurations and dependencies to be installed and for them to work adequately. To find out how to configure a specific solution and be able to install it successfully, go to the [Azion's guides page](/en/documentation/products/guides/#marketplace) and select the guide related to the solution you want to use.

---

## Permissions

In order to use Marketplace properly, some solutions will need permissions to execute repeated actions on your account. This happens because some solutions have semi-auto installations. To understand more about the permissions, you can visit the [Marketplace Permissions](/en/documentation/products/guides/permissions-mktp/) documentation page.

## Business models

Azion Marketplace operates with the following business models:

- **Free model**: launch the solution on the go, and pay only when you use it. Subject to terms of use.
- **Bring your own License (BYOL)**: bring your current license or credentials from external providers.

> By using third-party solutions, you'll need to provide valid credentials to authenticate your account and connect Azion with the provider.
