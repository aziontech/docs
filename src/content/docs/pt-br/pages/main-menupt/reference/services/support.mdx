## Response Time

The response time depends on the type of support contracted and the severity of the open ticket. The time elapsed between the opening of the ticket and the start of actions taken by Azion is counted.

### Ticket Severity

Our goal is to provide an appropriate level of urgency to each case based on the impact on your business. Opening tickets with the correct severity level will help us get you in touch with the appropriate support professionals and within the desired response times.

#### To understand how Azion regards the severity of tickets, please see the table:

| Ticket Severity               | Definition |
|-------------------------------|------------|
| General Guidance | You have a question or want to request a feature.            |
| System impaired | Non-critical functions of your application are behaving abnormally or you have an urgent development question using Azion products. |
| Production system impaired | Important functions for your application are compromised or degraded. |
| Production system down | You have no way around the problem and your business is significantly impacted. Important functions of your application are unavailable. |
| Business-critical system down | You have no way around the problem and your business is at risk. Critical functions of your application are unavailable. |

### Resolved Cases

As soon as we respond to your ticket, we will work with you to identify and resolve the issue. We will consider the case resolved if:

*   you agree that your problem has been fixed or your question has been answered;
*   you agree that the source of the problem is not with Azion;
*   you have not responded to an inquiry or request from us for four (4) days in a row.

## Working Scope

### Technical Support

Our technical support levels cover development and production issues for Azion products and services, along with other key components:

*   “*how-to*” questions about Azion services and features;
*   troubleshooting for the use of Azion products, together with customer resources;
*   troubleshooting for the Azion platform.

#### Azion Technical Support does not include:

*   access and modification of the customer's infrastructure, external to the Azion network;
*   development, modification and debugging of the client’s applications;
*   approval and modification of the customer's infrastructure, even when requested or recommended by Azion to enable integration or to solve any problem; 
*   search for a solution to problems in the customer's infrastructure or its suppliers, which impact the use of Azion's services;
*   support Best Practices Review, Go Live Support, Training, Custom Configurations and Security Response Team.

### Health Status and Notifications

Health Status and Notification provides you with insight into the status of the Azion services that suit your applications, allowing you to quickly identify when Azion is experiencing issues that can impact you. The dashboard displays relevant information chronologically which allows you to manage ongoing events, in addition to providing proactive notifications to support you in planning scheduled activities. With alerts triggered automatically by status changes of Azion resources, you will have the visibility and guidance to help you quickly diagnose and resolve issues. Check it out on [Azion Status Page](https://status.azion.com/). 

### Best Practices Review

The Azion Trusted Advisors are base on the best practices learned from the history of operating and serving thousands of use cases. The Trusted Advisor analyzes your environment at Azion and then informs you of opportunities to save money, improve system architecture, availability and performance, or help mitigate security vulnerabilities. You can request an analysis through the Support Portal, informing the website you want to be reviewed and the intended objective: optimization with a focus on cost savings, performance, availability or security.

### Go Live Support

Ideal for launching applications, infrastructure migrations and live events, our Go Live Support provides real-time guidance and support for the most relevant moments for your business. Azion experts conduct a highly focused engagement to provide architectural and operational guidance, as well as real-time support, lasting up to 6 hours of follow-up, at any time, for your planned event. Go Live Support for your event can be booked through the Support Portal, 72 hours in advance.

### Training

Whether you are new to Azion or an advanced user, with Azion Training you can design your training schedule with us and always learn or validate useful concepts and implementation techniques using our services, from introductory to advanced features.

### Custom Configurations

Azion Custom Configurations provides the technical support you need to deploy complex configurations, not supported in the Real-Time Manager interface or APIs, so you can exploit the full potential of the Azion platform.

### Security Response Team (SRT)

With Azion Managed DDoS Protection Unlimited you have 24×7 access to the Security Response Team (SRT), which can be triggered during or after a DDoS attack. The SRT will assist in tracing incidents, identifying the root cause and applying mitigations for you. You can also engage the SRT for any post-attack analysis.
