[Edge Application](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/) allows you adjust various delivery settings and define the variables of your application. It also enables you to automate actions at the request-response level. 

Azion provides a range of tools to configure your application at the edge: 

- [Real-Time Manager (RTM)](https://manager.azion.com): provides a user-friendly interface to configure your application and monitor data.
- [Azion CLI](/en/documentation/products/build/develop-with-azion/cli/): enables the team to interact with Azion's system directly from the command line interface.
- [Azion API](https://api.azion.com): allows you to integrate and automate application deployment, scaling, and monitoring processes.
- [Terraform](/en/documentation/products/terraform-provider/): integrate your infrastructure with Azion using Terraform.
- [Azion SDK](/en/documentation/devtools/sdk/go/): improve the development of your Go application.
- [Edge Runtime](/en/documentation/products/edge-application/edge-functions/runtime/overview/): leverage APIs for networking and data handling.

## Step 1: Configure application

After you [create your application](/en/documentation/products/start-with-a-template/), you can change the protocols, delivery ports and the encryption type that it uses to interface with your end-users. 

For protocols, can choose whether to deliver your application via **HTTP or HTTPS**. HTTP is largely used in instances where the data being transferred doesn't need to be secure, whereas HTTPS provides an extra level of security through encryption. A customized **delivery port** can optimize network traffic, helping you to better manage the data flow, which can improve the speed and efficiency of your network. More importantly, it improves security by making the entry point into your networks less predictable.

As for encryption, implementing [Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption](/en/documentation/products/guides/create-a-digital-certificate/) to HTTPS applications ensures that data transfers between user devices and your servers are private.

Start by [customizing your main settings](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/configure-main-settings/) and [linking your application to a domain](/en/documentation/products/guides/configure-a-domain/).

## Step 2: Set variables

Next, you can configure your application's behavior by setting variables and parameters that can be customized for each application to fit the requirements of your application. You can define the following instances:

- **Cache setting**: [tune cache settings at the edge](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/tune-cache-settings/) to reduce the load on origin servers and speed up delivery. Define values such as browse and edge cache expiration, file slicing, cache keys, and adaptive delivery based on devices.
- **Origin setting**: [adjust your origin settings](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/work-with-origins/) to fit the needs of your application and define your the values of the `Host` header and address. 
- **Device group**: [group end-users based on their devices](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/create-device-groups/), operating systems, or browsers with information provided by the `User-Agent` header.
- **Edge function**: [instantiate functions](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/instantiate-edge-functions/) to minimize resource usage by processing at the edge.

Some variables may have already been created by default when you first built your application. You can edit your default settings or create new ones if necessary.

## Step 3: Activate settings

To use your variables, you need to [set up rules](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/work-with-rules-engine/) that trigger specific actions in your application. 

In both the request and response processing stages, you can tailor a set of rules to handle requests according to the requirements of your application. This allows you to automate responses to user interactions, manage data flow, and carry out tasks based on incoming requests or outgoing responses, all governed by conditional business logic.
