The **Jamstack** architecture at the edge has emerged as a game-changing paradigm, 
combining the power of serverless computing with the efficiency of edge locations. At its core, Jamstack, 
which stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup, decentralizes traditional web server functions, pushing them closer to the user. 
This shift not only accelerates website loading times but also enhances security and scalability.

## Vulcan

[Vulcan](https://github.com/aziontech/vulcan) is a powerful, **open-source** tool designed to streamline the development and deployment of JavaScript applications and frameworks. This powerful **framework adapter** automates polyfills for Edge Computing, significantly simplifying the process of creating Workers, particularly for the Azion platform.

One of the key highlights of Vulcan is its ability to establish an intuitive and efficient protocol for facilitating the creation of presets. This makes customization and adaptation to specific project needs even more accessible, providing developers with the necessary flexibility to optimize their applications effectively and efficiently.

## Azion CLI 

At Azion, you can initialize, build, secure, and deploy edge applications making use of a list of frameworks. It's possible through the combination of Vulcan and [Azion CLI](/en//documentation/products/azion-cli/overview/), which
makes the necessary adaptation for the frameworks to run as they should on the Azion Edge Platform.

The following table brings the frameworks that are adapted to the edge: 

| Framework | CLI | RTM |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Angular | [How to build with Angular](/en/documentation/products/build/develop-with-azion/frameworks-specific/angular/) | [Angular boilerplate](/en/documentation/products/guides/angular-boilerplate/) |
| Astro | [How to build with Astro](/en/documentation/products/build/develop-with-azion/frameworks-specific/astro/) | [Astro boilerplate](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/astro-boilerplate/) |
| Hexo | [How to build with Hexo](/en/documentation/products/build/develop-with-azion/frameworks-specific/hexo/)| - |
| Next | [How to build with Next](/en/documentation/products/build/develop-with-azion/frameworks-specific/next/) | [Next boilerplate](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/nextjs-static-boilerplate/)|
| React | [How to build with React](/en/documentation/products/build/develop-with-azion/frameworks-specific/react/) | [React boilerplate](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/react-boilerplate/)|
| Vite | [How to build with Vite](/en/documentation/products/build/develop-with-azion/frameworks-specific/vite/)| - |
| Vue | [How to build with Vue](/en/documentation/products/build/develop-with-azion/frameworks-specific/vue/) | [Vue boilerplate](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/vue-boilerplate/)|



Ultimately, the combination of Jamstack architecture at the edge with these JavaScript frameworks unlocks a world of possibilities, enabling developers to craft fast, secure, and scalable applications that push the boundaries of what's technically achievable on the modern web.
