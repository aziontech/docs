This page shows you the basic information of your application, including name, deployment logs, and the Azion domain, as well as some recommendations regarding advanced options to enhance your edge application

### Key configurations

After the deployment, each template creates a new edge application and its Azion domain; in some cases, it could create a new edge function as well. Each template also establishes some pre-defined key configurations to optimize your application's performance.

Additionally, to guarantee the optimal performance of certain templates, it could be necessary to activate some Azion products.
