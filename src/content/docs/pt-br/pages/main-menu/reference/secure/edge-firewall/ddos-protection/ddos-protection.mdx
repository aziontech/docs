**DDoS Protection** is an [Edge Firewall](/en/documentation/edge-firewall/) module that protects your applications against *Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)* attacks at the network, transport, and application levels (layers 3, 4, and 7 of the OSI model, respectively).

DDoS Protection runs specific algorithms directly on Azion's distributed network to detect small attacks coming from a single IP and large-scale attacks coming from criminal botnet networks.

The mitigation of DDoS attacks is carried out by Azion and doesn't impact the performance of its applications. Also, it doesn't require specific configuration, but it's possible to configure custom rules for specific detection and mitigation.

## Modalities of DDoS Protection

Azion offers four different modalities for DDoS protection:

1. **DDoS Protection - 5Gbps**
2. **DDoS Protection - 20 Gbps**
3. **DDoS Protection - 50 Gbps**
4. **DDoS Protection - Unlimited**

## DDoS Protection 5Gbps

**DDoS Protection - 5Gbps** is the initial modality. It requires no configuration and is included in Azion's service for all customers. With DDoS Protection - 5Gbps, the traffic of your web applications and APIs is monitored in real time, through anomaly analysis algorithms and traffic signatures.

Applications protected by this modality will have automatic mitigation against the most common DDoS attacks at the network and transport layers (layers 3 and 4 of the OSI model, respectively), such as *Slow Read DDoS* and *SYN-ACK Flood*, of up to 5 gigabits per second. Mitigation is automatic and doesn't impact the response latency of your application.

> For protection against attacks of any volume and for protection of your infrastructure, see DDoS Protection - 20Gbps, 50Gbps, and Unlimited.

### Always-on mitigation

Azion **Always-on DDoS Protection** continuously monitors network flow by inspecting incoming traffic and using *Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)*. It also provides advanced traffic analysis and signature algorithms to detect and block malicious traffic in time and with no impact to your applications.

You can also optimize protection against DDoS attacks at the application layer (layer 7) using the Edge [Firewall Web Application](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/web-application-firewall/) [Firewall](/en/documentation/products/edge-firewall/) module.

## DDoS Protection - 20Gbps, 50Gbps and Unlimited

In addition to all the functionalities of the 5Gbps modality, **DDoS Protection - 20Gbps, 50 Gbps and Unlimited** has extra functionalities for detection against more sophisticated and large-scale attacks. It also has integration with **Edge Firewall**.

### Flexible and customizable protection

Azion will be able to apply customized rules to mitigate sophisticated attacks from the network, transport, and application layers. These rules can be applied instantly, allowing you to quickly and efficiently protect your content or application. You can implement custom rules to mitigate specific attacks, using **Edge Firewall** and **Web Application Firewall**.

### Advanced detection

Azion DDoS Protection offers advanced detection, inspecting network flows, as well as monitoring each application layer for its resources delivered by Azion using Edge Firewall and Web Application Firewall. It uses advanced algorithms and *Software-defined Networking (SDN)* for granular detection and mitigation of DDoS attacks, such as **HTTP Floods**, **HTTP Slow Reads**, **DNS Query Floods**, **SYN/ACK Flood**, and many others.

### Mitigation of complex attacks

DDoS Protection - 20Gpbs, 50Gbps and Unlimited offer more sophisticated algorithms for automated attack mitigation. The 20Gbps modality is suitable for medium-sized companies and offers protection against DDoS attacks of up to 20 gigabits per second. The 50Gbps modality is suitable for large companies and offers protection against DDoS attacks of up to 20 gigabits per second. The Unlimited modality is indicated for companies that use Azion in mission-critical systems, with a direct impact on business results, and that want protection against any volume of attack.

### Support for add-ons extensions

DDoS Protection - 20Gbps, 50Gbps and Unlimited also have support for *add-ons*, such as **Infrastructure Protection** and **DNS Protection**, which together guarantee the protection of your entire *Autonomous System (AS)* infrastructure and your *Domain Name System (DNS)* service.

#### Protecting your infrastructure with Infrastructure Protection

The **Infrastructure Protection** add-on allows you to protect your own *Autonomous System Number (ASN)* infrastructure against DDoS attacks. The mitigation of DDoS attacks against your infrastructure is performed using *Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)* and can be activated during an attack or remain always-on.

#### Protection for your DNS with DNS Protection

The **DNS Protection** add-on allows you to protect your DNS service from DDoS attacks. By keeping your DNS Master server hidden and spreading Azion's DNS servers to the internet, you'll rely on Azion to ensure the continuity of your services. The Azion DNS service is distributed in many different geographic locations and has protection against DDoS attacks.

Azion's DNS servers get their configuration from the customer's Master server, whether it's inside their infrastructure or in the cloud. If your infrastructure already uses the [DNSSEC](/en/documentation/products/intelligent-dns/dnssec-compatibility/) extension, you can count on DDoS Protection without giving up the guarantee of integrity and authenticity of your records, thus providing security and availability for address resolution for your business.

### Attack visibility

Azion DDoS Protection offers complete visibility of application attacks through Real-Time Manager (RTM) or API to be able to view the attack volume. In conjunction with the **Security Response Team (SRT)**, you'll have access to post-event analysis and investigations.

### Security Response Team (SRT)

DDoS Protection - Unlimited offers 24-hour access to Azion's *Security Response Team (SRT)* by contracting support for **Mission Critical**, as well as cost protection during attacks. The SRT can be contact during the attack, after an attack, or even preventively, in the construction of customized rules. Whenever contacted, the SRT will support you in incident triage, root cause identification and application of necessary mitigations on your behalf.

> For more information on the Security Response Team (SRT) and Support Mission Critical, contact the [specialized team](https://www.azion.com/en/support/).

### Cost protection in case of surprise attack

DDoS Protection includes **Cost Protection** for your Azion services, a measure to guarantee your Azion costs will not increase after a volumetric attack. If the usage of any of your Azion services expands in response to a DDoS attack, Azion will provide service credits to avoid overage charges after peak usage cases.
