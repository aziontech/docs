With Azion, you can create and run applications directly on the edge. To allow access to your application through the browser and start receiving users and monitoring metrics, you need a domain. With [Domains](/documentation/products/edge-application/domains/), Azion provides a free domain address in the format `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net`. When users access your application through this Azion domain, the nearest node within the edge network fetches and delivers the edge application.

## Via RTM

When you create an application [using a template](/en/documentation/products/start-with-a-template/) or [via CLI](/en/documentation/products/build/develop-with-azion/cli/), your application is automatically associated with an Azion domain. To check your created domains:

1. [Access RTM](https://manager.azion.com).
2. On the upper-left corner of the page, open the **Products menu**, represented by three horizontal lines, and then select **Domain**.

This screen shows your list of domains, as well as their addresses. You can [configure a domain](#configure-your-domain) by clicking the domain from the list. If you've created an edge application but you don't see a domain listed, you need to create a domain:

1. Click the **Add Domain** button.
2. Give your domain a name.
3. In **Edge Certificate**, select the **Azion SAN** certificate.
4. In **Edge Application**, select your edge application.
5. In the **CNAME** field, you may list custom domains to link to your application; for example: `yourdomain.com`. See the [custom domains section](#custom-domains) to know more.
6. Disable the **CNAME access only switch**. This will enable users to access your application using the `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net` address.
7. Click the **Save** button.

Wait some minutes for your new domain to propagate to the edge nodes and access your `xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net` address. You should now see your edge application online.

## Via API

1. Run the following `POST` request in your terminal, replacing `[TOKEN VALUE]` with your [personal token](/en/documentation/products/guides/personal-tokens/), the `<edge_application_id>` variable with the `id` of your edge application:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.azionapi.net/domains' \
--header 'Accept: application/json; version=3' \
--header 'Authorization: Token [TOKEN VALUE]'\
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "name": "example.org - domain",
    "cname_access_only": false,
    "digital_certificate_id": null,
    "edge_application_id": <edge_application_id>
}'
```

  | Key | Description |
  | --- | --- |
  | `name` | Sets the string in value as a name of the domain entry with Azion. You may modify this value to fit your needs, since it does not represent a domain address. |
  | `cname_access_only` | When set to `false`, enables access via the Azion address. |
  | `digital_certificate_id` | When `null`, selects the **Azion SAN** certificate. If you want to associate your own certificate, see [Create a digital certificate](/en/documentation/products/guides/create-a-digital-certificate/#via-api). |
  | `edge_application_id` | The ID of the edge application linked to the domain. To get the ID, see [Build with Edge Application](/en/documentation/products/guides/build/build-with-edge-application/#via-api) |

2. You'll receive a response similar to:

```json
{
    "results": {
        "id": 1693407350,
        "name": "example.org - domain",
        "cnames": [],
        "cname_access_only": false,
        "digital_certificate_id": null,
        "edge_application_id": <edge_application_id>,
        "is_active": true,
        "domain_name": "xxxxxxxxxx.map.azionedge.net",
        "is_mtls_enabled": false,
        "mtls_verification": "enforce",
        "mtls_trusted_ca_certificate_id": null
    }
}
```

3. The `domain_name` received in the response carries your application's Azion domain as a string. Wait a few minutes for the changes to propagate and paste its value without the double quotes (`"`) in your browser to access your application.

## Link a custom domain to your application

In addition to the default Azion domain, you have the option to associate a **custom domain** in CNAME format, such as `yourdomain.com`, with your application. This allows you to customize the domain name that users will use to access your application.

When a user enters the custom domain name in their browser, a DNS lookup process takes place. During the DNS lookup, the user's browser sends a request to a DNS server to find the IP address associated with the custom domain. The DNS server checks its database to find the corresponding IP address for the custom domain name. If the custom domain is configured to point to the Azion domain, the DNS server returns the IP address of the nearest edge node in the Azion network.

Once the user's browser receives the IP address, it establishes a connection with the appropriate edge node. The edge node then serves the requested content, and the user's browser displays the edge application.

You can choose to customize your domain by [associating a domain record](/en/documentation/products/guides/point-domain-to-azion/) or [migrating your name resolution to Azion](/en/documentation/products/guides/migrate-ns-to-azion/).
