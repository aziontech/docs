## About Us ℹ️

We are an edge computing platform that allows you to build and run applications anywhere. Our documentation is a crucial part of ensuring our users have the best experience with our products and services. 🌐🚀

The documentation portal is built on [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/) and leverages [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx/) to build experience-focused content with front-end components, going beyond text.
